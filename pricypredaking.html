    Predaking's Cyberverse-scaled
form is certainly a winged, "traditional" dragon, but it has considerably
differerent proportions from his other toys (and especially the show model).
His body makes up considerably more of his mass on this toy due to his
tranformation, while his wings are outright tiny compared to the huge,
sweeping things they are on the show. His four appendages are also a bit
short-- especially the back legs, as those are so tiny proportionally that
they just look kind of ridiculous; it's hard to imagine him moving much
on those stubby little things. His silouhette also slopes upward considerably
more, with the neck molded into a raised position and his head far above
the rest of his body. His tail is fairly short as well due to his tranformation,
but not
    <i>
     quite
    </i>
    enough where it looks ridiculous like his back legs.
There's also one fairly obvious robot mode extra in this mode-- it's obvious
that the back two-thirds or so of his body are made from his robot legs,
given their rather distinct shape and detailing. His robot head is also
slightly visible underneath his chest, but that's small bananas, particularly
on this small of a figure. However, despite all this, there are certainly
positives about this mode. For one, his mold detailing is very well-done--
among the most detailed out of the Prime Cyberverse toys. The intricate
armor plating/scales on his neck, tail, and accurate dragon headsculpt
all look absolutely ace, and there's a pretty good amount of detailing
on his legs and wings, as well. (His wings have a feathery look to them,
though, which is definitely a departure from all other toys of this figure,
not to mention the show model.) Predaking's general color scheme takes
a hint from his
    <a href="g1predaking.html">
     G1 gestalt counterpart
    </a>
    and
is primarily the "Halloweeny" colors of orange and black, both of which
contrast against each other very well. There's also a fair amount of milky
gray (more obvious in robot mode), and while I'm not fond of the color,
it's not of the super-bland very light variety, and there's a bit of swirly
look to it that I like. A few accent paint apps of silver and yellow help
to round out the color scheme-- I particularly like the addition of yellow,
which both contrasts with the black and complements the orange. There's
a bit of orange paint used on Predaking's head, but it's noticeably duller
than his orange plastic-- I'm not sure why they didn't use a lighter shade
to match, there. Other than Predaking's wings and legs (which, again, are
small little things), he's pretty well-covered in terms of paint. For articulation
in this mode, Predaking can move at where the wings meet the body, as well
as at the front shoulders (at two points), front elbows (at two points),
and SLIGHT side-to-side movement on the hips of his back legs; it's not
the most articulated beast mode.

    Predaking's transformation
is only a slight variation on the "stand me up and do a headflip" beast
transformation, with the variation being that his dragon back form his
legs, not his dragon rear legs, which are tucked mostly away behind his
lower robot legs and stay out of the way--- that's ONE positive for those
back legs being so small, at any rate. Predaking looks better and a bit
more imposing in this mode, though his wings still definitely should've
been able to fold out wider or something. His core body is proportioned
quiite well, with a fairly wide chest and powerful form. His head is just
a tad tiny and has rather ambiguous mold detailing (Does he have a mouth
or just a big chin? Why does the back end of the top of his skull point
upwards? Etc.). The mold detailing on the rest of the robot bits is quite
good, though, with some really nice alternating jagged/smooth details on
his chest that give him a bit of a "royal" appearance with all the orange
and yellow paint detailing on him; his head also has a good amount of paint
detailing on it. The rear legs are minor kibble issues, but Predaking does
have one major kibble issue in this mode, and that's his dragon head. It
hangs down behind his back, and the instructions SAY to split them into
two (pictured above); I generally don't like to do this, as it doesn't
look that good and makes those pieces more obvious. I prefer to just leave
it un-separated on his back; it gets in the way less that way. For articulation,
Predaking can move at the base of the wings and the neck, shoulders (at
two points), elbows (at two points), hips, knees, and slightly at the ankles--
about average for a Commander-class figure. He's a little back-heavy because
of his dragon head and wings, but you can still get him into some decent
poses. As for a weapon, Predaking can hold his tail in either of his hands,
which has a push-missile function, and is a decent little weapon for such
a small toy.

    Cyberverse Predaking
certainly has some positives-- his mold detailing is great (if at times
inaccurate to the show model), he's got decent articulation and great proportions
in robot mode, and a nice color scheme. However, he has plenty of proportional
issues in beast mode, and a few kibble issues. As such, this is my least
favorite toy of the character, and I recommend getting one of the larger
versions of him-- it'll have a much more commanding presence over your
Predacon army, anyways.
