    Crosshairs' Corvette
alt mode carries over pretty well proportionally to his Power Battler version;
not only are the proportions generally sound, but he's actually got the
black fragmented stripes on BOTH sides of this mode, unlike his initial
    <a href="aoecrosshairs.html">
     "mainline"
deluxe
    </a>
    release. As far as his overall construction goes, I only have
one complaint here, and that's the bits of robot mode that are visible
inside his (open) side windows; from the left side it doesn't look so bad
as it's a black piece sticking out out of the body of the vehicle, but
looking in from the right side that piece is painted silver, which is glaringly
obvious against the surrounding colors and really makes me wish those windows
had just been molded closed instead. As far as the color scheme, the green
and black work pretty well together, even if they're not the most exciting
colors in the world; the silver serves as a nice light color for them both
to play against, the black in particular. That said, the rear window isn't
painted silver like the front is, which makes the rear end look a bit boring
in comparison (the green stripes on the back end are also minimal, though
at least the taillights back there are silver). The grill and part of the
front hood are painted black, and the headlights silver-- so besides the
back end, all the major details are accounted for, here. One last note
about the colors, though, is that the green paint on Crosshairs is of a
noticeably lighter shade than the green plastic, which does look a bit
odd in vehicle mode where the two different shades meet.

    Crosshairs has the same
"Power Punch" gimmick as
    <a href="aoepbbee.html">
     Power Battler Bumblebee
    </a>
    and transforms in a very similar way, but mirrored; thus, many of my comments
about this mode from Bumblebee-- the ridiculously oversized lower "punch"
arm, the way the toy "punches" forward by rotating him at the waist, and
how bad the arm looks when not in its activated, "punching" position--
apply to this toy, as well. Crosshairs also has a similar "normal" arm,
which is just molded onto the underside of the car side. What's different
here is that the front section of the car mode flops down behind Crosshairs
waist like a bit of a "skirt"-- thus giving him at least a miniature version
of his signature "car bits cloak"-- with the legs having less kibble on
them in return and looking more normal proportionally. That said, the legs
are still a bit skinny (particularly above the knee) and look backwards
at the feet, and I wish the car hood behind his back looked at least a
little more like a cloak as opposed to an obvious bit of vehicle kibble.
The mold detailing in this mode is very impressive; Crosshairs' headsculpt
is spot-on, with characterisically narrowed eyes-- the silver paint on
his face and green on his goggles really helps to bring out all the details,
there. Other details like his faux car headlight-chest and relevant details
on the waist and legs are also done well. Heck, there's even a bunch of
circuitry, spinal, and robotic detailing on the underside of his car hood
pieces, which are completely unnecessary but appreciated. The color breakup
is still done well in this mode, with bits of silver, green, and black
paint breaking up the chest, arms, and legs very nicely, so that no one
large area is solely one color. For articulation, ignoring the spring-loaded
"Power Punch" gimmick movement, Crosshairs can also move at the right shoulder,
SLIGHTLY side-to-side at the hips, and... that's it. Thus he's a bit of
a brick, even by Power Battler standards, unfortunately.

    There are certainly
some positive things about Power Battler Crosshairs; he's got a well-proportioned
vehicle mode, some excellent robot mode mold detailing, and a good amount
of color variance &amp; paint apps in both modes. However, his "Power Punch"
gimmick simply sacrifices too much of what would make his robot mode good,
and he's almost a complete brick in terms of poseability. One of the worst
Power Battler molds; if you want a simpler-to-transform Crosshairs, I'd
go with the one-step changer version instead.
