    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Landmine. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Landmine

     Unlike most Botcon exclusives,
Landshark isn't based on any previous TF character, he's brand-new. In
many pictures his orange parts look too close to Energon Landmine's, but
thankfull in person they're not-- they're actually a bit duller, more coppery-orange
with some metallic flakes in it. His main color, besides black, is a similarly
metallic-flaked dark green, which is an interesting color that makes Landshark
look rather military-esque-- certainly fitting, given the "Elite Guard"
theme of the year. He also has some rather dull light gray that's already
way too common and boring-looking on mainline TF, so I really don't like
it on an expensive Botcon toy. There's some metallic flake in there to
spice it up a little, but it still looks rather blah. Overall the colors
go together fairly well-- it's not spectacular or anything, but it certainly
not bland or clashy. Honestly, compared to some other toys in the set,
he's just honestly forgettable, given that he's not an homage to anyone
or really stands out in anyway. I DO really like the metallic gunmetal
gray "teeth" paint apps on the back end of his vehicle mode/claws of his
"Brute" robot mode, though they should've been a lighter silver to contrast
better with the dark green. The metallic copper coloring around the windows
is also really nice-looking, and the adding the Elite Guard "wings" around
the molded Autobot symbol there was very creative.

     No mold changes have
been made to Landshark, though like many large Botcon toys he has had his
electronics removed.

     Landshark isn't a bad
repaint, though he's not a good one either. He's just kind of "meh" in
almost every respect, which honestly isn't something I like in uber-expensive
Botcon toys. The metallic copper and gunmetal gray paint apps look nice,
but that's all of the really "cool" stuff he's got going for him. Solely
based on colors, I'd recommend him over Landmine, but below

but given the price, I'd only get this guy if you're a completist or are
buying the whole boxset anyway so you have the whole Elite Guard team.

       Landshark doesn't know where he got
his name from, and he doesn't really care. Some 'bots tend to confuse it
with "Landmine," but once Landshark pulls his fist from their abdomen,
they don't seem to get it wrong anymore. Always the practical jokester
and seen by his peers as a wiseguy, he often makes light of even the most
dramatic situations. Once, he had one of his power claws ripped off his
body by a blood thirsty Narliphant. Landshark didn't fret about the situation;
he simply turned to Flak and asked, "Can you give me a hand?" ...Flak was
not amused. Able to transform his auxiliary battle platform into a hydraulic
booster pack, he has the strength to wield two massive power claws capable
of ripping open an enemy's armor plating. This feature also gives him the
ability to cling onto or climb up almost any structure. While in vehicle
mode, Landshark enjoys intimidating, then and plowing down, anyone that
stands in his way.
