    Beast mode is an earwig
bug. (I'm not sure what it is.) Looks very menacing, with a color scheme
almost exactly matching that of Antagony's. Not all that many extras if
seen from above. His robot legs can be seen under the body from a side
view, however. Articulation in this mode is pretty limited to the tail,
however, since his claws can open and close, and the parts of his insect
mouth.

    Robot mode is very organic-looking.
One of the downsides to this mode is that the insect legs on the arms can
get in the way some, and his hands don't really look like anything resembling
hands at all. His claw weapon is very nice-looking, but the lever that
moves the claws is in his hand in this mode, making the movement look rather
awkward. When you move it while in his hand, one of the claws stays put
while the other claw and the main body of the weapon move to one side.
Legs and trunk are fine, though.

actually better than the original, but, unfortunately, just as hard to
transform.

      Vice Grip is one of Megatron's most
loyal and dependable troops. He understands the value of a mission and
does his utmost to complete it successfully. This drive, coupled by his
extraordinary tracking abilities, is well received by the Predacon leader.
His comrades have deep respect for him and often look to him for guidance
and advice. In insect mode, his rear pincers can easily crush unsuspecting
Maximals, and then finish them off with a high-voltage electric surge.
I robot mode, the pincers convert to a hand-held pulse weapon that discharges
an explosive ball of electricity capable of shorting out Maximals in a
twenty meter radius.
