    Beast mode is one cool-looking
rat. With little bands of metal running around his head and a big fat rump
with one extremely articulated tail, this mode is cool, although theres
a lot of extra junk under him. However, this can be ignored, because it
doesn't get in the way much, if at all.

    His vehicle mode is
a rat rover. His back legs tuck in to become rolling wheels, to turbo engines
come out of his butt, and his front legs fold back to become little wheels.
Pretty awesome, in my opinion, the best Transmetal vehicle mode.

    His robot mode it the
only reason this guy didnt get above an 8.0. Theres a lot of extra junk
on his back, and he looks just a little too mean and muscular for a wimp
like Rattrap. All these extras get in the way and make Rattrap a tad top-heavy.
However, his rat tail whip is kinda cool and he has actual fists.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    I suggest you keep him
in beast or vehicle mode. Hes cooler that way- but that's just my opinion.

      Following the quantum surge, Rattrap
gained the advantage of a meched-out armor shell and a swift dragster vehicle
mode. A top-notch soldier, his fellow Maximals rely on his reconnaissance
reports to locate enemy outposts. The new hot rod mode has increased his
speed and agility on the battlefield, and a powerful, battle-whip blade
that we wields while in robot mode has made him a powerful adversary to
all Predacons.
