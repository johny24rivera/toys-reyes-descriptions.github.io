    Rodimus is back with
another toy-- this time a Legends-class toy. Design-wise, Rodimus' vehicle
mode is pretty good this time around. There's no robot mode extras whatsoever,
and there's not a lot of obvious gaps in the vehicle mode that make it
an eyesore or anything. All of the necessary details are there, such as
the headlights, tailights, etc.-- but JUST those details. He almost looks
Animated-esque in this mode because of this. What also contributes to this
feeling is that, quite frankly, Rodimus is a bit "wide" for a sportscar,
especially when you compare him to previous toys of the character. It doesn't
look sleek enough for the character. Honestly, if it wasn't for the paint
job and the spoiler, I wouldn't think it was Rodimus at all-- which is
certainly something worth pointing out for a mold designs specifically
TO evoke past versions of the character. As far as paint apps go, the purple-black
windows are a nice, unusual touch, and contrast quite well with the red.
Same with the black (though it's more apparent in robot mode than vehicle
mode). The flame deco paint apps are also well-done, though they could
stand to be a bit more widespread. I'm not fond of the metallic orange
used for the spoiler, though-- it's too close to the orange under most
lights, to the point where I wish they would've used that paint app somewhere
else (or at least in another color).

    Rodimus definitely evokes
more of his classic look in robot mode, with the overall structure being
very similar to past versions-- spoiler behind the head, shoulders made
out of the sides of the car mode, and the front car hood w/ flames being
used for the chest. The head sculpt is also quite well-done and spot-on
Rodimus, as well. The major problem I have with this mode is that Rodimus
isn't very posable, even for a Legends figure-- he can move at the hips
and at two points at the shoulders, but that's it. At least knee articulation
would've helped things immensely. He also has a bit of a noticeable gap
between the bottom of his chest and his waist, which looks odd, and the
roof of his car mode sticks out from behind his main body and kinda ruins
its "sleekness". Beyond these two caveats, though when it comes to looks
this mode's pretty good.

    Universe 2.0 Legends
Rodimus is one of the few Legends figures that I have more problems with
in vehicle mode compared to robot mode. Rodimus' robot mode does have a
few articulation problems and noticeable gap at the waist, but his vehicle
mode looks way too "chubby" and undetailed for his character, even considering
the limitations of the Legends-class scale. He's not bad by any means,
but there are several Universe 2.0 Legends figures I'd recommend before
this guy.
