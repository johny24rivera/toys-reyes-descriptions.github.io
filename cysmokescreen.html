    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Crosswise. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Crosswise

     Smokescreen is back,
though not as the same character as
     <a href="smokescreen.html">
      Armada Smokescreen
     </a>
     ,
even though Cybertron takes place in the same TF universe as Armada. Go
fig. This version of Smokescreen is instead an homage to
     <a href="g1smokescreen.html">
      G1
Smokescreen
     </a>
     , who has pretty much the exact same color layout in vehicle
mode, right down to the "38" numbers on the sides of the doors. The only
real difference is the "cutting off" of the blue and white stripes at the
midpoint of the car mode, though that fits in well aesthetically to the
point where it would look odd if it continued past that point. In fact,
compared to G1 Smokescreen, no real color additions have been made at all,
just more variations of a few of the colors on the original Smokescreen.
The new bluish white used on certain parts of the robot mode, for example,
looks quite good, and blends in with the surrounding red and white very
well. The colors on G1 Smokescreen fit together very well, so Cybertron
Smokescreen is of course no exception in this area. In fact, the new additions
like the aforementioned bluish white and the very attractive metallic shade
of blue look great and are particularly eye-catching.

     Cybertron Smokescreen
is a great repaint with some very nice homages to the G1 figure. It's a
shame that the original colors on this mold for Crosswise were so good--
if they were just a little worse, Smokescreen would have won out as the
better of the two. As such, I'd still have to recommend the use of this
mold as Crosswise slightly over its use as Smokescreen.

       Back on Cybertron, Smokescreen was considered
a practical joker. Always ready with a gag and a laugh, he kept the mood
light, even when the struggle against the black hole looked hopeless. Since
the fight against the Decepticons on Earth heated up though, his talent
for trickery has been turned against the enemy. More than one Decepticon
has been stuck in traffic at a series of nonfunctioning toll booths on
a remote road in the middle of the desert.
