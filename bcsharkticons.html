not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Sharkticon. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Sharkticon

     The Sharkticons are a
bit of oddity of this years' set, given that they're based off characters
firmly in G1 continuity and not in G2 or some "lost generation" late European
G1 era. Still, color-wise they fit right in. There's no way a color scheme
like this would come out on a mass-market toy-- light gray, tel, and pink?
Seriously? It's certainly loud, but in a paler, "chalkier" way than most
of the other Botcon 2010 toys, with the colors considerably less saturated.
It's almost like you're looking at him after going swimming in a pool with
too much chlorine and your eyesight is all washed out. To be honest, though,
I'm fine with fruity color schemes-- except for the pink. The pink, just--
not an attractive shade, even considering it's pink on a male Transformer.
The light gray goes fairly well with the pale blue and particularly the
light purple used for the front of the vehicle mode. The cherry red used
for the transparent bits looks particularly good and provides the sole
relatively dark color on the figure. The green is... okay, but honestly
it's adding another color to a scheme that doesn't need it. One thing definitely
in favor of the Sharkticons is that they have a ton of paint apps-- the
robot legs and arms could use a few more, but he's so covered in various
silve,r red, pink, purple, and green paint apps on his main body in both
modes that it's hard to let that minor caveat bother you too much.

     No mold changes have
been made to the Botcon Sharkticons-- they share the same head as the original
Energon Sharkticon.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     One good thing about
the Botcon Sharkticons is that, since they're troop-builders that are sold
in packs of three, they're considerably cheaper individually than other
Botcon exclusives of the same side. The downside is that, like many toys
in this fruity set, you'll either like it because it's so hideous and pale
it swings right back around to being good or you'll hate it on first sight.
So, the best advice I can probably give is stick with your gut reaction
upon first seeing the picture above. If you don't like it but still want
the (pretty darn awesome) mold as a new character, spring for

       Flying high above the Earth, Air Sharks
enjoy a privilege that the other two Sharkticon types rarely do; they fly
side-by-side with their captain shark, Sky-Byte. It is for this reason
alone that only the best Sharkticons receive the Air upgrade from their
eccentric leader.

       Air Sharks' main weapons consist of
twin air-to-ground missiles that decouple and disperse a wide spread of
smaller chargers. For closer combat, their metal teeth tear into any alloy
they can fit into their great maws. Once inside their mighty gullet, processing
systems prepare the materials for their true masters.

        The Land upgrade allows Sharkticons
the improved ability to tunnel through any terrain they might encounter.
Be it the dry, arid sands of the hottest desert or the cold, chilling icebergs
of the arctic north, a Land Shark swims through the Earth as a fish through
water. They dig their their mouths wide open, sending refined ores and
minerals across the vastness of space through sub-space transporters located
in their bottomless stomachs.

         The deep blue oceans of Earth feel like
home. ALthough they lack the yellow tinge of the Iodine seas the Sharkticons
once roamed, they are still ruled by the law that governs all bodies of
water; survival of the fittest. It's a rule that the Sharkticons exploit
to the fullest, as they terrorize schools of sardine, pods of whales, and
every Autobot foolish enough to step foot or pontoon into the ocean.

         Those Sharkticons given the Sea upgrade
have the ability to wage war both below and above the waves. When submerged,
twin torpedo launchers fire guided ordnance capable of delivering a 15
megaton warhead. On the ocean surface, multiple cannons mounted on the
top of the Sea Sharks' backs fire high velocity cobalt rounds.
