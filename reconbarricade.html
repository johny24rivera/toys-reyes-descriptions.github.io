    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Barricade
w/ Frenzy toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Barricade w/ Frenzy toy

     Recon Barricade is actually
sort of a downgrade, really-- instead of a full-blown police car, he's
not a security guard car, like you'd find around a mall or something. It
does make sense, though, given the prefix to Barricade's name-- he's more
"incognito" this time around, so he doesn't stick out as much as a normal
police car. Anyways, the color scheme is fairly good, with considerably
more color variation than the original Barricade toy-- the dark blue contrats
really nicely against the light gray, and the metallic silver-blue accents
are a really nice shade. Barricade's also got a considerable amount of
black visible in robot mode, which is good-- it just wouldn't be Barricade
without a fair amount of black, in my opinion. The vehicle mode does look
somewhat dull, though-- having all that light gray replaced with a metallic
silver would have worked wonders and make it look more realistic to boot.
The blue stripes and "Sheriff" logos on the side do look quite good, however,
and Barricade still has that hilarious "To Punish and Enslave" logo on
the sides of his vehicle mode. As far as his little ejectable Frenzy toy
goes, Recon Frenzy is completely blue now, as oppposed to a more realistic
gray. He's got some of the metallic bluish silver paint detailing on his
chest, but no red detailing for his optics or the like this time around.
I'd prefer if just the optics were painted, as the metallic bluish silver
coloration really doesn't stick out at all against all that dark blue--
it's pretty hard to see.

     Recon Barricade w/ Frenzy
is an interesting repaint, with a color scheme that's quite different but
still retains enough of Barricade's "darkness" in colors to still convincingly
pass as the same character. His robot mode looks great particularly, with
so many more colors apparent than on the mold's original paint job, but
his vehicle mode is admittedly pretty dull in appearance with all that
light milky gray. Plus, a completely blue Frenzy just looks weird, in my
opinion. I'd recommend the original release of the toy over this one.

       Now that the AllSpark has been located,
and Megatron freed, it comes time for the Decepticons to infiltrate the
human installation guarding their goal. As always, Barricade and Decepticon
Frenzy lead the charge. Disguised as local security, Barricade gazes hungrily
at the fragility of the structure and the destructive power of the millions
of gallons of water trapped behind it. Just one missile, he thinks, could
unleash a storm of destruction unlike anything heÂ’s ever seen.
