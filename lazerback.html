    Lazerback's beast mode
is-- like all other Prime-universe Predacons-- a dragon, but it's not the
kind of dragon you typically think of-- this kind is wingless, with thick,
powerful legs and a relatively short (but thick) tail. His entire silouhette
makes him seem like a brute, particularly since his front legs are longer
than his back legs. In this mode, there are only a few minor robot mode
extras-- you can see just a TOUCH of his robot head in between the back
of his dragon head and the top of his back, though the bigger offender
here are his fairly obvious robot hands that poke out of his lower front
legs a bit. Otherwise, he looks pretty darned flawless in this mode, with
great proportions that evoke the slightly stylized look of the Prime aesthetic.
His mold detailing is largely ornamental and/or dealing with armor plating
here, so he's not super-detailed anywhere, but it fits quite well. I especially
love all the spikes on his back and knees, the axe-like ending to his tail,
and the fins behind his dragon head, which help to give him a bit more
of a "wild" look. His dragon headsculpt also looks wild, with wicked-looking
teeth and a snout that looks halfway between a reptile and a bird. Lazerback's
color scheme of red, yellow, and black is a bit basic but works, with the
yellow particularly helping to contrast against the red and black while
"tying in" the pale purple thematically to the color scheme in a way where
without said yellow, the purple would've been a bit at odds with the other
colors. There's also a bit of gold detailing along the lines of his chest
and lower legs, and helps give a bit of a "royal" feel to him that most
Prime Predacons have. Lazerback's action feature in this mode is pretty
darned cool-- you can move his back up and forward a bit, revealing a spring-loaded
missile launcher that will fire a double-tipped missile, giving him some
firepower in this mode. For articulation, Lazerback can move slightly up-and-down
at the neck, at the jaw, rotation at the three headfins on each side (all
three fins are one piece), and at the shoulders on all four feet, the front
knees (at two places), the back knees (at three places), at the ankles
on the front feet, and at the ankles on the back feet (at two places).
I wish his tail could move a bit (it's made of that rubbery type of plastic),
but otherwise he's about as articulated as you could reasonably expect
here.

    Lazerback's robot mode
transformation is mostly straightforward, consisting of a "stand up and
flip around a few parts" transformation-- that said, there's a couple of
cool bits, like how his beast head "sinks in" to his robot chest with only
the top of it showing. This mode was definitely secondary in consideration
compared to his dragon mode (as is the case with nearly all of the Prime
Predacons), but it still looks pretty nice for the most part. It retains
the tough, somewhat stocky proportions from the dragon mode, with the arms
and thick chest and abdomen looking particularly impressive, especially
in terms of all the paint on the latter, which again helps with his "royal"
look a bit. His hands, however, are a bit of a weak point, with VERY obvious
dragon feet just sticking out behind then and ruining part of what is otherwise
a sleek silouhette. His legs-- being the rear dragon legs-- also suffer
from being way too skinny and oddly articulated below the knees-- I wish
they could straighten out a bit more. My biggest beef with this mode, though,
is definitely his head and neck. It's a bit overly fiddly and doesn't look
natural in pretty much any position, with his head sitting a tad too far
above the chest and the dragon head fins looking pretty weird coming off
the sides of his robot head. (That said, his robot head sculpt is excellent--
fairly wide and mean-looking like the rest of him, with pronounced teeth
and a mean face that brings together most of the elements of his color
scheme in a nice-looking, fairly organic package.) Lazerback's back missile
launcher can come off in this mode and be held in one of his hands like
you'd expect, but most of his tail can ALSO come off and form a sort of
"whip" weapon for him to hold, though unfortunately, it's a bit too short,
thick, and unarticulated to really pass as a whip-- it just looks like
he's holding his tail. For articulation in this mode, Lazerback has the
same movement on his arms and legs that he had in beast mode, plus movement
at the robot neck, movement halfway down his lower arms (due to his transformation),
and rotation at the wrists. Because of the odd way his lower arms transform,
he's a bit stiff-looking there, and I wish he did have waist rotation,
but given the transformation that doesn't really seem all that possible.
He's pretty well-balanced, so you can get a pretty decent number of poses
out of him.

    Lazerback is about middle-of-the-road
as far as Prime Predacons go. His dragon mode is fantastic-looking, with
only a few minor extras, and I do like how his chest transforms and his
general sculpting, but a couple of oddities like odd robot head placement,
a weak tail-weapon, modes that generally look too similar, and odd lower
arms keep this mold from being among the cream of the Predacon crop.

       Even as he floated helpless in the darkness
of the Hyperevolution Chamber, Lazerback could hear what happened around
him. He heard much of what Shockwave said in his strange voice, and he
knew before he emerged what his plan would be. Now, freed from the chamber,
he is no longer interested in what the Decepticon scientist who cloned
him has to say. Lazerback refuses to serve under anyone, not an overlord
like Megatron, or a conqueror like Predaking. Instead, he is determined
to see chaos reign. Stealing a tracking device from the lab, he blasts
off hoping to see chaos made king by the destruction of two tyrants who
stand in his way.
