    Predaking is the only
2014 Beast Hunters mold that isn't a redeco or a "blown up" version of
an earlier mold; he's a completely new toy. That said, his overall transformation
scheme is based on the
    <a href="pricypredaking.html">
     commander-class version
    </a>
    of him, so he's still not
    <i>
     completely
    </i>
    original. What someone will
notice when they first lay eyes on this new "simplified" voyager Predaking
is that he is HUGE for a voyager; particularly in dragon mode, he could
pass as a modern Leader-class toy. He's larger than any other Predaking
toy except for the
    <a href="pribfpredaking.html">
     "Beast Fire" version
    </a>
    ,
and even then he's not smaller by much. As far as proportions go, in dragon
mode he's largely solid; thankfully he doesn't take his commandder-class
version's dragon mode proportions, as he has well-scaled legs, a nice long
tail (even if it's waaay too obvious that it's a blade in robot mode),
a nicely proportioned neck, and a very accurate dragon headsculpt. His
wings are a little on the small side, but this is only in comparison to
how huge they are on most other Predaking toys; they still aren't an eyesore,
that's for sure. The only real proportional malady here comes from the
fact that he shares his transformation with his commander-class version,
and this the lower robot legs form the main body of the dragon mode; this
makes his body look overly wide from a top-down angle, and he could have
used just a TOUCH more of a belly to help "beef out" his proportions a
bit more. There's also a few robot mode extras; specifically, the robot
hands on the back of the front claws and the obvious feet on the top of
the main body. His back end is also a bit hollow, though the tail attachment
back there helps to cover up that some. As far as mold detailing goes,
he fits in very much with the Prime aesthetic, with large spaces of relatively
little, slightly stylized detailing that looks a tad royal (like with most
other Predacons), though he has some parts that are quite intricately detailed,
such as his head and neck, shoulders, and hand/claws. He's also got Cybertronian
runes all over his body, though they aren't painted, unfortunately. Predaking's
overall color scheme is more or less the same as it is on the show, but
much of the black has been replaced with a semi-translucent, smoky dark
plastic instead, with some excellent-looking dark gunmetal gray on such
places as his neck and head. His wings are also a translucent orange this
time around, and some of his orange plastic-- such as on the underside
of his neck and on his robot chest-- is a more pale, lighter version of
orange than seen on most of his other toys. I'm a bit conflicted on this--
I like the larger color variety on one hand and such things as the partially
painted wings and tail, but having more of his body be black would've helped
with the visual interest and contrast more, and I'm just not a fan of the
fact that so much of the plastic on his body is translucent-- it doesn't
look right. Since emphasis was made this time around on the size and simpler
transformation, Predaking's articulation is a bit more limited this time
around-- he can move up-and-down at the base of the skull, at two points
on each wing, at two points at his front shoulders, two points at his front
knees, slightly at one point on each of the front ankles, at the base of
the tail, and at two points at the rear leg shoulders. This is serviceable,
but I really wish he had some basic points like jaw, rear knee, and more
extensive neck articulation.

    Predaking's robot mode
is a bit lankier than his show model-- being taller proportionally and
not quite as wide as he should be-- but otherwise, in terms of detailing
this is the most accurate sculpt Predaking has, with a spot-on sculpt for
the shoulders, chest, face and the like (though this is partially lessened
by his inaccurate color pallet in this mode-- darn you, translucent plastic)!.
Despite being a little too lanky, otherwise he's looking very good in this
mode, with the only real kibble being the dragon head and neck, which hangs
comfortably behind his back and out of the way. His front dragon claws
are visible on his lower arms behind his hands, but they're not particularly
an eyesore, and his rear dragon legs do a good job with helping his stability
by acting as heels for his rather hollow lower legs in this mode (though
having them at a 90-degree angle to the robot legs and not able to fold
in all the way into the lower legs does make them look a bit odd). Unlike
his dragon mode, here Predaking has all your major articulation points
covered; he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at
two points), hips (at two points), knees (at two points), slightly at one
point on each of the ankles, and again at the same two points on each wing.
Because his wings are smaller proportionally than usual on this toy-- and
because he has rather large feet-- he can stand up by himself quite easily,
with some nice stability that's enhanced by thick ratching joints at load-bearing
parts like his knees. As is obvious, his dragon tail comes off and forms
an absurdly oversized sword in this mode; he also has a gray push-missile
launcher which can either fit into one of his hands or in a port on the
back of his sword.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The 2014 version of
voyager Predaking is my favorite mold of the character, with generally
great proportions in each mode (even if his robot mode is a tad too lanky),
the most show-accurate sculpt of the character, a HUGE size (and thus value)
for the price point, and few kibble issues in either mode. Sure his transformation
may be a bit too simple for the size-- and I really wish he didn't have
transparent plastic on anything but his wings-- but overall, this is the
Predaking you want if you're looking for a sturdy large one.
