    This isn't a new, updated
version of
    <a href="trblurr.html">
     G1 Blurr
    </a>
    , but rather an updated version
of
    <i>
     Rescue Bots
    </i>
    Blurr, as that show takes place within the same continuity
as Robots in Disguise. Anyways, the two share similar color schemes, but
Rescue Bots Blurr has more of a futuristic F1 race car alt mode, as opposed
to just a futuristic... sled... thing... that G1 Blurr usually is. Anyways,
in alt mode Blurr looks pretty good, with generally solid proportions.
The only real issue in this respect with Blurr is that his cockpit is too
small; especially when compared to his Warrior class version, it's just
way too tiny, even if it DOES have to be this way for the transformation
to work. There are also some minor visible robot bits in this mode-- I
wouldn't call them "kibble" as they don't hang off the mode or are really
blatantly obvious, but they ARE there. The robot waist and sides of the
upper legs are visible on front of the cockpit, along with the kneecaps
on the front pieces to the sides of the cockpit. The robot feet are also
visible on the front ends. Still, all of these are pretty minor, and can
be seen as just general details on the mode. There is a bit of a "hole"
in the middle of the back end, where the slider is used for transformation,
but that's another minor issue, as you can't see through it all the way
unless looking at it from directly above. The mold detailing for this mode,
as you'd expect for a RID2015 toy, is fairly basic, but even moreso than
on your average toy in the line, given that he's also a speedy race car.
Beyond some simple angular details on the headlights and wheel hubs, everything
else is pretty barebones. The color scheme is different from his Rescue
Bots version in that it's not purple, but rather close to G1 Blurr's, with
a somewhat dark, aquamarine-ish blue forming the main color and mainly
playing off the darker, flat navy blue color used for the wheels, spoiler,
and some minor details. There's two versions of the dark navy blue; a flatter
version used for the plastic on the wheels and slider, and a more metallic
version used on the spoiler and some of the robot details. Regardless,
it's a good scheme, even though I think the aquamarine-ish shade could've
been a bit lighter for better contrast. The light blue paint on the headlights
and cockpit windows does accomplish this somewhat, but there needed to
be mroe of it. There's also some white on the robot waist and feet visible
in this mode, which offers another light color to add to the mix-- all
in all, it's a nice, varied scheme. On the top of his roof, there's a port
for you to plug in a Mini-Con Weaponizer or weapon with a similar-sized
peg to give Blurr some firepower.

    To transform Blurr,
simply slide up the middle section of the toy, and the rest auto-transforms
(except for the feet, which you have to manually flip out). The end result
is generally good, though it's the weaker of Blurr's two modes. The head
is just a titch small, but otherwise alright, taking the Rodimus-like dome
and large eyes of Rescue Bots Blurr and "RID-izing" them a bit. He's also
got a nice mischevious smirk on his face. His chest is the alt mode roof
and windows, and looks pretty good, no complaints there. The upper legs
are rather weak, as they're supposed to be formed by two diagonal parts
that "come together" from the midsection and the front section of the vehicle
mode-- except they don't actually come together, there's a very noticeable
gap there. The lower legs look great, though, and are fairly proportional,
and his feet keep him pretty stable. His arms are the weakest part, as
his shoulders are just molded into the back portions of his vehicle mode
(though having the spoiler bits on them is accurate to the show), and lower
arms are molded into blocks of plastic and don't really look good (though
he can handle weapons in his hands in this mode). For articulation, Blurr
can only move forward at the shoulders-- as with other 1-step changers,
articulation is not the point of these toys. For added paint, there's a
good amount of white on the shoulders, and the head is very well-painted,
with light blue on the eyes and stripes diagonally on the head, as well
as white on the face and the vent in the center of his forehead. Other
than that, the other paint apps are carried over from vehicle mode-- but
both modes still share enough that Blurr is still nice and varied. One
last surprising thing about this mode is that, though Blurr's overall mold
detailing is pretty basic, on the back side there's some surprisingly intricate
little vents, circuitry, and the like all molded in-- odd that all the
cool little details are on places you CAN'T easily see in either mode...

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The 1-step changer version
of RID2015 Blurr may not be up to the standards of somewhat who wants an
articulated toy that's well-proportioned in both modes, but for a 1-step
he's pretty good. He does have some kibble/proportional issues in robot
mode, as well as a cockpit that's way too small, but his transformation
accomplishes quite a lot in one motion and his vehicle mode is generally
very solid, as is his color scheme break-up. A great choice for a kid who's
moved on from Rescue Bots, but isn't quite ready for multi-step TFs yet.
