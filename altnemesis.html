    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Optimus Prime.

     Nemesis Prime is the
first exclusive Alternator of any sort, and Hasbro vastly underestimated
the demand for him-- thus, although his "official" price is a fairly reasonable
$25 U.S., consider yourself very lucky if you snagged him for that. Usually
he goes for $40-60 on eBay. Anyways, Nemesis Prime follows the tradition
of previous evil Primes and has black for a main color, with dark gray,
red, and teal for secondary colors. It's a very good color scheme, if a
bit cliche, so it fits very well on this toy. The transparent red windows
are a tad tacky, however, seeing as how the whole point of Alternators
is the realism in vehicle mode. The red eyes and silver faceplate on the
robot head look very nice, and exceedingly eeevil. The teal highlights
on the arms and legs also contrast very nicely with the black, and I love
the particularly metallic shade of the color that's going on with this
toy. I do have to say, though, that with the exception of the lower legs
and lower arms, it Nemesis Prime is just black, black, and more black.
He does have some dark gray, but it's pretty minimal and in places that
are easily hidden in both modes. A larger proportion of gray, or at least
some more teal paint apps, would have worked wonders to make Nemesis Prime's
color scheme more varied. As it is, he does look a little duller than he
otherwise would have.

     Alternator Nemesis Prime
is a decent repaint of Optimus with a nice color scheme, but he really
could've used more teal or gray to break up so much black. Add that to
the fact that it's the worst Alternator mold so far and that it likely
will cost you significantly more than the average Alternator, and I can't
recommend this guy for any but the hardcore Alternator completist.
