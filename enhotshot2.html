    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Energon Hot
Shot toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Energon Hot Shot toy

     The upgraded version
of Hot Shot in Japan has the suffix "fire" added to his name, and it's
certainly appropriate. "Energon" Energon Hot Shot definitely plays up to
HOT Shot. In vehicle mode, he's got some light red flame decos going across
the top of his otherwise silver body, and he's got some transparent orange-red
windows and headlights too. Overall, it's a VERY nice looking alternate
mode, and immediately catches the eye. In robot mode, however, the color
schemes becomes more of a rather loud red and orange-yellow. Many Transfans
have made the comparison between this robot mode and Ronald McDonald, and
it's really not that far-fetched. The colors don't outright clash, but
they are a bit too bright. If only Hasbro had toned down those two colors
a few more shades, I think this mode would've really looked great while
still being fiery. The bluish black also would have looked a bit better
as just plain black, but that's a rather minor complaint.

     "Energon" Energon Hot
Shot is a decent elemental-themed redeco, but the red and yellow need to
be toned down just a bit. If only that had been the case, this version
would have been better than the original Energon Hot Shot, but as it is,
it comes slightly below the previous version. It's still a pretty good
paint job overall, though, especially in vehicle mode.

       Energon Hot Shot's enhanced physical
state has made him faster and tougher than ever. Before his physical upgrade,
Hot Shot was dependent primarily on his speed and tactical abilities during
battle. His energon-enhanced body has now given him the strength and endurance
required when facing off against some of Megatron's larger warriors such
as Scorponok and Demolishor. In addition to being one of Optimus Prime's
most valuable soldiers, Energon Hot Shot continues to be a positive role
model to younger Autobot rookies such as Ironhide and Rodimus.
