    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Leader
class Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original RotF Leader class Optimus Prime toy

     The "core" Optimus Prime
toy for this exclusive is completely unchanged in terms of its colors and
paint apps from the original RotF Leader class Prime toy-- what you're
buying here is, in addition to this awesome but complex mold, some pretty
huge extra pieces, consisting of a quadruple-turbine jetpack and two enormous
cannons. Both can fit on Optimus in both modes, but they're primarily made
for the robot mode, where they're made to emulate Optimus Prime with his
"trailer backpack" on, like in this movie. Unfortunately these extra pieces
can't form a trailer for vehicle mode, and thus look out-of-place and overly
large in vehicle mode, but still in an oddly cool way. Each of Optimus'
four wings-- which have white and blue stripes on them emulating his "classic"
trailer paint apps, a nice touch-- can move up and down (or back and forth
if you're talking about vehicle mode). His oversized cannons can be held
solidly either attached to his turbines or to his robot mode fists. They're
really cool, ridiculously large weapons, but don't fire missiles or have
electronics, in case you're wondering. The gold-to-red fade on the main
body of the cannons looks quite nice and fits in well thematically with
his vehicle mode nose. The "charged up" feel of the electric blue used
on the interior parts of the cannons also gives them a real "energetic"
feel, and the orange "red hot" fade on the tips of the cannons is another
nice touch that really makes Optimus look like he's in the middle of combat.
Finally, for his "normal" robot mode, he's got an additional cannon accessory
that's identical to that he used in
     <i>
      Revenge of the Fallen
     </i>
     . Of additional
note is that a few minor mold changes have been made to the "core" Optimus
figure, such as clips to help attach his cannons and backpack. His flip-out
swords from his arms have also been removed because they'd get in the way--
which is fine by me, I thought they were mildly annoying accessories anyway
when they weren't flipped out.

     If you don't have the
original RotF Leader version of Optimus Prime and don't mind complex transformations,
this is absolutely a must-buy of a toy, given that it does a pretty good
job of emulating Prime's jetpack from DotM in robot mode without messing
with his proportions and articulation like the
     <a href="dotmultprime.html">
      "Ultimate"
version
     </a>
     does. (The price of this, though, is no vehicle mode trailer.)
In my mind, this is the definitive version of movieverse Optimus (at least
that you don't have to import)-- an awesome, accurate toy with great, huge
accessories. If you already have the RotF Leader Prime, though, despite
how awesome it is I'd only recommend picking up this mold again if you're
a completist, given the price and how the main toy is 99% identical to
the original.

       Jetwing Optimus Prime is a master strategist,

by his human allies after the last great battle with the Decepticons. With
the increased mobility and overwhelming firepower it supplies, he's ready
