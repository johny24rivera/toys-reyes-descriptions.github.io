    Wolverine's vehicle mode
is an offroad vehicle-- a pretty good fit for his rough personality. Heck,
even the front windows look like they're "scowling", which I LOVE. He's
also completely robot extra-free in this mode, which is always good. The
color scheme is the classic "blue and yellow" color scheme for Wolvie,
though the amounts of blue and yellow have been switched to make for a
better-looking vehicle mode. The black and dull gray secondary colors serve
as good secondary colors, and he's got his fair share of paint detailing,
so no complaints there. (The yellow stripes on the sides don't quite line
up, though, for some reason.) The proportions are pretty good, though Wolverine's
alternate mode is oddly lacking in mold detailing, which makes it look
a bit more cartoony than it should. All of the pieces lock together remarkably
solidly into place in this mode, though getting them all into just the
right place when transforming Wolverine back from robot mode can be rather
tricky. One noticeable flaw is that he is lacking a bit of a back end to
this mode, though, with no such things as a exhaust pipe or rear bumper
visible.

    Wolverine's robot mode
is pretty good, though it does have some problems I'll get to right off
the bat. Firstly, his arms are a bit skinny for a buff dude like Wolverine.
I also don't like his head sculpt, the coil used for a super-big chin just
looks goofy. His shoulders are also just... jointed rather oddly, so very
few poses you can put his arms in look natural. (He's also got some blatant
kibble pieces on his upper arms and behind his arms.) The vehicle parts
on his shoulders and chest actually complement the mode, though, as they
beef up their respective sections of the figure. (I was surprised to find
that the wheels on the sides of his midsection actually collapse inwards
a bit during transformation-- something that totally wasn't necessary,
but makes the robot mode look better.) The kibble behind his back doesn't
really add anything, but tucks up well and stays out of the way, so I don't
mind it. The legs look fairly good overall, but the way the knee ratcheting
joint is set up, you basically have to either have Wolverine leaning backwards
(which isn't the most stable, even with his wide feet), or you have to
bend his legs in upon themselves a little to get him to stand straight,
which looks rather odd. Otherwise his articulation is good, though-- he
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at three points),
waist, hips (at two points), and his aforementioned knees can move at two
points. Wolverine's gimmick has to do with his classic "SNIKT" pop-out
claws-- press small buttons on the tops of his forearms to have them pop
out on each arm.

    TF Crossovers Wolverine
is roughly average, maybe slightly above-average as Marvel Transformers
go. His vehicle mode is his shining point, though his robot mode also has
some pretty good features about it. His main drawbacks are his odd points
of articulation at his knees and shoulders, plus a few rather obviously
pieces of kibble. Overall, I'd recommend him, unless you particularly despise
the character.

      Built to match the toughness and ferocity
of Wolverine himself, this battle suit is fast, scrappy, and able to take
a pounding that would turn other mechs into scrap. Advanced repair systems
fix most damage done almost instantly. In addition, the mech mode pops
out claws sharp enough to rip through almost any armor.
