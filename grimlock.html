    Beast mode is a velociraptor.
The dalmatian-like coloring in this mode is very odd and the original paint,
    <a href="dinobot.html">
     Dinobot
    </a>
    , is colored better. This mode is also
a little bulky, and its robot legs show clearly on his beast chest. However,
this beast mode is nicely detailed and can easily stand up.

    Robot mode is very nice,
with few extras. The only extras ae his small velociraptor legs and butt
on his back. His tail can open up and spin to reveal a sort of spinning
shield slicer. A sword comes out of his tail and can be put in his other
arm. His legs have a little bit of a bone look to them, which is a nice
touch. His dino face sticks out a little bit too much, though, although
it doesnt get in the way much. He has a mask and a regular face, but his
two parts of his mask dont stay together well. The mask also can't separate
all the way to completely reveal the robot head, which is a drag.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    A very nice repaint,
but, in my opinion, Dinobot is slightly better.

      In another era when wars were waged
between Autobots and Decepticons, Grimlock was a stalwart defender of the
heroic Autobot cause. Today, disguised as a vicious velociraptor, Grimlock
continues to battle against interstellar tyranny as he fights the evil
Predacons. After converting to robot mode, his spinning slasher sword -
hidden within his tail - slices through the Predacon legions. And when
the attack is over, you can usually find him flossing his fangs with the
internal wiring of his battle-beaten enemies.
