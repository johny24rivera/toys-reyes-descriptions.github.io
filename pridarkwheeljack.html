not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime deluxe

     "Dark Energon" Wheeljack's
color scheme is an homage to Slicer, a European late-G1 toy that was a
redeco of G1 "Action Master" Wheeljack. Like Slicer, this version of Wheeljack's
main color is blue, with some black (and some dark "dirty" gray) being
the main secondary colors. In keeping with the whole "Dark Energon" theme,
though, Wheeljack's blue is almost all transparent, and it looks good,
particularly in vehicle mode where you can see all the little bits of detailing
on both sides of the transparent parts. The blue itself is a pretty close
match to Slicer's in terms of general hue. There's also just a touch of
metallic blue on the roof of Wheeljack's robot mode-- by itself, the color
looks great, but used in such a small section right next to transparent
blue plastic makes it look a bit "off", as it's a bit of a lighter hue
but not quite enough to provide contrast-- it sticks out in a generally
bad way, in other words. The charcoal gray/black is a nice neutral to play
off of, but it doesn't really contrast enough from the dark transparent
blue to really make itself an all-that-great addition to the color scheme.
What ARE appreciated additions are the paint apps that are more relegated
to "accent" status on this toy-- namely, the red and metallic copper, which
were also used on Slicer. The red on Wheeljack's front and upper legs is
a nice light shade of the color that contrasts excellently with the blue,
while the transparent red used for Wheeljack's windows really helps to
give the red a bit more of a "voice" in vehicle mode-- having two transparent
colors that are "opposites" on a toy rarely looks anything but good, in
my opinion. The metallic copper is only used on Wheeljack's swords, lower
arms, and head, but it looks fantastic against the charcoal gray and black,
and I wish it had been used more compared to the gray/black or even the
blue. He also has spiffy yellow-and-red "Autobot shield" symbols on the
sides of his car mode, which identify him as a "Dark Energon Defender".

     "Dark Energon Defender"
Wheeljack is a nice toy for those who A. Like obscure homages, B. Like
transparent plastic, or B. Just can't get enough of Wheeljack. For an exclusive,
he goes for quite a decent price--not really above that of your average
deluxe--and given how good the mold is, if you fit into one of the above
three categories, this is a definite purchase. When it comes to which version
of this mold is my favorite, though,
     <a href="prideadend.html">
      Dead End
     </a>
     still slightly edges out this one.

       Wheeljack is used to missions where
the chance of survival is near zero, but this is the toughest assignment
he's ever faced. Dark Energon is a threat that promises to test the tough
Autobot warrior to his very limits.
