     Ricochet is a black stealth
jet with a wicked-looking lighting-like paint app running down the top
of the jet (or on his chest and back if he's in robot mode)-- it looks
VERY Decepticon-ish. Unfortunately, he's an Autobot. Ah, well, it still
looks really cool, and he's one of the few Botcon 2005 toys to sport some
brand-new paint apps, especially one so large and prominent on his chassis.
I do wish that he had more paint apps than just that one that were readily
visible in his plane mode, however, since it still looks rather undetailed
even with the lightning paint apps-- this probably has to do with the fact
that almost all of his plastic parts are black. Granted, black is a cool
color on a transformer, but it needs another main or secondary color to
contrast with it-- making Ricochet's wings or his upper arms and legs in
robot mode into, say, red would have really done wonders and made him look
cooler. He's got several nifty paint apps in his robot mode, though-- the
silve ron his face, hands, and feet looks really well-done, and is a great
shade against the black. The blue used for his missiles and the transparent
blue used for his cockpit and face light-piping are also great contrasting
colors as well- I just wish there was more of said contrast.

     No mold changes have
been made to Ricochet from his predecessor, Universe Wind Sheer, though
Ricochet's joints seem decidedly tighter than my Wind Sheer's, which is
a good thing.

     Ricochet is a pretty
good exclusive, with some really nice paint apps-- he'd be perfect if only
he had another primary or secondary color to help contrast against all
that black a little more.

       Ricochet was one of the top trainees
in the espionage division of the Autobot academy. His skill in sabotage
gained the attention of Espionage Director Bumblebee, who took the young
Autobot under his wing. Unfortunately, this had the negative affect of
bolstering Ricochet's ego to an extreme. He thinks very highly of himself.
However, his abilities often justify his belief. Unfortunately, his attitude
has led to conflict with fellow Autobots from time to time. While he is
an adept spy, Ricochet prefers sabotage, which he feels is a much more
effective way of fighting enemies than outright battlefield confrontations.
"He'll grow and learn...if he survives long enough," Bumblebee says with
confidence.

       Abilities: In vehicle mode, Ricochet
has a top speed of mach 2.0. His primary weapon is his lance, mounted on
the top, able to fire bursts of plasma energy. His outer skin is composed
of a special alloy that is able to avoid most advanced detection methods.
Combined with his almost silent running engines, he can go undetected in
enemy territory with ease. In robot mode, Ricochet is extremely agile.
Has a massive array of visual and listening equipment built into his head
unit. In addition, his lance doubles as a melee weapon.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Weakness: Ricochet's attitude sometimes
leaves him in situations where he has taken on more than he can handle.
While other Autobots will come to his rescue, they have been known to do
so grudgingly.
