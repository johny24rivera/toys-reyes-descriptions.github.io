    It's been a while, but
Hasbro finally has released a "modernized" Sharkticon toy, complete with
the goofy little arms and legs-- it's pretty much straight-up the G1 design
with modern detailing and paint. In this mode, Gnaw looks kinda goofy with
his teeny t-rex-like arms, huge shark maw and face, relatively short body,
little spike-ball tail, and relatively short legs. Because of the sheer
"made-up-ness" of this mode, it's kinda difficult to judge it from a proportions
perspective. You either like the design or you don't, but it is pretty
accurate to the source material. The only extras in this mode are the robot
fists on the back end of the feet-- they're pretty obvious, but on the
other hand they do widen the feet and make the toy more stable since it's
front-heavy in this mode. The mold detailing is a little on the smooth
side, with some slight "armored" detailing on the main body, along with
some rotation points, hinges, and some basic shape details here and there.
The odd bits out are the arms, which have oddly organic detailing on them
that doesn't quite mesh with the rest of the toy. The color scheme is mostly
a light and a medium gray, but other than portions of the back it's broken
up pretty well. There's a nice light pale blue on the fin, arms, tail,
upper legs, and some other minor parts that contrasts decently with the
darker gray (not so much with the lighter gray) and of course fits in with
the whole "shark" theme. There's also a purple "mustache" on the face,
which at first looks sorta weird, but it does create a nice "upper lip"
on the toy and helps diversify the color scheme more. There's also some
pink on the lower lip, confirming that yes, this color scheme was initially
created in the mid-to-late '80s. My favorite part color-wise, though, has
got to be the eyes. They could've just been painted on, but the transparent
light green bulbous circles firmly ensconced in those gray eye sockets
just looks GREAT and gives them that "glass" feeling they had in the animated
movie. For articulation in this mode, Gnaw can move at the hips, knees,
shoulders, and up-and-down at the jaw. (Unfortunately, the tail is fixed
in place.) Since Gnaw is part of Titans Return, he does have two pegs for
a Titan Master-- on the bottom of the inner lower lip of his mouth! Heh
heh, time to get crunched, Titan Masters...

    To transform Gnaw to
robot mode, you essentially fold down and back the entire upper half of
the Sharkticon mode, fold the upper jaw sections back behind the legs,
and then fold down the lower jaw and fold the legs up onto the sides to
become legs. Given that most of this mode is visible either on the beast
mode's back or underbelly or not at all, for a fairly simple transformation
it gets a lot done-- Gnaw is a squat, circular little guy, and if it wasn't
for the teeth on the top of his chest and some of his kibble it'd be hard
to tell it was the same 'bot. As for said kibble, the most egregious are
the mouth halves and shark arms on the backside of the legs. The arms in
particular really stick out, and it partially ruins the look of the legs
for me. The shark fin sticks out behind Gnaw's back, but it doesn't get
in the way and isn't overly blatant, so I don't mind it much. The lower
arms also have obvious feet on the back of them, in a reverse of the Sharkticon
mode kibble. The arms themselves have very obvious ball joints that aren't
quite "closed up" enough, which I'm not that big on, though it's not a
huge downside. Overall Gnaw certainly has unique proportions, with a wide
circular body, short legs, and big fists, but like with the shark mode,
this is accurate to the source material (in fact, they slimmed him down
a bit). So again, you either like it or you don't. Gnaw's head is a supremely
well-done sculpt, complete with the little circular details on the sides
of his helmet, a chubby light gray face with red eyes, and a "stunted"
mohawk. There's even little faux teeth behind his head, which is a nice
extra touch. The extra pink and purple details on the main body and legs
help break up the gray even more, and the whole color scheme looks quite
good in that slightly-loud late-'80s feel. Gnaw can hold his tail-mace
in either of his fist holes, though given the way the weapon's molded he
holds it at a bit of an odd angle. For articulation in this mode, Gnaw
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, hips, and knees.
His legs could stand to be slightly more articulated, but otherwise he's
pretty good in this respect, especially given his proportions.

    Gnaw is definitely one
of the most unique Transformers out there, with a wildly alien robotic
walking shark mode and a chubby, short robot mode-- he's both sharp and
curvy at the same time. I like his shark mode proportions a fair bit more
than his robot mode, but your mileage may vary, of course. There's some
pretty obvious kibble behind his legs in robot mode, but other than that
how much you like this figure depends on how much you liked the Sharkticon
design to begin with. If you think it looks goofy, this won't change your
mind, but if you like it, here it is, and at a pricepoint that encourages
troop building too, if you're into that.
