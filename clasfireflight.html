not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Jetfire.

     According to Aaron Archer,
one of the lead Transformers designers, Fireflight was meant to be named
Powerglide-- after its definite homage to the G1 character of the same
name-- but unfortunately they weren't able to get the copyright. Still,
Aaron begged us to call him Powerglide, so in accordance with Master Transformer
Designer's wishes, Fireflight is now Powerglide. Voila!

     Classics POWERGLIDE
is a great homage to G1 Powerglide, with a similar alternate mode and a
color scheme that is pretty much spot-on accurate when compared to the
original toy. The dark dull red works very well for a plane, and the light
tan serves as a nice contrast to the other darker colors. I rather wish
another lighter color had been used with the black as a nice accent color,
though, because the black doesn't really contrast well against the dull
red. Maybe using more of the silver only used for the cockpit windows would
have worked better. The use of LoC Jetfire's head for Powerglide is also
an ingenious reuse of the mold especially well, since his face is rather
similar to G1 Powerglide's but without the dopey conehead. Still, as I
said before, more use of the silver on the faceplate area would've been
more appropriate than the tan, seeing as how the original Powerglide had
a silver face.

     No mold changes have
been made to Classics Powerglide.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Classics Powerglide
is an excellent repaint homage and an ingenious use of an existing mold.
I would've preferred another brighter accent color in addition to the black,
but otherwise it's a mighty fine color scheme that slightly surpasses LoC
Jetfire's, in my opinion.
