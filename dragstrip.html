    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Mirage. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Mirage

     Drag Strip here is a
redeco/homage to the G1 Stunticon of the same name, and is also a yellow
race car to boot. In race car mode, Drag Strip looks rather plain when
compared to the other paint jobs this mold has gotten-- too much of it
is yellow (though at least it's a dull yellow), and most of the other colors
in this mode are either hidden on the underside or, in the case of the
paint apps, used mostly on the sides and ends of the figure. They're nice
paint apps-- the light red works fairly well with the yellow, and the black
and pale metallic bronze particularly so-- but this makes the main body
of the car a big patch of dull yellow, which is hardly eye-catching. In
robot mode the black helps to break things up a a bit more, though the
color scheme still isn't as good as the other paint jobs this mold has
had, in my opinion (since I'm not a big fan of yellow). The purple/light
blue face is rather odd-looking, but it the two colors to contrast well
against each other and are very "Decepticon-y".

     Universe 2.0 Drag Strip
is a decent homage to the G1 character, but his fairly dull color scheme,
combined with his jacked-up price due to his exclusive nature, has me recommending
him less than Mirage or

try to pick those two up before you consider this guy.

       The only thing Decepticon Drag Strip
hates more than the Autobots is coming in second. He hates losing so much,
he'll do anything to avoid it. Cheating is always his first resort, followed
by outright violence against his competition. The other Decepticons wouldn't
be at all sad to see him scrapped, since he's almost as much of a pain
for them to deal with as he is for the enemy.
