    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
jet. This mode is VERY cool-looking. The yellow stripes and spots, combined
with the blue "background" and sometimes the red-orange fade, fits together
very well. It is also very show-accurate, only a few small differences
differentiating this mode from the show version. This is also one HUGE
ultra-sized toy- Hasbro could have probably made it a super if they wanted
to. Jetstorm also has a very cool action gimmick in this mode. If you unhook
a hinge on the jet rear, his missile pods spring up. By turning the missle
pods left and right, not only to the missiles fire, but his jet-head also
moves in the appropriate direction and his missles and eyes light up as
well! Very cool! This looks especially great in the dark! The jet head
can also move without the action feature deployed, so don't worry there.
The only problem with this action gimmick is that in certain toys, the
hinge on the rear may get worn down over time, and the missle pods may
spring up occasionally when you don't want them to. Still, a rather well-done
and creative gimmick. There are two problems with this mode, however, one
major and one minor. The major one is that the robot legs rather hang off
the bottom, and from a side view, look a little odd. They still fit in
somewhat, though, and aren't TOO much of a distraction. The minor problem
is that there are two small openings in the back aft of the jet, and it
keeps the main body of the jet from looking "solid". This doesn't really
interfere with playability, though. Jetstorm also comes with two "guided
missile-drones", which are essentially shark-faced torpedos that can move
their necks. A missle with posability? Now THAT'S original. They are stored
on his underside in this mode. One other note that's common to all forms
of Jetstorm: for some reason, the "transmetallized" plastic on Ultra Jetstorm
seems a bit cheaper than that on other transformers, and it tends to chip
and peel by itself after a year or so of playing. This can detract from
the visual effect, but, of course, it doesn't hinder playability. Detailing
in this mode is pretty good for a vehicle- although rather smooth,Â 
it does have chips and electronic gadgetry molded in in some places- the
detailing isn't as good as that of

    . Jetstorm's spark crystal can be viewed rather easily; merely
lift up the small grey panel at the front of his main body and there it
is.

    Although Ultra Jetstorm's
robot mode isn't as good as his vehicle mode, it's still rather nice, especially
from a front-on view. Again, it's stunning visually. His arms, however,
are too small proportionally, and the tabs that are supposed to hold them
into the main body don't do so very well, so his arms may come out of their
sockets sometimes when you try to move them. As noticeable from a side
or back view, his main body also isn't filled out- the back is mostly hollow,
and detracts a bit from the visual effect unless you look at him straight-on.
Jetstorm's eyes and missile pods (now chest-mounted) can light up in this
mode, too, by pressing a button under Jetstorm's head. The missiles must
be fired separately by triggers in this mode. Two other concerns with this
mode: For one, the plastic for the chest panels feels rather cheap when
you're transforming him, almost like you're going to break them off. So
far, they have held well on my toy, though. Second, Jetstorm's chest sticks
out a bit too much, making him look unnecessarily bulky for this mode.
Still, though, Jetstorm is still a rather cool 'bot in this mode, if for
nothing else than posing. His claws can move individually, which is always
a treat, the style of his large legs and head almost make him look "Gundam-ish".
A pretty good mode, but it does have a few flaws that could have been corrected.
This is what kept me from giving Jetstorm a 9.0 or above.

    Jetstorm's hover mode
is merely an extension of his robot mode, with the feet transformed into
minature hover-engines. This hover mode is much better-looking than the
Deluxe Jetstorm's hover mode, and Ultra Jetstorm's lower body looks more
solid. Kudos to Hasbro on this mode.

    Overall, a great toy.
It does have a few flaws, especially in robot mode, but the positives far
outway the negatives, in my opinion. A recommended buy.

      A high-tech flying Vehicon, Jetstorm
is a fast-talking hotshot with a mean attitude and a twisted sense of humor.
Spends as much time taunting his opponents as blasting them. Loves his
job as General of the aerodrones and is fiercely competitive with his fellow
Vehicon Generals. Glowing eyes are equipped with powerful radar for scanning
and tracking Maximals. His pulse missile system is thought-guided and deadly
to the core. Quickest of the Vehicons, Jetstorm is despised by all who
know him.
