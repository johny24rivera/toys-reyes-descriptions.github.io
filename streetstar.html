not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Deluxe Prowl.

     Streetstar here is a
repaint homage to Street
     <i>
      wise
     </i>
     , and apparently had to be named due
to copyright conflicts. Streetstar/wise is a G1 character, but he had a
planned re-release in G2 under a paint scheme almost identical to this
toy's, though the re-release was ultimately cancelled. Thus, even though
Streetstar isn't really "G2", it helps him fit in with the whole "forgotten
generation" theme of this year's convention exclusives. For a G2 toy, Streetstar's
colors are surprisingly grounded-- red and black are his main colors, with
a bit of various shades of blue thrown in there to help mix up things a
little. The only color on him that could even vaguely be considered "loud"
would be the sky blue paint used for his rear windows, but I think that
really goes nicely with the black-- heck, I wish there were more of it.
Streetstar some pretty cool little nods to his cancelled G2 release, such
as the "95-4" number on his roof, the police/Autobot emblems on his car
doors, and the G2-era overly obvious "AUTOBOT" on his windshield. All are
great touches, as is the red and blue alternating "siren" details not only
on the relevant on vehicle mode, but also on his waist on robot mode, which
is a pretty nice unifying touch. The silver, where it's used, also works
quite well, but my main beef with Streetstar is that he looks WAY too similar
to the Universe 2.0 release of the mold as
     <a href="uni2silverstreak.html">
      Silverstreak
     </a>
     --
the placement of the red and black is pretty much identical between the
two toys, the only big differences being that Streetstar has a lot less
silver and a little more blue than Silverstreak. Also, though he has the
aforementioned cool little touches here and there, overall Streetstar is
oddly bereft of paint apps for a Botcon toy. His face, upper chest, and
arms in particular could really use some more paint detailing.

     Botcon 2010 Streetstar
is a pretty decent-looking Transformer by himself, but when you consider
his exclusivity and then compare how similar he is to the mass-release
Universe 2.0 Silverstreak, he's kind of a letdown. He also could use a
few more paint apps, and in general seems to be the "filler toy" for the
boxset. Still, if you want an exclusive from this year but don't want one
with a loud color scheme, this is one of your few options. Overall, though,
he's my least favorite of the Botcon 2010 exclusives.

       Nothing escapes his notice... and now
it is even more difficult for the Decepticons to notice him! Having been
exposed to forestonite, Streetstar has gained the ability to phase through
solid objects at will. Though not a Generation 2 Transformer by design,
he now feels more at home among the other G2 Autobots due to his new abilities.
Stationed at Autobot City, he, and the other forestonite enhanced Autobots
from the Prime era, fight alongside Spark and the rest of his next generation
comrades!
