    Hulk's entry in the "Flip
and Attack" subline is-- naturally-- a tank in vehicle mode. Kinda. They
gave it the prefix "smasher tank" so that it doesn't actually have to look
much like a tank beyond the treads, I guess. As with the other toys in
the "Flip and Attack" subline, the vehicle mode is considerably less recognizable
as a vehicle and more recognizable as the mech mode on its back with its
legs raised up in front of its chest. On the plus side, though, Hulk does
have a bit more mold detailing in vehicle mode when compared to most other
"Flip and Attack" figures, with little rivets, vents, and the like molded
in all over the place. There's also two large (non-firing) blue guns in
this mode to give ol' Hulkie some firepower. Unfortunately, the dull blue
paint on said guns is all that's really prominent outside of Hulk's rather
two-tone color scheme of dull green and an odd purplish brown color that's
meant to represent his "pants" in mech mode. There's a bit of black on
the treads as well, but all of Hulk's colors are on the dark and/or dull
side of the spectrum, with no bright colors to contrast against at all.
Even just making the green a little lighter or giving him white/yellow
headlights would've helped immensely, methinks.

    To transform Hulk, like
all of the "Flip and Attack" figures, you wind him back in his vehicle
mode on a flat surface until you hear a clicking sound on the wheels, then
let it go-- the legs will flip forward abruptly a couple seconds later,
the weight and torque of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Hulk
stand up into his mech mode on his own. It only seems to happen about 1/3
to 1/2 of the time in my experience, though-- the other times he just unfolds
and rockets forward a bit to clatter around on his front or backside. When
it does happen right, though, it's a pretty awesome little gimmick, and
one that's an homage to the Jumpstarters Topspin and Twin Twist from the
original Transformers toyline. Unfortunately, Hulk keeps all of the engineering
restrictions inherent in those early-'80s toys as well-- he can only move
back-and-forth at the shoulders, not even head or elbow movement on this
guy. The crotch also extends forward a bit far-- more noticeably on this
guy than on most of the other "Flip and Attack" toys, due to his chest
being (oddly enough, for the Hulk) not as forward-reaching. The riveted,
sculpted "abs" are done pretty well in a angular, mechanical fashion, and
the head is also sculpted into a mechanical version of Hulk's head pretty
nicely, not going too far into the "technorganic" direction. I don't like
the paint apps on the eyes, though-- they look too human. Kinda creepy.
His hands are a bit too hidden as well-- they're merely sculpted on the
inside of the side pieces like with other "Flip and Attack" toys, but they're
especially flat and easy to miss here, on a character where they should
be especially obvious.

    Hulk is one of the weaker
toys in the "Flip and Attack" subline of toys. He suffers from the same
"iffy vehicle mode" and "bad posability" that the other toys do, but he
adds to it an especially indecipherable vehicle mode and a color scheme
that's far too bland overall to attract the eye.
