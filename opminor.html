    Beast mode is a deformed
monkey. He looks basically all right, with no extras, but, since you fold
his monkey head back to reveal his robot head, his chin is a LOT smaller
than the rest of his head, so he looks very odd. Not to mention that the
legs and arms look very disproportionate, and I don't know... just not
right, somehow.

    Robot mode has some
extras. His hands are only halves of his hands in beast mode, so it looks
like he has FOUR hands instead of two. Also, his monkey parts which fold
back on the upper legs sort of look like a dress. His monkey head parts
kind of stand out. However, he's got a pretty neat weapon, his monkey-tail
whip. His Maximal symbol is under one of the sides of his gold chest.

    This is one of those
figures that you find twelve at your toy store and only two of the others.
Only recommended if you are a collector.

      Due to Megatrons rash cloning experiments,
the Maximals are joined by another new ally; Optimus Minor is a cybernetically-enhanced
monkey with unparalleled speed and agility. Possessing superior balance
and climbing abilities, this highly intelligent cyber-primate must learn
to control his hostile instincts - a side-effect of Megatrons experiments
- and a ferocious advantage in battle. The Predacons learned quickly that
Optimus Minors presence is no laughing matter.
