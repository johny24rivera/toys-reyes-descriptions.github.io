    Megatron's helicopter
mode is very poor, even taking into consideration the size. Basically the
whole robot mode is hanging off the bottom side, completely ruining any
illusion that this helicopter is flight-worthy. It's particuarly bad near
the back end, where the robot legs are clearly thicker and larger than
the helicopter tail piece. On the plus side, the cockpit and wings are
well-sculpted, and the rotors spin quite well. The color scheme is also
quintessentially Megatron, with black and a dull gray being the main colors,
with red serving as a nice accent color. It's not the most eye-catching
color scheme, but it is, of course, Megatron's. The gray is a bit more
of a milky, slightly purplish gray this time around, but it's small enough
of a change to still make the toy look like Megatron while keeping it slightly
unique. Pressing down on the light red part of Megatron's tailfin will
(mostly) automatically transform him, with all that's still required being
unfolding his arms and seperating his legs. However, out of all the Activators
Megatron accidentally transforms the easiest, as his pieces don't seem
to clamp together quite well enough to resist the pull of his internal
springs sometimes. Needless to say, this can get pretty annoying.

    Megatron's robot mode
is the better of the two modes, but it still suffers from some noticeable
kibble problems-- namely, the wings, rotors, tailfin, and the cockpit hang
off of his back. (In other words, the entire alternate mode-- again.) However,
it tends to tuck away a bit better than in vehicle mode, with the cockpit
and tail sections folded onto each other fairly snugly, and the wings behind
the arms is actually show-accurate, so I can't fault the designers there.
Having the rotors still on the wings (they can't be detached) is a tad
annoying, but that's fairly minor. His core robot mode looks excellent,
both in proportions and paint apps-- all of his major details are painted,
and he looks pretty much like he does in the show. His head, arms, and
chest are molded with particularly crisp, accurate detailing. The only
thing I don't like I about the paint is how they only painted the front
of the legs black-- it looks odd seeing the sides gray, why not just mold
the lower legs in black instead? Megatron also has great articulation,
particularly for an Activator-- he can move side-to-side at the neck, as
well as the shoulders (at three places), elbows, wrists (!), hips, knees,
and ankles. The aforementioned backpack does limit his poseability a little,
but other than that he's aces.

    Activator Megatron is
one of the weaker toys, with each of his modes basically carrying the other
mode either on its underside or its back, which hardly gives him points
for an inventive transformation. His helicopter mode is particularly weak,
but his robot mode looks pretty darn good if you ignore the kibble. If
you can possibly afford the
    <a href="animegatron.html">

    </a>
    ,
I'd get that instead, just because it doesn't have as much of a kibble
problem-- however, if you can't afford that, this is an okay substitute
(at least in robot mode), given it's the only other toy of his Earth mode.

      Megatron is the ultimate power behind
the Decepticon army. He is the first and most dangerous warrior ever to
come from Cybertron. Nothing less than total domination of the universe
and absolute control of the power of the AllSpark will satisfy him.
