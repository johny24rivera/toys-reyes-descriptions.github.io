    Powerglide gets an upgrade
for Universe, from a tiny jet to a BIG one (at least in terms of toy size).
In vehicle mode, Powerglide looks great, for the most part. The vehicle
mode proportions are generally spot-on, and there's surprisingly little
robot kibble on the underside. The arms are a little obvious on the underside
of the main wings, though they're compressed and twisted in a manner to
make them somewhat inconspicuous. Those are really his only robot extras
of note-- a real accomplishment on a jet 'former. His landing gear can
pose a bit of a problem, however-- they're oddly off-center on the wings,
and the landing gear that folds down from under his cockpit gets in the
way of his machine gun/missile launcher pegged in that same area in this
mode, making it look even more oddly off-center than it already is. Powerglide
is covered in mold detailing, another big bonus-- plates and "rivets" you
can find molded in everywhere. His paint detailing is adequate with the
red contrasting with the off-white fairly well, but I wouldn't call it
any better than that-- some areas, such as the middle of this mode and
the inside of the rear wings, could still really use some paint. The gunmetal
gray bits on the outside of the turbines and the cockpit are nice touches
color-wise (though I'm not sure why the INSIDE of the turbines weren't
painted the same color), and he's got several military-esque decals on
him. The transparent orange cockpit looks nice, with some seat detailing
inside, and the transparent orange is also a nice color to be used for
the rear part of the turbines, as well. In fact, that's Powerglide's main
feature-- if you press down on the light red button in the middle of his
vehicle mode, you'll hear alternating "turning turbines on" and "swooping"
noises, with the cockpit and turbines blinking on and off a couple of times.
One last noise that's played through an alternating loop when you press
that button is a machine-gun sound, though this one plays (with the blinking
cockpit &amp; turbines) as long as you hold the button down, as opposed
to just once like the others.

    Powerglide's robot mode
is fair, but it's not nearly as good as his vehicle mode. I appreciate
that Powerglide's wings clip to the sides of his body-- not only is it
a good G1 homage, but it cuts down on kibble-- however, including this
and the electronics makes his upper body really bulky proportionally, especially
compared to his rather slim waist and short arms. (During transformation,
a classic "transforming sound" effect is emanated as you bring his waist
forward, though it can activate more than once easily-- also, due to the
placement of the button on vehicle mode, it is pretty easy to activate
Powerglide's sound effects during transformation and, to a lesser extend,
in robot mode, due to how a panel fits up almost against that button.)
His head also sticks up rather awkwardly from in between his engines in
this mode, and he has a few blantant vehicle mode extras-- namely, the
tail wings hanging off his upper back and the cockpit segment hanging down
behind his waist. They don't interfere with movement much, however-- Powerglide's
got some pretty awesome articulation. He can move at the neck (at two points),
shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), waist, hips (at three
points), knees, and ankles. I just wish due to his proportions he was a
bit more pose-worthy-- darn those stubby arms! His wings also don't peg
to the sides of his body all that well, so they can come undone rather
easily when you're moving Powerglide's arms around. I'm also not fond of
the milky greay parts that are more visible in this mode-- they really
don't contrast well at all against Powerglide's already fairly bland off-white
scheme. On the plus side, Powerglide's mold detailing remains excellent
in this mode, and his headsculpt is done absolutely perfectly-- lots of
paint detailing and mold detailing and perfect proportions. His legs are
also done quite well, no complaints there. And there's one detail that's
a really nice, obscure nod-- open up the Autobot panel in the middle of
his chest and you'll see a molded-in heart symbol-- a reference to the
G1 episode "The Girl Who Loved Powerglide"!

    Overall, Powerglide
has a great vehicle mode-- one of the best of its kind-- but his robot
mode suffers a bit proportionally from it-- more specifically, the overly
bulky body and short arms. The wings not pegging into the sides and the
easy-to-activate electronics don't win him any bonus points, either. However,
he is the only mass-release Universe Ultra to have a transformation that
seems complicated enough to justify the large size class, so take that
as you will. If you're not a big one for innovative transformations over
good proportions in both modes, though, this one is a pass. And if you
only want one version of this mold, I'd go for the better-colored

      Not as fast or powerful as the Decepticon
fliers, Powerglide relies instead on his raw skill as a combat pilot. Where
his enemies rely on afterburners and advanced weapon systems, he executes
loops, flat spins, and other aerial maneuvers that make even the craziest
and most foolhardy Decepticons backfire out of fear. In a sky full of bad
guys, you can always easily spot Powerglide twisting and diving through
enemy fire, dodging missiles, and generally outclassing even the best among
the Decepticon air warriors.
