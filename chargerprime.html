    Due to another teamup
between Hasbro and the Chinese electronics company
    <a href="xiaomisoundwave.html">
     Xiaomi
    </a>
    ,
this version of Optimus Prime transforms into a power bank. In alt mode,
it's not much to look at-- just a curved, long cylinder-like structure
that's painted a metallic shade of silver on the sides, with a paler shade
of gray on the top and bottom. There's also an Autobot symbol in that paler
shade on the front, while on the back, there's a clear section (which becomes
his sword) through which you can see a few robot mode parts. Other than
some circuitry lines on the sword, there's no mold detailing in this mode.
Optimus comes with a fairly short USB cord (not pictured) which you can
use to either charge him up or, in turn, have him charge other battery-powered
USB-compatible devices up. He can hold up to 6500 mAh of battery power,
and I totally don't feel like figuring out exactly how much that is, but
it's a decent amount-- he charged up a few of my Playstation controllers
completely before he needed a recharge. By pressing on the small circular
button on the top, there are four lights that will blip on, and it will
run through them one at a time until it gets to the current "charge" level--
if all four lights are currently on, that means he's fully charged, but
if only one of the four lights are blinking, he's getting low and needs
a recharge. While he's charging (or charging something else), these lights
will flash every couple of seconds, letting you know how much charge he
has left/is gaining. It's pretty cool that it actually works, though of
course in terms of play value there's not much you can do with this mode.

    To transform Optimus
into his robot mode, first you take off the sword and shield accessories
from the back. Then you elongate and separate the bottom sections to become
his legs, fold out the side sections to become his arms, fold together
the halves of the head , and then fold up his body at the hips while compressing
the chest a little, and you've got the robot mode. To be sure, in this
mode Optimus has a fair bit of kibble-- there's a large gray section behind
his head that contains the ports and buttons used by the power bank, and
a long bulky gray section coming down behind his main body as well. Of
course, this contains all the actual mass needed for him to be a working
power bank, so I can't be as persnickety about this as I would about most
kibble, but it doesn't look all that great, particularly behind his head.
He still DOES have all the power bank features in this mode, however, and
when the 1-4 lights blink on top of his charger mode, his robot eye lights
blink blue briefly as well, which is a pretty cool feature. Optimus' robot
mode proportions are bit... interesting. He has wide shoulder pads-- which
I actually don't mind as they help make his silhouette a bit more unique--
but man, he has SKINNY upper arms, and his lower arms have some gray kibble
hanging off of them. His hands are also very oddly shaped, and although
he can hold his clear sword fairly well in one, he has a really hard time
holding his shield steady. And speaking of which, it's a WEIRD shield,
as it's got a big hole in the middle of it! Not a very good look for a
shield... you CAN open up the front sides of it to form an oversized claw-like
weapon, but given how loosely Prime can hold it, it's not like you'll actually
be able to clamp down on anything what that claw while he's still holding
it. Meh. A really neat feature with the sword is that if you plug the USB
cord into both it and the port on the top of the charger, it'll glow blue--
VERY cool. Optimus' legs look okay, with fairly small upper legs coming
down to large, clunky lower legs with the sides of the power bank mode
forming the front of said lower legs. He's got large flat feet to help
keep him stable. However, the weight of the upper body with all the power
bank stuff on it causes him to slide down on the sliders on his lower legs
somewhat easily-- those joints aren't made to hold up the weight for a
long period of time or under any real force, which is a shame. For the
main body, Optimus looks weird. Like, they've got the basic "Optimus chest"
details of window-like bits on the top and grill-like bars, but it's clearly
three flat pieces of plastic angled back-and-forth across the front of
the power bank section, and it doesn't look like a solid body at all--
and indeed, from the side you can see right through this section easily.
It was an incredibly odd design decision, here. that said, I do love all
the sleek teched-out angular details here, from the many "levels" on his
"chest windows" to the faux grill and headlight-like details on his abs,
to the armored look on his lower abs and pelvis. His robot parts are where
you see the color on this toy, with the main body and most of the arms
being a fairly dark, milky shade of red, while his head, hands, and much
of his feet are a dark milky blue to give him his normal colors. There's
also a couple of shades of gray-- a flatter one and a milkier one-- used
here and there, and plenty of silver paint on the chest and head. There's
also just a titch of yellow paint on the sides of his waist, to mimic his
headlight details. Optimus' headsculpt is definitely very Optimus-y, though
he has rather large sections on his forehead that look like eyebrows, and
his side antennae, side vents, and faceplate are a bit smaller than normal.
Overall, a cool, stylized look for Prime that matches the angular aesthetic
of the rest of the toy. For articulation, in this mode Optimus can move
at the shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), wrist rotation,
and movement at the hips (at three points), and at the knees and side-to-side
at the ankles. Because of his weight, his movement in the legs is a little
limited, but his arm articulation is okay. I wish he could move his head,
but then that might have messed up his light-up eyes gimmick, and I'd rather
have that, so... yeah.

    Power Bank Optimus Prime
is kind of a neat idea simply because you have a Transformer that's also
a working power bank, but if you don't care about the power bank aspect
this is an easy pass, since as a toy it's a bit lackluster-- this doesn't
nearly get up to the par set by Xiaomi Pad Soundwave (though Soundwave
didn't have to work). One mode doesn't really have playability, while his
robot mode has a really odd main body, some other proportional maladies
in his arms, legs that can't easily support his weight, and a shield accessory
he can't hold all that well. That said, I do like the stylized mold detailing
on his robot mode, and the light-up gimmicks in his eyes and sword are
a nice touch, but still... get it as a power bank first, a figure second.
