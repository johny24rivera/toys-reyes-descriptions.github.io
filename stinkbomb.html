    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 skunk. This mode is very nice, with excellent detailing, a nice mix of
organic and metallic, and no extras on the bottom. The transmetal gold
tail is one of the main features, with a very nice and sharp look to it.
There are, however, two things that don't look right with this mode. For
one, his robot head is easily visible in his rear section. Also, his back
legs look very odd and bulky, using the same cover-up-the-robot-arms technique
used with

    . His spark
crystal is in his left back leg, under the yellow orb.

    Robot mode is okay,
but odd-looking. First off, his skunk back legs are easily visible on his
arms. Second, his skunk back does not fit firmly on his robot back, and
tends to get in the way a lot. Third, and the most obvious downside to
this mode, is his 'hair'. It is his skunk tail, with a claw on the end
of it. It looks very weird to think that his hair is his main weapon. You
would think that it could be detached from his head and fitted into one
of his hands to be used as a sword, but it doesn't. The rest of this mode,
is nicely done, however, from his legs and body, to his head. His face
has a mask on it, and it makes him look like some Marvel superhero.

    A nice transformer,
