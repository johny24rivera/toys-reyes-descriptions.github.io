    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Revenge of
the Fallen deluxe Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read
the review of the original RotF deluxe Sideswipe toy

     Like other figures in
the "Scan" exclusive subline, Sideswipe's vehicle mode is half "normal",
while the back half is mostly clear plastic with some really cool electric
blue "cyber lines" clustered around a white line that's supposed to represent
a scanned vehicle mode-- this is Sideswipe in mid-reformatting, essentially.
The "scan" effect is really sweet, and the clear plastic parts used for
the rear of his vehicle mode and most of the upper half of his robot mode
look pretty cool-- you can see all the little plastic parts inside, though
this does have the side effect of making Sideswipe's robot head visible
in vehicle mode, and with no tinted plastic whatsoever for the windows,
it's considerably easier to see his robot legs inside, where the drivers'
seat should be. The clear plastic isn't the only plastic change for this
version of Sideswipe, though; he also has a pretty good amount of blue
in his robot mode now, which is a GREAT shade and helps add some color
to a scheme that was pretty monochromatic originally. There's also a bit
of light electric blue plastic at the waist, which looks good. On the other
hand, the main body is painted a shade of silvery white that doesn't quite
match the silver paint used on most of his vehicle parts. Because of all
the paint used for the "scan" paint apps, his front bumper is also completely
undetailed when it comes to paint.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Scan Series Sideswipe
has the same awesome "scan line" paint apps and clear plastic that the
other toys in the subline have, but the blue added to the robot mode is
an even better addition, in my opinion. Recommended over the original version
of the mold, though I still think the
     <a href="huntersrumble.html">
      "Hunters'
Rumble" Target 2-pack
     </a>
     beats this version out slightly as having the
best color scheme overall.

       There are two things Sideswipe likes
more than anything else in the galaxy: pummeling Decepticons and fast cars.
He chose to scan a vehicle that would allow him to enjoy both. He now arrives
to the fight in a stylish, cutting-edge sports car ready to junk any Decepticon
that dares put a scratch in his paint!
