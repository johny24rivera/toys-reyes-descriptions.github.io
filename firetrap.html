    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Scattorshot.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     Firetrap has a considerably
more military-esque color scheme than his predecessor Scattorshot, which
is certainly appropriate for the mold. A dark forest green is the main
color, and certainly is a military shade. The main "foil" color for the
green is a tannish orange (mostly visible in robot mode), which contrasts
quite well against said green-- though it's not a color combo I'd write
home about, on the other hand. There's also a few shades of gray here and
there as well, which serve to give a bit more color variation to the plastic
I suppose, but are otherwise pretty unremarkable. The highlight of Firetrap
are his paint apps-- mostly of the gold and silver variety. Both contrast
quite well with the green, and the gold complements the brownish tan in
robot mode fairly well, to boot. The gold stripe running along the sides
of the vehicle mode really helps the color scheme there in particular,
and keeps Firetrap from looking too one-tone in that mode. The windows
are also all painted a nice silvery blue, which goes well with the dark
green as well. I also quite like the Autobot symbols on the sides with
outline stripes around them-- it sort of makes Firetrap look like he's
part of some kind of special Autobot defense team or something.

     Firetrap is a pretty
appropriate, nice recolor of a great mold. The dark green and brownish
tan/gold color combo works quite well, and the paint apps only help that,
helping to keep him from looking boring in either mode. Recommended a little
over RotF Scattorshot.

       To say that Firetrap is enthusiastic
about specialized ammunition is an understatement. He takes every chance
he can to try out unusual shells for his cannons. He's espeecially happy
whenever he can spring strange munitions on an unsuspecting Decepticon
target. It's just bad luck for Sunspot that he happened to be flying over
right after Firetrap secured some brand-new anti-aircraft ammo.
