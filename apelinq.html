    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Optimus Primal Transmetal.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Optimus Primal Transmetal

     The Apelinq toy is very
nice overall. It has the same sense of "balance" to it and the lack of
extras that its predecessor, Optimus Primal Transmetal had. However, the
colors don't contrast with each other that much. Me, I prefer the transmetal
blue on Optimus Primal Transmetal as opposed to the transmetal smoky gray,
but it still has a nice feel to it. The silver, off-white, and reddish
brown all come together to give Apelinq a "rock-like" appearance, like
he was made from materials in the Earth's stone and dirt. In robot mode,
Apelinq, especially the face and outer chest, is colored a bit too much
like Optimus Primal's, making it hard for me to imagine him as a different
character. No mold changes were made to Apelinq, so he retains all the
flaws and features that Optimus Primal Transmetal had.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although Apelinq is
a very nice toy (he didn't earn a rating of 9.0 for nothing, folks), his
color scheme doesn't attract one's eyes like Optimus Primal's Transmetal
does. Thus, unless you are a completist, I would recommend that you get
the cheaper and, in my opinion, better, Optimus Primal Transmetal toy.

       Formerly a head official in a leading
Maximal research facility, Apelinq now uses his considerable skills and
talent commanding a highly-trained, elite team of Cybertronian commandos.
Specializing in computer xenoscience, Apelinq spearheaded much of the advances
unifying conventional technologies with alien cybersystems. He has as much
leadership experience in combat situations as he does in laboratory administration.
Highly skilled in interfacing wetware interlinks with Cybertronian software,
Apelinq utilizes the principles of computational transfer to download solid
objects into reality. The limitations of this hybrid technology are not
yet known. Preferred mode of travel is his "virtual digiboard". In robot
mode, wields dual impact maces, capable of shattering most vanadium-reinforced
armor.
