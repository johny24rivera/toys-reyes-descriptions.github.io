    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Ratchet toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Voyager Ratchet toy

     Everything old is new
again, at least when it comes to many of the repaints of the movie toys--
here, Ratchet gets decked up in his classic G1 colors of white and red
with bit of gray/silver for good measure. The colors worked together very
well on the G1 toy, and the Movie toy is no exception that rule either.
All of the colors provide great contrast against each other, including
the bits of black and dark blue that give Rescue Ratchet a few dark colors
to even things up a little bit. Ratchet's also got some really nifty new
paint apps in his vehicle mode-- namely, a large red stripe going around
his entire form, with his characteristic "heartbeat" sign still on the
sides and "AMBULANCE" added to the side doors and the front hood. (Shouldn't
"AMBULANCE" be backwards on the front hood, though?) The dull orange and
dark blue accent colors used for his headlights look REALLY nice against
the gray, as well. In fact, the only real complaint I have about Rescue
Ratchet's colors has to do with his robot head. Having an almost entirely
red head just looks weird, especially when the red is this light of a shade.
The silver tusks look alright, but that red, just... ick.

     No mold changes have
been made to Rescue Ratchet.

     Rescue Ratchet takes
an already great mold and makes it better by getting rid of (in my opinion)
a fairly ugly greenish-yellow color and replacing it with a much better-looking
and appropriate red-and-white color combo (and that's ignoring the G1 homage).
The head is the only part that's colored oddly. If you only get one version
of Movie Ratchet, get this one.

       Vanity is not a fault from which Autobot
Ratchet typically suffers. He is more concerned with saving the lives of
his fellow Autobots than with what they think about him. HeÂ’s never paid
much attention to the decorations adorning his vehicle mode. However, after
discovering the tendency for human rescue vehicles to be decorated in certain
ways, he started paying more attention to his appearance. His new paint
job helps him fit in, and allows him to help more humans than ever before.
Plus, these new decorations just seem more natural somehow.
