    Beast mode is a technorganic
rat. This mode is actually pretty good for a Happy Meal toy, all things
considered. They even detailed Rattrap's little "pouch" in his back! The
head is nicely detailed mold-wise, but unfortunately, there was no paint
detailing to go along with it. Some more paint detailing around there would
have been greatly appreciated. Rattrap's rear legs are also little more
then wheels with the faintest hint of feet sticking out from under them,
and the look rather bad when compared with the better-done front feet.
In fact, the rear feet look sort of like a downsized version of

    ... Anyway, other than this, and the fact that the green in
this mode is a shade too light, this mode is nice for a "free" toy.

    Rattrap's robot mode
is proof that a Transformer can have a simple transformation and still
look completely different in both modes. All the transformation requires
is a head flip, and turning around of the front legs/hands, and the pulling
out of the back legs/wheels, and you've got a completely different-looking
mode. Although this mode does look a little goofy, Beast Machines Rattrap
looks a bit goofy in robot mode on the show anyway, so at least they're
being accurate. What's sad is that this mode is actually more show-accurate
than the

     Mega-priced
    </a>
    Beast Machines Rattrap
toy! Rattrap's wheels still have to little bumps (aka "feet) on them, which
is rather annoying if you're trying to roll him around. Rattrap's robot
mode face is also colored rather ludicrously. Makes him look like some
kind of mannequin or something- at the very least it makes him look goofy.
Other than these downsides, the rest of this mode is pretty good. True,
Rattrap's beast head doesn't fold down onto his chest in the show, but
it's better then having it fold onto his back, since it would just really
stick out there. Rattrap's allegiance symbol can be found carved on a small
transparent red orb near the bottom of his chest.

    A pretty well-done Maximal,
all things considered. The robot mode looks a little doofy, but at least
they're being consistent with the show...
