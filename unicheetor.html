    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Night Slash
Cheetor. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines
Night Slash Cheetor

     Oh, come on. There's
been so many versions of Cheetor over the years, you couldn't POSSIBLY
expect there not to be a Universe version of him too, right? Well, Universe
Cheetor is a pretty cool repaint, and a redeco of Beast Machines Night
Slash Cheetor (though why they kept the "Night Slash" prefix, when there's
no other Cheetor figure in Universe, is beyond me). The Night Slash Cheetor
mold finally gets a paint job more suited to that of a real cheetah-- that
is, he's primarily golden yellow now. It's by no means an eyesore of a
color, though, since it's a nice dull yellow, so I don't mind it being
a main color like I do with most other yellows. The maroon, black, and
gray colors also help accent the main color nicely. As on most Universe
toys, there are a plethora of various other paint apps on Cheetor, including
some nice bronze paint apps on the wrist, a spray "worn" silver paint app
on the front of his swords, and even little "freckle" cheetah spots under
his robot mode eyes! That's amazing detail, considering how small his face
is. My favorite paint apps, however, are the cool bluish "Energon Radiation"
scars on the sides of his upper arms and legs-- they look REALLY cool,
and are packed with jagged edges and details. But what's even cooler than
that is that they look kind of like spots-- which is, of course, appropriate
for a cheetah. My only complaint about the colors-- and it's a small one--
is that that little spinning chest-doohicky in the original Night Slash
Cheetor's chest, instead of being chrome or some other shiny alternating
color, is just plain reddish brown like its surrounding parts. I rather
liked that rotating chest thing.... Oh, and his spark crystal has an Autobot
symbol just painted over it, but that's typical on Universe figs anyways.

     Universe Cheetor is
a pretty good repaint-- especially when it comes to his Energon radiation
"spots"-- but overall, I think the original Night Slash Cheetor's scheme
of black and orange just looked a bit cooler, even if there wasn't quite
as much paint detailing. But if you can't pick up the earlier version,
and you like beast TFs, then by all means, get this one.
