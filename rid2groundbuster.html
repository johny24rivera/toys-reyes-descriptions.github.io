    "Groundbuster" is a copyright-friendly
name for Groundpounder, which I guess they decided the name for on the
show before the registered a toy trademark. (Which I suppose makes sense,
as he debuted on the show a fairly long time before he got thie toy.) In
alt mode, Groundpounder (I'm going to use that name, it just sounds better.
Alliteration and all.) is an excavator. Unfortunately, the stuff your eye
goes right to-- the red parts-- are the main issues with this mode. I mean,
Groundpounder's robot fist is RIGHT there behind the cockpit area. There's
no attempt to hide it-- in fact, because it's painted red, it's actually
HIGHLIGHTED and thus incredibly hard to ingore. The excavator arm also
suffers a bit from the general simplicity of the design because of the
size, as it's clearly just Groundpounder's claw-arm in robot mode and not
a regular excavator arm for this mode. The "thumb" of the three-pronged
claw is definitely a regular excavator bucket, but you've got two very
obvious fingers above it that don't move out of the way. The claw-arm also
doesn't come up enough above the cockpit to hang down like it should on
an excavator, so it looks a bit off in that respect as well. The rest of
the mode is pretty solid, especially for a Legion-class toy. If you want
to get picky you get see the top of Groundpounder's robot head on the bottom
rear end of this mode, but it's covered up pretty well by the pieces above
it. As far as the color scheme, it's a fairly light blue, a REALLY light
milky gray to the point where it's nearly white, and the aforementioned
bit of red on the obvious robot fists and claw. There's also some metallic
black paint on the windows. Ideally I wish the treads had been painted
black, but on a Legion-class figure I suppose that's a bit unrealistic,
especially with his other paint bits. The type of plastic used for the
light milky gray also I think isn't the right kind of plastic to "hold"
paint on, anyways. The blue and red certainly contast against each other
nicely enough, but that very light milky gray is too bland, I think. Used
as a minor accent color it might've helped to give a "neutral" color for
the blue and red to work against, but having his entire tread pieces be
this color just doesn't look good. As far as the mold detailing, his treads
are very intricately detailed, especially for a RID2015 toy. The rest of
the toy has some basic stylistic detailing with some angles here and there,
but is fairly standard for the line-- that said, given the small size,
he still certainly has "enough". (There IS one cool long tiny piston detail
inside the hollow part of his lower claw-arm, though.)

    To transform Groundpounder,
the treads go on the back, you unfold the arms out and down, and then fold
out the legs from underneath the vehicle mode. Ta-da! Groundpounder's robot
mode is definitely the mode that has the priority, and he looks like a
gorilla; he's got very long arms, a fairly long body, and short legs. His
head is also very gorilla-like, being fairly round with a large forehead,
big chin, and a relatively small silver face with light blue eyes. I do
love his overall look, as he's one of the animalistic Decepticon designs,
which are always my favorites. The different proportions certainly make
him unique, and him having a "regular" long arm and the claw-arm from vehicle
mode as his other arm makes him even more unique. The treads are obviously
extras, but they frame his shoulders in such a way that I don't mind them
at all; they actually enhance the mode's silhouette, if you ask me. His
short gray legs have some basic toe and kneecap details, but otherwise
aren't that noteworthy (mostly because they're so small). The chest has
some basic "divot" details, along with some metallic red paint. Oddly,
this is NOT the same red paint that's used on the hands, but rather a darker,
more shiny shade of the color. There's some black on the upper left arm
and lower right arm, but otherwise beyond that and the silver on the face
there's no paint specifically for this mode. The legs could've used some
paint, but otherwise given that this is such a small toy, his colors are
still broken up enough. For articulation in this mode, Groundpounder can
move at the shoulders, elbow on the right arm, and at the hips, with most
of these on ball joints, so he's roughly average in this respect for a
Legion class toy.

    Groundbuster/Groundpounder's
robot mode is incredibly unique and fantastic, with some great proportions,
a cool "gorilla" look, and with even the kibble on the back framing his
shoulders well. His excavator mode is a bit less impressive-- mostly because
of the obvious fist and claw-- but still decent. If there was a larger
version with a better alt mode I'd definitely recommend that one over this
Legion toy because Groundpounder's kind of a big guy, but unfortunately
this was the only toy of the character released, which is definitely a
shame (though still certainly better than nothing). If you like unique
Decepticon designs, this is an easy recommendation.
