    Yay, finally a scout-class
Transformer that's actually in the movie! And... he's a toaster! That will
either make you really happy or really bored. I'm solidly in the former
category. It's always nice to see Transformers branching out into more
unconventional alt modes, and though Ejector's alt mode doesn't excite
me as much as
    <a href="rotfransack.html">
     some others
    </a>
    , it's a new one
for TFs, which is rare in this day and age. However... it's a toaster,
and that's really it. It's got a nice shade of metallic silver to give
him that nice gleam, and his buttons are painted all all that, but you
can't really do much with this mode. I guess you can twirl the plug by
the piece of twine that connects it to the rest of the toy, I guess. As
you'd expect from a Transformer who transforms into a box (more or less),
there's telltale cracks in the alt mode, but otherwise there's no real
robot mode extras. The side that the cord comes out of isn't painted like
the others and is partially hollow, though. I guess that's the edge you
point away from view (as in the above picture).

    Ejector has a pretty
unique robot mode, too. The thing that sticks out the most is his big,
cartoonish-looking oversized head that takes up practically all of his
main body. It looks hilarious, but it's noticeably in stark contrast to
the movie aesthetic. Again, you either like that or you don't. I'm charmed
by it. Ejector also has four arms, though they both connect to the main
body at one place, so he only two shoulders. Ejector's bottom half seems
based loosely on a satyr (which is supported by the little horns on his
head), with goat-esque legs that have incredibly tiny feet. Unfortunately,
this means he's rather difficult to get to stand up straight. The plug/cord
tail is a brilliant use of a piece of his toaster mode and fits in with
his satyr look, and he doesn't really have any obvious toaster mode kibble--
there's a small bit of plastic hanging off his lower legs, but that's about
it. The light orange "heating coil" detailing on his stomach and waist
looks pretty cool and helps give him at least a bit of color, but again,
he's a toaster, you're not gonna get a particularly eye-catching color
scheme from his. As for articulation, he can move at the jaw (at two places),
shoulders (at two places), the elbow at each arm, at the base of his fingers
(as one piece) on the two arms closest to his main body, and at the hips,
knees (at two places), and ankles. His leg movement is a bit two-dimensional,
however (mostly just forward-to-back movement), and there's the aforementioned
instability issue, so he's not as posable as he seems from that description.

    As a Transformer design
by itself Ejector definitely isn't bad, though he does have a few minor
problems, like an alt mode you can't do much with and somewhat limited
articulation in robot mode. However, not only he is the first Transformer
toaster, he also has a four-armed cartoony little demon-esque robot mode.
That's where the majority of his charm comes from-- so if you're looking
for a unique TF, you've found it. If you want a more serious-looking Transformer
with a sleek alt mode, look elsewhere.

      Born mindless and driven by the heat
pulsing in his tiny body, Ejector knows nothing but how to burn. Even when
he was a simple toaster burning things was what he did best. Now that he's
got a simple mind of his own, and flamethrowers to go with it, he lives
to torch everything around him.
