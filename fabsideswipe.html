    Sideswipe's vehicle mode
is a Centennial Corvette, and compared to the
    <a href="rotfsideswipe.html">
     "mainline"
versions
    </a>
    , it's surprisingly accurate for a Fast Action battler. Some
edges have been rounded a bit more, but that's no biggie. What is a major
point against this mode, though, is the dull milky gray plastic used instead
of that sweet silver paint on most of the other toys of him. It really
makes the mode look boring in comparison, even if the incredibly awesome
vehicle design does help some regardless. However, as far as paint apps
go, Battle Blade Sideswipe has all the requisite ones-- his grill, headlights
and taillights, hubcaps, tailpipes, and windows are all painted. I particularly
like the shade used for the latter-- the sharp metallic blue really works
well with against the light gray, and adds at least a little more visual
interest to this mode. On one last very positive note, there are no robot
extras visible whatsoever in this mode.

    Sideswipe's robot mode,
unfortunately, is one of the most oddly-proportioned among the RotF Fast
Action Battlers. His arms are the main perpetrator, being ridiculously
two-dimensional. Even the hands molded into the sides of those car parts
that become his arms and arm-blades don't stick out much. Plus, his right
arm has a "slashing" gimmick, which means if you pull up on the arm and
release it, it flings back to its previous position-- which might me cool
for a few seconds, but means that arm isn't nearly as posable as his left
arm, which has no such gimmick. In addition to this, the top of his car
mode just hands off his back unceremoniously. Granted, it's folded in half
to make it at least a little less visually off-putting, but having hollow
car parts hanging off his back certainly isn't a positive. His head and
chest, though well-sculpted and painted by themselves, are oddly overly
large proportionally when compared to the rest of his robot mode. No complaints
about his legs, though-- they're well-proportioned, and the addition of
a dull brownish gray with silver paint over to it adds a bit more contrast
on a figure that has little. Plus, little toes flip out of his feet-tires,
making him able to stand easily-- that's ONE point over his mainline deluxe
version, anyway. As for articulation, it's typical for a FAB (i.e., not
good, as that's not generally the focus of these toys)-- he can move at
the neck (at two points), shoulders, hips, and knees, almost all of it
stricly back-and-forth motion and not in two dimensions.

    Battle Blade Sideswipe
is one of the weaker FABs to come out of the RotF line. His vehicle mode,
while lacking the nice silver paint finish of most of his other toys, is
pretty solid, but his robot mode has very weird proportions and downright
bad articulation. Only recommended for huge Sideswipes or little kids who
absolutely want a transformable Sideswipe toy that isn't tiny.

      Sideswipe practiced for years to become
the sword master he is today. He is proud of his blades, and treats them
better than any other part of his body. He constantly sharpens and polishes
them to make sure they're always ready when the Decepticons appear.
