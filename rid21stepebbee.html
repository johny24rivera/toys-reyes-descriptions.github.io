    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
2016 Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Welp, it's been half
a year since the previous Bumblebee release in this size class, so time
for a 'Bee redeco! "Energon Boost" Bumblebee, upon first look, looks to
just be Bumblebee with light blue-- and to some extent, it is-- but there's
more differences than that. For one, when comapred with the original version
of this mold, the yellow is SLIGHTLY brighter-- just a shade or two, but
noticeable. Black is also still quite present-- beyond black plastic being
obviously used on the tires, and on the piece that is behind his shoulders
in robot mode, there's also black paint on the front window in vehicle
mode and on the waist in robot mode. As far as the blue goes, it's used
on bits of the front hood (the diagonal details), as well as one the headlights,
rear windows and vent-like details below them, and on the faux window-chest,
eyes, center of his headcrest, and on some semi-decorative bits on his
robot shoulders. All in all it's used rather profusely in robot mode in
particular, and helps lighten up Bumblebee's scheme a bit compared to this
mold's original color scheme. The shoulder paint apps look particularly
good, and help set him apart at least a bit and give him a bit of a decorative
flair. That said, having the front window black while the rear window is
blue in vehicle mode looks rather weird. Additionally, these new blue paint
apps come at a cost-- compared to original 2016 version, paint has been
removed from the robot abs and center of the front vehicle grill. Bumblebee
still has his head painted silver, at least, but other than that silver
is nowhere to be found on this toy.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Energon Boost Bumblebee.

     If you own the original
version of the 2016 1-step changer, there's no real reason to get Energon
Boost Bumblebee-- he's too similar, being still largely yellow and blue,
with the only obvious difference being the addition of light blue to the
color scheme. However, if you're trying to decide which version of this
mold to get for RID2015, I'd recommend this one slightly more-- not only
because the blue adds a bit different of a flair to 'Bee's usual "black/yellow/gray"
color scheme, but I think the blue helps the color scheme pop a little
more, and the pure black paint looks better than the charcoal black on
the original 2016 release of this mold.
