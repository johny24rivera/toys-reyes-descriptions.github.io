    Zoom Out's alternate
mode is a digital video camera, complete with a see-through lens. It's
very realistic in its proportions, though unfortunately the size is a bit
too small for it to pass off as a real video camera. Zoom Out also sports
a nifty "viewfinder" in this mode, with a sticker of
    <a href="override.html">
     Cybertron
Override
    </a>
    on the inside of said viewfinder, along with the prerequisite
other symbols to try to make you believe you're looking at Override through
the camera's viewfinder, like a "battery charge" symbol and how a digital
ticker for how long you've been recording printed on the sticker. It irks
me that Cybertron characters are being used on the Real Gear robots when
the Real Gears are part of the movie line, though. Zoom Out has a fair
amount of mold detailing, with the appropriate buttons and such molded
into the toy at the appropriate places (though none of them can be pushed
in, unfortunately). The paint detailing is a little sparse, video cameras
don't exactly have a lot of different colors on them to begin with, which
is why the very dull "two shades of gray" color scheme doesn't bug me quite
as much as it normally would. There is only one robot extra visible in
this mode, though it is really obvious-- the back of Zoom Out's head is
plainly visible on one side of this mode, and all it would have taken was
an extra little panel to cover that thing up.

    Zoom Out's robot mode
is also rather cool, except for the arms. The arms are way too dinky proportionally,
they're too close to the body, and the lens pieces sticking out from the
shoulders look a bit clunky and odd. Zoom Out has claws, but they can't
open or close, unfortunately. Otherwise, though, his articulation is great
for a toy of his size-- he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points),
elbows, hips (at two points), and knees (at two points). And, given that
he's not back heavy, that means you can get quite a few poses out of him.
I love love LOVE Zoom Out's head design-- the large monocle-eye and square
jaw really give him some personality, like he's some evil scientist or
something, and his monocle-eye also fits with his alternate mode to boot.
I also love how his viewfinder on his back seperates into "insect wings"--
it's very creative and gives a bit more individuality to his design. The
only prevalent "new" color that's in Zoom Out's robot mode that isn't in
his vehicle mode, however, is a dull blue, which doesn't come close to
livening up the color scheme. Something a bit brighter with more contrast
should have been used to make Zoom Out look more visually interesting.
I'm also not a huge fan of his his chest is angled against the rest of
his body (which just one more hinge on his upper chest could have solved)--
it leaves a noticeable see-through gap in Zoom Out's chest if you look
at it from anything close to a side view. The mold detailing on the "robot
bits" inside the chest pieces and on the inside of the "wings" is great,
though, with wires and gears molded in all over the place-- something totally
unnecessary given that they're not readily visible in either mode, but
still definitely appreciated nonetheless.

    Zoom Out is slightly
below-average for a Real Gear, but that's more due to the fact that the
subline is so great than anything else. He's still a pretty good Transformer,
with only a few problems like the visible head in camera mode, the very
dull color scheme, and the overly large shoulders and small hands in robot
mode. Mildly recommended.

      Zoom Out 25X is inhumanly patient. He'll
wait for days or weeks in his camera mode without moving or making a sound,
just to get the perfect shot of you doing something you shouldn't. Then,
using his editing features, he'll alter the video to be as embarrassing
as possible. He doesn't' do this because it's his mission or anything -
he just likes to cause trouble.
