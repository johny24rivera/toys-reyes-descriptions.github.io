    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RID2015 Backtrack. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Backtrack

     Ransack is Backtrack's
buddy, and the darker of the two. His main color is a very dark military
green which-- if you look at it in the light-- has a bit of a milky, "impure"
sheen to it, but which I actually think helps on this dark of a shade.
(Honestly I wish the green was a bit lighter.) The main contrast color
on the main toy itself is a considerably lighter forest green, though it's
still a bit dull compared to your "average" shade of green-- the latter
is mostly used on some internal robot parts like the upper legs and upper
arms, though there's also some green curved stripes on most of the bottom
half of the ball mode. As with the other versions of this mold, I wish
the curved painted stripes went all around the ball mode, but it still
helps give some contrast to all the dark green. Beyond simply these main
two shades of green, Ransack has a yellow paint app on his belly blaster/button
on the front, and his eyes in robot mode are a dark red. (Unfortunately,
his face is the same dark green as the rest of that piece; having no silver
on the face like there is on Backtrack doesn't look good.) Finally, for
the translucent armor pieces Ransack has a pale purple shade, which looks
pretty good itself though I think making the purple a bit lighter/brighter
would've helped it contrast against the dark green more.

     Honestly, I can't really
decide whether Ransack or Backtrack (the regular version) is better. Backtrack's
armor looks cooler and his face is painted, but I think Ransack's secondary
colors on the main toy are better and his two shades of green complement
each other quite well. If you're only going to get one version of this
(rather bad) mold, I'd make it the

     version; beyond that version, well... Backtrack and
Ransack are both on the same plane to me, just different.
