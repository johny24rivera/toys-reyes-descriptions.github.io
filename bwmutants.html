     The evil Megatron has
developed an experimental anti-conversion virus with which he plans to
win the Beast Wars! This toxin infects its host and prevents the ability
to change into robot mode - eventually causing permanent shutdown. But
something went wrong...when unleashed on several Fuzors, it caused a reconfiguration
of their conversion abilities, trapping their robot modes inside two different
beast modes. Now, bewildered by new and potent extrasensory powers plus
the ability to change into two ferocious animals, these Transformers join
together to form a renegade band of warriors. This is...Mutant Beast Wars!

     This is the backstory for
the Beast Wars Mutants, the only Beast Wars toy line that is not backed
by the show. Mutant Beast Warriors first started to come out in April 2000,
and then quickly spread to the rest of the U.S. and Canada. The Mutants
introduce a new concept into the Transformers toy line; they have two beast
modes, but no robot mode. To symbolize that these are transformers, however,
and not morphing creatures, there are robot heads hidden in the animal
bodies, and sometimes there are also little hidden mechanical details on
some parts. This concept of transformers is a new challenge for Hasbro
toy designers. For the other transformers, only one mode had to look like
a recognizable animal or vehicle, while the other robot mode could be constructed
from any "extras" or animal parts that could be connected together, and
the transformer only had to be slightly humanoid in form in robot mode.
Now, not one, but BOTH modes have to look like a recognizable animal. Because
of the extreme challenge involved in making a transformer toy with two
recognizable modes, at least one animal mode in the Mutants is a little
out of proportion, or is the wrong color(s). From the backstory, one can
come to a conclusion that these Mutants have formed their own side, and
they are neither Maximal nor Predacon. A neat touch to the backstory is
that the "anti-conversion virus" sort of ties in the stories between Beast
Wars and Beast Machines, and this very same virus is probably the one Megatron
used to take over Cybertron.
