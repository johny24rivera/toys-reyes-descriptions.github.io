        This exclusive version
of the big ol' Bumblebee toy for the year has a really snazzy VERY shiny
gold finish over all of the formerly orangish-yellow parts. It makes the
thing look like it were almost literally made of gold in vehicle mode.
He also has chrome silver hubcaps and a chrome silver tip to his cannon
arm, and his claw-hand that can pop out of said arm is now clear plastic
instead of transparent blue (though the electronic lights are still all
red). Most of the paint apps on this version of Battle Ops Bumblebee are
the same as on the mass-release version, though there are a few minor differences,
such as a few more paint apps on the crotch area and a few less on the
front bumper.

           What's this? TWO Bumblebees
in the same package? Well, that's... a little overkill. That aside though,
like the Battle Ops version, this "Premium" Legends class Bumblebee certainly
lives up to its name. It's almost entirely vacuum-metallized (i.e., chrome)
gold, with some black plastic on the relevant parts like the tires and
upper robot legs. With the exception of the vehicle mode stripes, there's
no paint apps on "Premium" Bumblebee, but honestly, with the toy being
this small and the chrome gold looking so pretty, that's not a huge deal
here. The only place it really needs some paint where it doesn't have any
is the robot head, frankly. What with this being such a small toy, though,
and the chrome gold pieces having so many narrow "edges", I do worry a
little about chipping down the road.

                Bumblebee is ready for anything, any
time. Though he's known among the Autobots for his sense of humor, he is
also a dangerous warrior with decades of experience under his hood. His
demeanor changes with all the speed of his vehicle mode; he is never caught
unprepared for a fight. Though the Decepticons have tried for years to
destroy him, they have always failed. He has survived grevious injury and
even serious defeat, but he always comes back with a grin on his grill,
ready for more.

                If you're in the market
for a big Bumblebee and have a Costco membership, at a mere $42 for all
three toys there's no reason NOT to get this toy, honestly-- considering
that just the regular Battle Ops Bumblebee is $60 at mass retail! Even
if they were the same price or if this version were slightly more expensive,
though, I'd recommend this 3-pack over the main Battle Ops Bumblebee release,
simply because the two Bumblebees in the set look so gorgeous (one with
its shiny gold paint and the other with its gold chrome). The Mudflap is
kinda meh, but considering you're getting it for "less than free", it's
hard to complain about it.
