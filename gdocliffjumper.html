    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime First
Edition Cliffjumper. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     A few of the various
"GDO" Generations exclusives have admittedly had me scratching my head
a little, but I could see where the designers were coming from. GDO Cliffjumper
is not one of those releases-- I'm completely, utterly baffled by this
toy's existence. This is the Prime First Edition Cliffjumper mold, alright--
there's been practically NO changes for this release at all (and this release
was out at about the same time as the other releases of this mold). The
one main change made to this version of Cliffjumper color-wise is that
his red plastic is a few shades darker/duller than the Prime First Edition
release. Not quite as obvious is that the silver paint has been darkened
slightly to a more metallic gunmetal gray. Other than that, all of GDO
Cliffjumper's paint apps and colors are precisely the same as they are
on the Prime First Edition toy (with the exception of the tailights, which
are left gunmetal gray on this version).

     Cliffjumper does have
one mold change, however, and one that might matter to a few people-- his
head sculpt has been changed, to represent a more G1-y Cliffjumper head.
It's well-sculpted, and the light piping for the eyes works wonderfully;
however, he's got a rather blank stare on his face, which means this headsculpt
doesn't give off nearly as much personality as Prime Cliffjumper's.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     If you love the Prime
First Edition Cliffjumper design, but absolutely HATE the Prime Cliffjumper
head-- well, this release is for you. If you don't fit in that tiny portion
of the fandom, though, go for one of the Prime First Edition versions of
the mold instead-- the headsculpts have got more personality than this
one's, and I think the slightly lighter red on the others is a little more
eye-catching.

       Cliffjumper has more fight in him than
any other three Autobots combined. Brash, bold, and aggressive, he ignores
his small size and weak armor in favor of just charging in and hoping for
the best. No other Autobot has won so many fights through sheer attitude
alone.
