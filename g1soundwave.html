       Laserbeak's alternate
mode is a cassette tape. Obviously, it's not a solid cassette tape due
the transformation, so it's obviously not a real cassette tape, but it
still looks fairly good given the technology of the time that the toy was
made. The stickers do make the creases in the toy more obvious than just
straight paint apps would have, but they weren't able to do paint tampos
at that time, so there you go. The creases aside, this mode is pretty good,
and the stickers give some realistic details to it like labels of the tape
sides and measurements and whatnot.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       In bird mode, Laserbeak
looks fairly good, even by today's standards. His feet are rather oddly
shaped, but otherwise he has pretty good proportions, and the large guns
on his back add some needed bulk to his frame. The red-and-black color
scheme is pretty basic, but works well for a Decepticon, and the golden
eyes look nice against the black. (The red body, by the way, is diecast.)
I also like the mold detailing on his head-- he looks appropriately stern
and menacing for a Decepticon minion. Laserbeak and move back-and-forth
at two points on the wings, as well as up-and-down at two points on the
head.
      </font>
      <br/>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Laserbeak is the better
of Soundwave's two cassettes, with a decent, if obviously fake, cassette
mode and a nice bird mode that still holds its own even today.

          Ravage's cassette tape
mode isn't nearly as convincing as Laserbeak's, even taking into account
the requisite creases throughout the mode. The reason for this is that
the jaguar legs (which are diecast) stick out like a sore thumb, being
mostly different in color from the rest of the toy and also making the
tape mode look pretty asymmetrical as well. The stickers do add some realistic
details to the cassette mode, though, like the measurements and side labels
that were also on Laserbeak's stickers.

         <br/>
         <font face="OCR A Extended">
          Ravage's beast mode
may have been passable back in its day, but it looks rather goofy now.
Reason being that it's so two-dimensional, it's almost like Ravage got
run over by a steamroller. From a side view, he looks alright (if rather
stiff-looking), but he has almost no width at all, outside of his side-mounted
chrome silver guns, which do look pretty cool. He does have rather good
articulation, however, with back-and-forth motion at his hips, knees, ankles,
tail, and at two points on his neck. The black-and-silver color scheme,
while plain, also fits the beast mode nicely.
         </font>
         <br/>
         <font face="OCR A Extended">
          Ravage is the only one
of the trio that doesn't hold up well enough under today's standards, with
an unconvincing tape mode and a very two-dimensional beast mode. He does
have the best articulation out of the toys in the set, however.

             In his micro-cassette
player mode, Soundwave looks very realistic for a Transformer. His buttons
can't be pressed in, and the back of his head is rather visible on the
top of this mode, but otherwise it's flawless. There's tons of little details
on his stickers, like miniature "rec" and "stop" button arrows and a fake
battery light. He also has a turnable "volume wheel" and an on/off switch
on his sides! His overall color scheme of dark blue, silver, and some red
also looks great, even if it's not the most dynamic scheme I've ever seen.
Unlike the original G1 toy, this Soundwave reissue has had its mold taken
from the Japanese Soundblaster reissue-- a repaint of the original G1 toy,
but with one important modification-- the flip-down cassette door can hold
two tapes, not just one! This makes Soundwave's chest stick out slightly
more than on the original G1 toy, but it's definitely worth it considering
that he can hold both of his tapes.
            </font>
            <br/>
            <font face="OCR A Extended">
             In robot mode, Soundwave
is pretty boxy, but his proportions are pretty good for the most part (besides
a rather wide chest, which is a necessity given his tape-launching schtick).
He also has pretty good articulation for a toy from his time-- he can move
at the head, back-and-forth at the shoulders and elbows, and forwards at
the knees. His toes are the only diecast parts on him. His weapons are
very inventive-- I love how they're made from the batteries of his cassette
player mode, with one becoming a handheld gun and the other becoming a
shoulder-mounted cannon. The missiles can't be stores in the cassette player
mode, though, which always bugs me. He has the same opening-chest schtick
in this mode that he has in his other mode, so you can still launch his
tapes to your hearts' content. Oh, and his Decepticon rub symbol is on
his lower back, in case you're wondering.
            </font>
            <br/>
            <font face="OCR A Extended">
             Soundwave is a great
toy, and only slightly limited in some aspects even by today's standards.
Definitely one of the best G1 toys made.

             <font face="OCR A Extended">
              G1 Reissue Soundwave
was one of the best G1 toys already, but even after all these years there
hasn't been a gimmick that's been quite as cool as having a miniature cassette
tape army for a Transformer. This highly increases the desirability of
a toy that is already decent even by today's standards, and given that
he comes with two cassette buddies-- one of them pretty cool even today--
and he retails for the very reasonable price of $30 U.S., he's the G1 Reissue
I'd recommend the most out of all of them.

                It is said Soundwave can hear a fly
sneeze. Uses anything he hears for blackmail to advance his status. Opportunist.
Despised by all other Decepticons. Sensors can detect even lowest energy

impulses. Acts as radio link for others. Locates and identifies Autobots,
then informs Decepticons. Carries a concussion blaster gun. Often target
