    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations deluxe Trailcutter.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations deluxe
Trailcutter

     Hoist-- as is almost
always the case-- is a remold of Trailbreaker/cutter, and his color scheme
fits fairly closely with
     <a href="g1hoist.html">
      his G1 self
     </a>
     , as you'd
expect. The green plastic that's used for most of Hoist's coloration is
a bit more "medium" of a shade compared to his G1 toy, though, and I like
this shade better-- it's just more attractive of a shade, and makes the
toy stand out a bit more on a shelf of deluxe Autobots. One of Hoist's
other main colors is a rather eye-catching shade of orange, quite light
and just a shade or so duller than the uber-bright "safety" orange. It
contrasts excellently with the other, duller, colors, and really helps
to make this color scheme pop when it otherwise really wouldn't have. Hoist
has a fair amount of black and gray as well, with the latter being a medium-range
milky shade that actually looks decent on the relatively few parts where
it's used (mostly evident in robot mode). The black is a bit more prevalent,
but both serve as nice "neutral" colors for the green and orange to contrast
against. Additionally, there's some transparent blue plastic used for his
windows, but it's so pale it's almost like it's not there. For paint apps,
there's a fair amount of silver used on such details like the middle of
his wheels, his lower arms, his headlights, his "missile rack", and the
like, and generally these paint apps are spread out quite well over Hoist's
chassis. The exception to this is the back end of his vehicle mode, which
really should've had some paint applied to his truck bed and/or taillights.
The yellow/black "caution lines" on the sides and on his crane arm are
a nice extra touch that helps to give Hoist's color scheme a bit more individuality,
but the line on the sides should have been made longer, like on the G1
toy-- they look way too short here. There's also some issues with the green
and orange paint not quite matching up to their plastic counterparts. The
orange paint is noticeably duller than the orange plastic, and the green
paint is actually of a darker, semi-metallic shade, to the point where
it sticks out against the green plastic very noticeably (thankfully, said
green paint is only used around Hoist's windows).

     Hoist has two mold changes
made, the most obvious being that Trailcutter's back shield/canopy section
has been replaced with a crane arm that can convert into a pistol for Hoist
to hold in robot mode. As a weapon, this new accessory looks alright, but
as a crane hook it's way too small and flimsy-looking. Plus, the rear section
of the vehicle mode has not been remolded to give it a deeper bed, making
Hoist's back half look way too chunky for a tow truck, and is my biggest
beef with Hoist overall. Hoist has a new head sculpt as well, which looks
wonderful both in terms of mold detailing and having a nice silver faceplate--
it's very much like his G1 toy's face, but updated with more "modern" proportions
like a smaller faceplate.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Generations deluxe Hoist,
color-wise, looks a bit more interesting than his duller-in-color mold
predecessor Trailcutter, and I love the rather unique color combo of orange
and green, in particular, as well as the yellow/black "caution" lines.
However, the replacement of Trailcutter's canopy/rear vehicle section with
an overly small crane arm-- and the lack of remolding to the rear section
of the vehicle mode-- makes said vehicle mode look weak enough where, despite
the superior colors, I'd have to recommend the Trailcutter version of the
mold over this guy.

       When an Autobot is seriously damaged
in the field, he goes to Autobot Ratchet, but for everyday aches and pains,
Hoist is the most trusted guy around. There's no strut or spar Hoist can't
fix, and no malady so baffling that he can't diagnose it. He supplements
his vast knowledge with an easy bedside manner that makes him well liked
by his fellow Autobots and universally acknowledged as the expert on everything
from wrist rust to scraplets.
