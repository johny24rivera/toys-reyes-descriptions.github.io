    Given the growing popularity
of the Legends class toys, it was only a matter of time before the
    <a href="g1prime.html">
     Generation
One "classic" design
    </a>
    of Optimus Prime got remade in this size, I suppose.
In vehicle mode, this version of Optimus Prime looks pretty much exactly
as it should-- a red square cab, silver smokestacks poking out of the back
end, and the dark blue robot legs forming the tail end of the mode. However,
due to the small scale, Prime's robot toes stick straight up from the back
end in this mode, making it even more obvious than normal that the back
end is made up of his legs-- he also doesn't have any real rear bumper
to speak of, either. The middle tire on each side is also fake, with only
the front and back tires actually rolling. The latter isn't that much of
a downside, though, given how cheap these little figures are-- something
had to give, after all. Pretty much every necessary detail is painted in
this mode, a rarity for a Legends class toy-- the windows are painted that
nice light silvery blue, and his grill, headlights, and the like are all
painted silver. His side windows aren't painted, but those are rather small
details so that's not a big deal. (And speaking of mold detailing, this
toy has it in spades-- all of the necessary tiny little details are packed
into this guy, the level of detail stopping juuust short of actually molding
in little rivets on the toy. Wow!) Given the whole "Reveal the Shield"
gimmick of the subline this toy was released in, Prime also has a small
sticker on the left side of this mode that, if you rub it, reveals that
he's an Autobot (wow, who knew?!).

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Optimus Prime's robot
mode suffers a little more from the small scale than his vehicle mode did,
but it's still quite good given the inherent limitations of the tiny size
class (in fact, the transformation is nearly identical to the much-larger
G1 toy, which shows you how far toy design has come since the '80s). His
abs are merely molded onto the otherside of the piece that forms his truck
grill, and his hands have the front wheels just hanging off them unceremoniously,
but that's it when it comes to vehicle mode extras. The proportions are
pretty darn good, if a bit more "curvy" and "puffy" in the legs than he's
traditionally been. The details on his chest, arms, and head are nice,
crisp, and accurate to the cartoon, however. Most of his paint detailing
carries over to this mode, though the couple of new details like the fine
paint detailing on his head and abs are a nice touch. (That said, a bit
of paint on his hands and/or waist wouldn't have hurt.) Optimus Prime's
biggest downside in this mode is probably his articulation-- he has a few
points of movement, but it's nothing great. He can move at the shoulders
(at two points), elbows, and restricted movement at his hips, due to part
of the truck grill being behind those joints. (He can TECHNICALLY rotate
at the mid-section, but it's just below his chest, and thus doesn't really
look right if used any more than the slightest amount-- it's a side effect
of his transformation, not a deliberate point of movement in this mode.)

    "Reveal the Shield"
Legends class Optimus Prime is a great downsized version of his G1 design,
and remains quite faithful to it in both modes. A few limitations of the
size class are apparent-- such as his obvious toes in vehicle mode, the
wheels hanging off his arms in robot mode, and his limited range of movement--
but for the price, you won't find many molds better than this one. Recommended
for Optimus or Legends fans.

      Review by Beastbot
     </font>
     <p>
      *In 2012, this toy was re-released in Generations packaging at discount
outlets like Dollar Stores. The colors and paint apps are the same as on
this initial version, but with the "Reveal the Shield" sticker removed
and an Autobot symbol painted on in its place. Also, the Generations version
came with a small extra sword accessory, which is why I rate that release
slightly higher than the one reviewed.
