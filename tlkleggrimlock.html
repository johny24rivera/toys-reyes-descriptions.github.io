    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Rippersnapper toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Prime legion Rippersnapper toy

     It seems Hasbro just
isn't willing to give Movie Grimlock his own mold for Legion class, so
he's got a re-use of the Prime Rippersnapper mold again. As with the other
TLK Grimlock redecoes of AoE molds, though, this time around he's given
a duller, grayer color scheme more inline with his appearance in the movie.
The toy's main color-- mostly used for the main body of each mode, as well
as the tail-- is a fairly dark, milky brownish gray, with more of an emphasis
on the gray out of the two colors. It is actually semi-metallic in shade,
though, having a bit of glitter mixed in with it, which is appreciated.
What isn't appreciated is the extremely blah, bland light mliky gray plastic
used for the beast mode appendages as well as the upper legs of the robot
mode-- I really wish Hasbro would stop using this color, it's so boring.
There's some glossy black paint used on the "ribs" and abs of the robot
mode chest, which helps add a bit more "darkness" to the overall scheme
but largely just keeps it monochromatic. There's some silver on the robot
face and front of the beast mode headcrest, and red paint on both the beast
mode and robot eyes, as well as on the small Autobot symbol on the right
side of the robot chest. The red are the only bits of color that aren't
largely in the monochromatic spectrum, making Grimlock not look as interesting
as he otherwise would. I also wish he had a bit more paint on some of the
(relatively) large pieces of dark brownish gray plastic, like on his large
fin-crest on his back and his tail in beast mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Grimlock.

certainly isn't anything to write home about. Hasbro is still using the
same mold made for a completely different character for 2 movies now, only
this time, the color scheme is grayer and blander than the AoE redecoes.
Unless you just really love this mold (which, quite frankly, I do-- I have
a soft spot for all the Prime Predacons designs), I'd say this release
is an easy skip.
