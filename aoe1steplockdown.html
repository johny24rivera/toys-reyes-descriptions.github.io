    Lockdown's Lamborghini
Aventador alt mode makes the transition to a one-step changer quite well,
with his vehicle mode being about as reasonably close as you can expect
a toy of this size to be to an officially licensed high-end car. Proportionally
he's pretty much perfect, and his robot mode extras in this mode are very,
very minor-- you can see just a titch of his robot mode details inside
the (open) side windows, and on the back end you can see his front toes
poking out the bottom, but that's it. The mold sculpting is pretty accurate--
as you'd expect for a dude with a licensed car mode-- with the unique teeth-like
grill and vented back end looking pretty nice. The overall color scheme
is accurate to the movie, but in general this is bad thing when it comes
to Lockdown-- having almost all of the car mode be a rather dark grayish
brown-- even if it's semi-metallic-- just is not an exciting, eye-catching
color. Luckily the front windshield is painted silver, and the headlights
and rear vents are painted a rather nice shade of blue, both of which contrast
with the main color pretty well and the latter of which adds some much-needed
color to this mode. However, the paint app placements are also a victim
of Lockdown's 1-step transformation gimmick, as they make even more obvious
the gaps in the windshield and between the two halves of the rear. In fact,
this is my principle issue with this figure; in vehicle mode the parts
often don't quite tab together firmly, with the parts wiggling about slightly
here and there even during light play, transforming the figure a fraction
without you actually pressing the button on the windshield, which is what
actually triggers his transformation to robot mode. (To transform Lockdown
back, you simply push his roof back together again.)

    For robot mode, Lockdown
looks quite simple, and he is-- his doors and front grill move downwards
and out a bit, and his legs lengthen a bit while his roof moves back a
little further behind him so it doesn't get in the way as much. As one-step
transformations go, there's definitely more impressive ones out there.
However, the positive for this is that Lockdown doesn't really suffer from
proportional maladies in robot mode like some of the other toys in this
subline do; his arms are a bit slim and merely molded into the sides of
his doors, sure, and his vehicle kibble (his tires and shoulder-grill halves,
most obviously) could be tucked away a bit better, but he generally looks
like he does in the movie, with his face molded in the "mask down" position.
The amount of mold detailing on Lockdown is incredible, and definitely
the highlight of this mode; movie-accurate vents, pistons, and all sorts
of robotic detailing are everywhere. For articulation, he can only move
back-and-forth at the elbows, but articulation really isn't the point of
these toys, so I'm willing to give him a partial pass on this due to how
good the rest of this toy looks for a one-step changer. As far as colors
go, the coating of his main body in silver, the addition of several blue
paint apps on his body, and the lime-green on his mask really help to give
this mode considerably more color and make it more eye-catching than his
vehicle mode, with no large area looking dull.

    AoE "One-Step" Lockdown
may not have a very exciting transformation for a toy from the subline--
and I really wish his parts fit together more firmly in vehicle mode--
but, by and large, he's one of the best one-step changer designs in the
Age of Extinction toyline. He's pretty proportional in both modes, well-detailed,
and although he's barely poseable at all, the one-steps are for kids who
are young enough to generally not care about that kind of stuff anyways.
If you want a simple-changer of this design and don't want to spring for
the more-expensive, harder-to-find Flip 'n Change version, this toy makes
a nice substitute.
