    Insecticon's beast mode
is a robotic beetle. This mode is almost flawless, and I'd say it's probably
the best out of all of the Terrorcon's alternate modes. All of the legs
can move individually, albeit only at the point where they connect to the
body. But if there had been other joints in the legs, they most likely
wouldn't have supported Insecticon's weight, so I can see why this choice
was made. His proportions are excellent, so no problems there. His mold
and paint detailing is also great- you'd be hard-pressed to find a spot
on him without any little intricate "metal" detailing worked in, and the
paint patterns on his wings are very eye-pleasing. Speaking of his wings,
due to his transformation, they can open up, so if you want Insecticon
to spread his wings and "fly", you're easily able to do so (although the
legs can get in the way a little). The beetle face is probably the best
part of this mode, though. The little slanted eyes, complete with the jaw-trunk,
looks incredibly eeevil, and Insecticon's energon weapon mounted on his
forehead. In this mode, said energon weapon is a rotatable drill. It also
has a Minicon port on it for connecting to larger Transformers. One small
complaint, though, is that it IS hard to take the drill off without also
causing the Energon chip to pop off too, due to the two pieces' placement
so close to each other. The only other downside to this mode is that I'm
not too fond of Insecticon's yellow (although there's less of it visible
in this configuration than in his robot mode). It's not too bright, but
all of the basic Terrorcons are supposed to have white-and-green color
schemes, albeit with some variations. Where's Insecticon's white? Putting
an off-white color in place of the yellow would have worked better, in
my opinion, and made Insecticon fit in more with his fellow Terrorcons
at the same time.

    Insecticon's robot mode
is a biiig dissapointment when compared to his awesome insect mode. Almost
everything about it I don't like. First off, his articulation is horrid-
he can only move at the shoulders at two points, his hips, and he can rotate
his arms at the elbows. Granted, he's a small toy, but at this day and
age, not having basic knee and elbow articulation is definitely going to
get some major points knocked off. His proportions are an even bigger problem,
though. His head is too large proportionally, his chest too rectangular
and short, his arms too blocky and bulky, his waist too high up... I mean,
if you want to make a short and stocky transformer, fine, but make his
proportions to scale with him. Insecticon just looks way too abnormal and
is too obviously "toyish" in his proportions for my liking in this mode.
One thing that I do like about Insecticon's robot mode, though, is his
face detailing- I like the large horn above it, as it gives him more individuality,
and his mouth highly resembles that of an insect's. Not to mention he still
looks eeevil (although the yellow coloration here does hurt it some). I'm
also fond of the way two of his insect legs become shoulder-mounted guns
in this mode. It shows some creativity, since they're not just extras hanging
off his body like so many other insect Transformers. Insecticon's Energon
Weapon also shows its ingenuity in this mode as well- the drill splits
into both a sword and a gatling gun! (And yes, the gun can rotate, just
like the drill). It's really an ingenious little weapon- the best of the
Terrorcon's, I'd say. Insecticon's Decepticon spark crystal is on his chest.

    Insecticon's Energon
weapon is highly intuitive, and his beetle mode can't be beat. But his
robot mode is so awful it really tarnishes the entire toy- the proportions
and articulation are especially bad. As such, I'd say he's the least recommended
of the Terrorcons, even though I wouldn't say he's a downright bad toy,
due to his insect mode.

      Insecticon is a merciless Terrorcon
who declares allegiance only to himself. He possesses a powerful arsenal
of Energon weapons in both robot and insect mode. His infamous battle tactics
are feared by both Autobots and Decepticons alike, though few of his opponents
have survived to speak of them. His enemies are advised to avoid the swarm
of Insecticon.
