    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Voyager Leobreaker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Voyager Leobreaker

     Unlike the
     <a href="leoprime.html">
      Classics
Legends figure
     </a>
     , this version of Leo Prime doesn't share a color scheme
that's an homage to Beast Wars II Lioconvoy-- instead, Universe 2.0 Leo
Prime shares a color scheme with, well... pretty much any Optimus Prime.
The red is more of an orangish hue, so it's quite believable as a main
color and looks quite good. The dark blue is a nice contrast color
     <i>
      in
theory
     </i>
     , but in practice having a lion with blue lower legs just looks
really silly, though admittedly less so considering the technorganic nature
of Leo Prime's beast mode. The silver and gray serve as nice secondary
accent colors for both the orangish-red and blue-- particularly on the
mane-- but the color scheme is pretty "been there, done that" overall.
A new accent color added to the mix-- like, say, a touch of light green--
might have made Leo Prime a bit more eye-catching. A rather odd point about
this toy is that the box and figure have an Autobot symbol on it, but the
bio on the back, as well as the Beast Wars fiction itself, labels him a
Maximal.

     Leo Prime has one mold
change-- the head in robot mode has been re-done, and is now rather Prime-like
but more slender and feline. It's quite a nice headsculpt, and not only
that, it's smaller than Cybertron Leobreaker's, meaning Leo Prime can turn
his head all the way around at the neck in robot mode! Nifty! The electronics
have also been taken out of Leo Prime to keep the toy at a Voyager price
point while still accounting for inflation.

     If you're looking for
a version of this mold that will look good combined with
     <a href="cyprime.html">
      Cybertron
Leader Optimus Prime
     </a>
     , look no further than this toy-- their color schemes
are very similar, so they'll go together great. If you want to get the
toy solely based on its own color scheme, though, try the Target Exclusive
release of this mold or
     <a href="nembreaker.html">
      Nemesis Breaker
     </a>
     --
as it is, this one is a bit too cliche by now and doesn't suit a lion all
that well, technorganic or no.

       Leo Prime is a career soldier, commander
of an elite Maximal black ops unit designated the Pack. So secret is his
unit, even most of those in the Maximal command structure are aware of
it only as a rumor. Leo Prime and his comrades in the Pack travel wherever
trouble is thickest, often working undercover to deal crippling blows to
Predacon plots.
