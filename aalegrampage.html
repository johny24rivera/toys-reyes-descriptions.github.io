    This version of Rampage
doesn't combine like the

     other
    </a>
    Legends
class version, but on the plus side it's released in the proper movie-accurate
colors the first time around. The orange-red and black go together decently
well, though they're not mind-blowing. The silver "worn metal" paint on
the shovel is a nice touch, though, and there isn't too large a stretch
of any one color in this mode, even if it's two-tone for the most part.
The proportions are generally pretty accurate, although the cockpit looks
a little funky-shaped due to it becoming the feet in robot mode. The ends
of the claw-hands also stick out from the rear of this mode a bit, but
otherwise there's no robot mode extras in this mode at all.

    Rampage's robot mode
is definitely a more accurate representation of his onscreen persona this
time around, given that this time he doesn't also have to worry about combining.
The body is proportioned MUCH better, although the claws are hugely oversized.
The snake-leg is also a tad undersized, though not nearly as obviously
misproportioned as the hands, that's for sure. The snake-leg can either
be left together or seperated for a more traditional two-leg stance, but
regardless if you look at Rampage from the side in this mode, you can see
how much the pelvis sticks out from the main body-- it's really unsightly,
makes him a bit more unbalanced than he would have been, and is definitely
my main complaint about this mode. Another downside is the fairly restrictive
articulation, even for a Legend-- he can move at the shoulders (at two
points), hips, and at a point about two-thirds down his snake-legs. That's
it, and most of those points are in one direction-- the arms are particularly
restricted, though I suppose if you're getting the Legends class toy the
articulation isn't your main concern. As far as the detailing goes, he's
got some fairly nice detailing on the face/chest and arms, though it's
not outright impressive as many of the Movieverse Legends. The silver paint
detailing on many of the robot parts helps to add a bit to the otherwise
two-tone color scheme, but some on the hands really would've helped vary
things up a bit more.

    The non-combining Legends
class Rampage is simplistic while still giving you a robot mode that doesn't
look overly crummy. It's certainly got downsides-- bad articulation, some
weird propoirtions-- but if you want a fairly clean, easy-to-transform
Rampage that doesn't have bunch of junk hanging off of him in robot mode
like the
