    Beast mode is a black
ant. Although this repaint's color scheme does, in my opinion, look slightly
better than
    <a href="inferno.html">
     Inferno's
    </a>
    , it still doesn't stand
up any better in beast mode. It still sags on its legs a lot, and its back
and front legs are bulky somewhat. The middle ant legs can snap off somewhat
easily, too, and the detailing is only so-so in this mode. Articulation
is great, though, as the mouth, antennae, and front and back legs can all
move.

    Robot mode is extremely
wicked-looking, even for a Predacon. Her body is almost entirely black
and lavender, with some silver showing on the head and guns. Her face has
the same demonic grin that Inferno's does, which adds to the wickedness
of this toy even more. Her two guns are nicely crafted as well, but the
only drawback is one doesn't really fire anything. One of her guns is her
ant pincers and antennae stuck together, and the other is a missle launcher;
the ammo is on her legs. Her ant bulb opens up to reveal her turbine engines,
giving her the gift of flight as well as fright. Again, like Inferno, her
waist hinges don't fit together well, and her middle legs and bulb get
in the way some.

    A very nice repaint;
I didn't think they could make anything more demonic-looking than Inferno,
but they did.

      Antagony is somewhat of an enigma. Soon
after her mysterious arrival on the Beast Wars planet, she displayed the
uncanny ability to accurately predict significant events. She explains
away her clairvoyance as more intuition, but the other Predacons feel it
is something more than that - almost as if she's from a time yet to be.
Her prowess in battle is further enhanced by the ability to project limited-duration
hard light holograms that serve to confuse her opponents. Antagony's primary
weapon fires bolts of corrosive acid which instantly begins to dissolve
Maximal armor upon impact.
