    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Plasma Punch Bumblebee.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Plasma Punch Bumblebee

     Pulse Blast Bumblebee
isn't so much a repaint of his original FAB version as a slight "updating".
He still has the usual black &amp; yellow color scheme, with the same deco
job in vehicle mode and a fairly similar one in robot mode. The most obvious
changes have to do with his remolding. For one, his head mold has been
changed to be more movie-accurate, what with the bigger "pupils" 'n such.
The othe rmold change has to do with his chest/hood pieces, which have
been remolded to resemble the actual Camaro model that Bumblebee now is
in the ROTF movie. (Those pieces can still angle downwards in robot mode,
however-- the robot mode pic above is transformed slightly wrong in that
aspect.) As far as the colors go, Bumblebee has a slightly "lighter" color
scheme overall, with the yellow being more of a dull yellow as opposed
to a slightly brighter "cheese" yellow this time around, and the paint
for the windows is a bit lighter as well. His interior robot parts-- his
waist, upper legs, and lower arms-- are also now gray instead of black,
which is odd because that's actually LESS movie accurate, but whatever,
at least it gives him a bit more color variety. More paint app have been
switched from his waist and hips to his head due to the increased detail,
and his blaster &amp; missile are not a light orange instead of a dull
blue, which actually works better, particularly for the missile (and it's
easy to think of the mouth of the blast as heated metal).

     Pulse Blast Bumblebee
is a recommended pickup for the young Bumblebee fan who didn't get a toy
of him from the orignal TF Movie line, as it's fairly solid for a FAB,
but for anyone else it's not worth it, as the changes aren't substantial
enough.

       With more and more Decepticons popping
up all over the world, its a good thing Bumblebee has stayed in fighting
shape. The evil robots may be skilled at hiding, but they can only hide
for so long before theyll have to face Bumblebee and his plasma cannon!
