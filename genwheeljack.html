    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Turbo
Tracks. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     Wheeljack used the Turbo
Tracks mold as a basis, but it's heavily modified-- which we'll get to
shortly. Firstly, let's cover the colors-- white, gray, and black work
as a basic color scheme, but what really catches the eye are Wheeljack's
nifty red and green stripes on his car mode, which not only REALLY pop
but-- even with so many TFs released since his original G1 toy-- is still
a pretty unique color scheme. The green plastic visible in robot mode adds
to his color scheme in a similar manner. Wheeljack also has a substantial
number of silver paint apps (again, particularly prevalent in robot mode),
which almost always makes for a nice accent color. The dark metallic gunmetal
gray paint on some parts like his rear windshield works even better, though,
in contrast against the white-- though the tradeoff for this is it's not
as distinguishable against the black. One color change that I'm NOT fond
of on this toy is the lightening up of the tinted clear plastic on the
windshields, which makes the robot parts inside a bit more visible than
on Turbo Tracks (especially since some of them are white).

     Wheeljack's mold changes
are pretty prevalent, and were all built into the mold before it was even
first manufactured as Tracks-- I LOVE it when Hasbro plans ahead like that.
For one, there's been a spoiler added to the rear of his car mode, and
the front bumper has been elongated a bit, helping the alt mode be a closer
match to the original G1 toy's. Obviously, the head has also been remolded,
and is a pretty faithful reproduction of Wheeljack's head-- no complaints
here, except his light piping doesn't work quite as well as I'd like. The
tips of the "wing" pieces have also been changed to a flatter, wider appearance,
to better match G1 Wheeljack's robot mode and keep them from being so obviously
wing tips like they were meant to be on Turbo Tracks. In addition, the
two shoulder-mounted cannons have been changed to look more like exhaust
pipes on vehicle mode-- but one of the best parts of this remolding is,
they don't ONLY work as shoulder-mounted cannons in robot mode-- Wheeljack
can hold them as wrenches, with the C-clips on the "weapons" serving as
the wrench heads (which fits his engineer characterization)! That was simply
an INGENIOUS piece of work there, especially considering that the handheld
gun from Turbo Tracks is meant to be plugged behind one of Wheeljack's
shoulders to imitate the way his weapons were located on his G1 toy. The
remolding of the weapons, though one of the more minor changes, is definitely
my favorite of the remolded pieces. Last but not least, a couple of minor
pieces have been changed in the legs to make Wheeljack's transformation
slightly different from Tracks'-- now the front of the car hood halves
serve as the front of Wheeljack's feet, instead of the back like on Tracks.
It's a small change, but it helps make them look even more different, and
each more accurate to their relative G1 toys. That said, as part of this
slight transformation mod, the legs don't extend outwards quite as much
during transformation, which-- combined with the legs that appear bulkier--
makes Wheeljack look significantly more of a "chubster" than Tracks, given
the mold's rather short, skinny arms. (This modification doesn't change
Wheeljack's articulation compared to Tracks'.)

     Generations Wheeljack
is a great, fitting update to the G1 character and an ingenious reuse of
a mold that, with a few slight modifications, works well for BOTH characters
it was originally meant for. The weapon "mods" are also simply ingenious.
The color scheme is considerably more eye-catching than Tracks' overall,
but on the other hand, the stubbier, chubbier-looking legs in robot mode
are an additional tick against Wheeljack. Thus, overall I'd put both Wheeljack
and Turbo Tracks on the same level as far as a recommendation-- that is,
I highly recommend them both, but for slightly different reasons.

       Wheeljack is a brilliant risk taker,
both in his lab and on the road. His inventions are both the cause of and
solution to many problems as he pushes the boundaries of science and engineering
in his quest for the next big thing. Due to the daring nature of his experiments,
his lab needs to remain isolated-- mostly because it blows up on a regular
basis.
