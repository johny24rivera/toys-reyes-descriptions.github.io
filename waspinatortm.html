    Beast mode is a metallic
wasp. This beast mode looks a lot better than the original Waspinators
beast mode, but that isn't saying a whole lot. His insect legs won't hold
him up, and his back insect legs are clearly his robot legs, as they're
much thicker than the other four. Still, the color combo is pretty good,
as is the detailing. The jet cockpit for the vehicle mode also clearly
sticks out of the bottom of the wasp head.

    Vehicle mode is a bee-plane.
This isnt much of a vehicle mode- a jet cockpit just flips out of his
mouth and his wings bend and fold to resemble a jets wings. There is also
a lot of extras on the bottom, especially his insect legs.

    Robot mode is okay,
except there is no locking mechanism, so his bee chest can be in several
different places around the chest area. His insect legs stick out in this
mode and get in the way. His face looks almost the same as the original
except for the colors.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Not particularly great
in any of its modes; the worst Transmetal, in my opinion, but still an
okay transformer overall.

      After the quantum surge, Waspinator
became a meched-out, armored wasp with the ability to change into a fighter-jet
as well as a bio-genetically enhanced robot. His personality, however,
did not change much; hes still high-tempered, aggressive and dangerous
when angered. Only now Waspinator is faster, armed with a toxic stinger
and more driven in his mission to wipe out the Maximals forever!
