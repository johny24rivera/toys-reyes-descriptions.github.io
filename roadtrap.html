    Roadtrap's vehicle mode
is a 4WD vehicle, and... well, there's definitely two halves to this mode.
The front half looks excellent; great proportions (well, it's maybe a TITCH
too wide), no kibble, and generally a solid-looking front end. The back
end? Errrr... well, I mean it's got wheels on the bottom, so that's good.
But the top half clearly has the robot chest details on it; I mean, they're
not really even attempted to be hidden. Given that Roadtrap is part of
a new character, couldn't they have designed a chest for him that kinda
looked like the back half of a truck, or that could turn around or something?
(For those unaware, Battletrap was a "Duocon" in G1, which meant that he
was two separate vehicles that combined into a single robot mode. This
time around, Hasbro has released each vehicle with its own separate robot
mode, as well as a combined mode resembling Battletrap's original robot
mode-- this combined robot mode is reviewed in the other PotP Duocon, Battleslash's,
review.) The back end also widens out too much for a 4WD vehicle, and there's
no real back end to the vehicle either-- just the folded-up combined mode
waist and upper legs sticking out at a diagonal angle. It's really a shame,
as it really ruins quite a lot of this mode, given how the back half is
just robot parts. I understand that this $10 toy has to form both a vehicle,
a robot, AND the bottom half of another robot, but it seems like this still
could have been implemented better. The mold detailing on the toy is fairly
basic by Generations standards, with mostly smooth detailing on the front
section, though with some stuff like the front bumper/headlights/winch
detailed in, as well as simple details for the windows and treaded tires.
The back end just has some angular details here and there, with a few vents
used for the robot mode. Even though almost all of Roadtrap's plastic is
a fairly medium blue shade, there's enough paint apps in this mode to keep
it from looking too bland. There's some light red on the windows, which
contrasts excellently with the blue, as well as black on the tires and
across the waist of the robot mode on top. There's silver paint ont he
front grill, and some yellow on the headlights and on the robot abs. There's
also some rather unique white line-and-dot detailing on the robot chest,
with a Decepticon symbol painted on the right side. Although I do wish
the winch had been painted or perhaps the hubs of the wheels, overall Roadtrap's
scheme is varied enough in this mode and looks good.

    To transform Roadtrap
to his individual robot mode, you flip the rear sides around to become
his arms and then split apart the entire body into almost two. Then you
fold up/compress the front sections and point them up, while pushing down
only the lower sections of the legs, while the upper sections of the legs--
used for the combined mode-- are hidden behind the chest that clips together
in front of them, leaving only the head perched on top of what becomes
the waist piece for Battletrap. Roadtrap's robot mode is a little squat
in its proportions, but generally looks pretty good, and definitely far
better than his vehicle mode. There is a bit of a noticeable gap between
the sides of his head and where the sides of his body begin, simply due
to him also having to form the bottom half of a larger TF. The way his
shoulders come out from the sides of the chest also looks a little odd
because of the connectors, and I think the tires would've looked better
on the outside of the upper arms compared to the insides. His lower arms
are merely molded into the inside of the pieces that become part of the
lower rear portion of the vehicle mode, but beyond a little piece sticking
out of the bottom they look pretty good with the black fists, and I like
the faux light red taillights on the upper arms. Combine these details
with all the other paint in this mode, and the color breakup looks even
better compared to the truck mode-- absolutely no large, unpainted blue
areas here. All of those chest details seen in vehicle mode carry over
to this mode, only with a bit of silver on the top more visible, and they
look great. The headsculpt has a blue helmet with small side antennae on
it and vents on the forehead and the sides of the chin, while he also has
a light red visor and a silver, "normal" face with a grumpy look to it
and a strong chin-- overall, a pretty decent headsculpt. I love how the
front section of the vehicle mode compresses to form his feet, but man,
they are big clunkers-- he basically has no lower legs, just upper legs,
knees, and then those big feet. (This is primarily what contributes to
his "squat" look.) Of course, due to his very wide feet, he also has excellent
stability. As for articulation in this mode, he can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows, hips, and knees, with most of those on ball joints, so he's fairly
poseable.

    Roadtrap is the weaker
of the two PotP Duocons, as half of his vehicle mode is BARELY a vehicle
at all, showing obvious robot parts all along that back section. He's also
a little squat and has some minor downsides in robot mode, though they're
nothing compared to the vehicle mode issues. I like the bit of originality
here in making each component of Battletrap its own unique Transformer,
but I feel they could've done a bit better with Roadtrap, all things considered.
Still, if you want to form Battletrap, you kinda need him.
