      First off, just as a
side note I hate Beet-Chit's name. (Seriously, just say it. Sounds like
you're cursing.) I know it follows the Diaclone Japanese Waruder name conventions
to some extent, but it's still just a horrible name. Regardless, Beet-Chit
contrasts against the rest of this set by being almost entirely blue, with
the only red being on his optic strip. Unfortunately, particularly in beast
mode, there's little paint beyond this blue-- but luckily, it's a really
nice shade of blue and looks good almost by itself-- certainly on a toy
that's this small. There's at least a bit of white in beast mode, though,
used on the little details at the back of the head-- they look good, but
I wish there were a few more of them. In robot mode there's a good amount
of silver paint on the chest and head, which goes well with the blue as
a secondary color and also looks pretty nice. Because of the plastic type,
the handle in the middle of the chest is just a bland light gray, but there's
not much of it.

        Spy-Eye is the odd 'bot
out here, not a part of the Waruder duo but a sort of "partner robot" to
the Diaclone toys in the other attendee exclusive sets for BotCon 2015.
That said, his color scheme is mostly a "side-effect" of Zaptrap's. The
light gray is in completely the same places as on Generations Reflector,
and the black paint is MOSTLY in the same places-- that is, on the top
rear section of the camera mode. However, the black paint ISN'T on the
camera lens unlike on Reflector, which is a bit of a downer, and quite
honestly the only reason his rating is lower than Reflector's-- there's
too much unbroken gray in camera mode. The purple paint and plastic from
Reflector has been replaced with a normal red plastic, which contrasts
just as well with the black and gray on Spy-Eye. The neat little extra
bit that helps this color scheme pop more is the bit of light sky blue
on Spy-Eye's chest and optic strip, which contrasts VERY well against the
red plastic it's surrounded by. I wish it was used on the faux camera lens
on the robot chest, though, just to give the toy a few more paint apps
to make it look more "premium", like most FunPub toys.

          Zaptrap is based off
of
          <a href="g1insecticons.html">
           G1 Shrapnel's
          </a>
          original release in the
Diaclone line before Transformers ever existed. As you can see, the main
difference here is that Skrapnel's purple has been replaced with a fairly
straightforward shade of red, along with some red paint on the robot chest
to boot. The black and light milky gray are in the same places as they
are on the original Generations Skrapnel figure. As a whole, I think the
red contrasts against the black slightly better than the purple on Skrapnel,
though with the gray-- and the black in particular-- being in the same
exact places as on Skrapnel, I can see why FunPub made this the "Primus
Pregistrant-Only" exclusive-- its appeal is probably a bit more limited
than the "complete" redecos for BotCon 2015. That said, the colors ARE
accurate to the source material, so I can hardly blame them for keeping
the black and gray the same. What helps this color scheme pop a little
more is the pretty nice shade of light sky blue used on the insect abdomen,
robot shoulders, and robot pelvis-- it contrasts excellently with both
the red and black, and provides a nice "foil" color to all the red. There's
also a touch of orangish yellow paint on the lower leg details in robot
mode, which contrasts against the black well and also complements the red
nicely, andsome silver paint on the robot face.

            What one race sees as invasion, rampant
destruction, and peril, Zaptrap and his pilot, Beet-Chit, see as only lunch.
Skillful pursuers, elder members of the hive, and proven foragers, the
connate duo are still, however, as one-minded and instinctual as the rest
of the brood. They rely little on tactics and schemes as they simply organize
swarms to overcome any opposition as they seek their true and only goal:
food. With jaws capable of ripping apart even the hardest of metals, Zaptrap's
digestive systems then process the consumed material and use it as fuel.
Beet-Chit siphons what energy he requires and in return provides guidance
and brainpower to the larger insect who possesses limited AI of his own.

            In his beetle form, Zaptrap uses the
40,000-volt bursts from his horns to disable opponents. After converting
to robot mode, he has access to devastating grenade launchers and gamma
ray detonators. Beet-Chit himself is equipped with a pair of razor-sharp
mandibles that can be used as an offensive weapon if called upon. It is
rumored that if the smaller insect is ever removed from Zaptrap, the larger
unit would instantly disintegrate. This rumor has never been corroborated
with fact.

            This 3-pack is probably
the most easily forgettable/uninspiring of the BotCon 2015 exclusives.
I understand the homages, but I get why this was only given out 1 per Primus
package Preregistrant, and as such commands a fairly heavy price on the
secondary market. The colors chosen are pretty decent, but Spy-Eye and
Zaptrap look a bit too similar to Reflector and Skrapnel. This would have
been more forgivable if this was a regular-priced store exclusive, but
as BotCon exclusives I would've expected a bit more, even given the source
material. Beet-Chit is certainly different enough and has a nice base color,
but could've used a few more paint apps. In general these molds have decent
paint jobs, but just not as memorable or unique as most BotCon exclusives.
