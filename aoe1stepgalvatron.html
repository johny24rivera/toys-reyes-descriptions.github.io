    Galvatron's Argosy Freightliner
alt mode makes it pretty decently to the 1-step changer size, with the
proportions being more-or-less on-point. There are two notable exceptions
here, though; for one, the rear endhas overly tall rear bumpers, an obvious
side effect of them becoming the robot feet. Also, there's a big obvious
black tab sticking out behind the back end of the cab portion, which is
used for the transformation. The colors here are pretty much the same as
on the other AoE Galvatron figures, with a dark milky bluish gray forming
the main color-- and for a gray, it looks pretty decent, with a bit of
milky shine to it that makes it more interesting than your average gray.
There's also some black on the front bumper, front windows (but not the
side windows), and wheels, and a bit of regular milky gray on the back
end of the cab, which becomes much more prevalent in robot mode. The paint
apps on Galvatron are pretty nice on the front part-- with the aforementioned
black windows and grill, as well as silver stripes along the sides-- but
the back end of this mode desperately needs some paint apps to break up
all that milky bluish gray, especially with some details like a trailer
hitch molded in back there. I feel that putting a big purple Decepticon
symbol on the right side of the cab was a mistake, as it blends in too
well with the gray and could've been used for some more paint-- say, for
the side windows, or to make the silver paint a bit more extensive like
it is on the

    Galvatron's transformation
is rather cool-- it involves pushing down on the aforementioned black tab
behind the cab a little and then rotating the whole roof of the cab around,
which causes the feet to split apart, the arms to flip out, the chest to
flip down, and then the cab just hides behind Galvatron's back as you stand
him up for robot mode. Granted, the cab in the back is a BIG extra, but
it doesn't stick out too much from any angles approaching the front, and
his large heels keep Galvatron from toppling over easily. My main issue
with this mode is just how off the proportions are-- the legs and head
are okay, but the chest is WAY too wide and the arms WAY too skinny. Galvatron
needs to stop eating fast food every day, it's not good for him. As the
bad guy "leader", he should look menacing, but he honestly just looks rather
ridiculous in this mode with these proportions. Additionally, his chest
panel which folds down in this mode doesn't QUITE sit flush with the surrounding
parts, sticking out just a titch at the bottom. It's a minor downside,
to be sure, but still notable. On the plus side, the mold detailing, while
adequate in vehicle mode, is great in this mode, with details like the
"chest grinder", curved metallic details on the hips and legs, and some
details on his arms molded quite well. The headsculpt is particularly well-done,
capturing his movie head pretty darned nicely, with an appropriate scowl
on his silver face, with bronze eyes and a dark metallic blue spot on his
forehead. The added colors also make this mode more attractive as far as
the scheme goes, with the dark metallic blue on the arms and lower legs,
silver on the hips and waist, and metallic bronze on the chest grinder
all helping to diversify up the color scheme considerably-- which it really
needs, given how much more prevalent the boring "regular" gray is in this
mode, being the plastic color for his head, chest, and arms. For articulation,
Galvatron can move back-and-forth at the shoulders, and that's it. I know
1-step changers weren't made for articulation, but I don't see how, given
the transformation, simple knee and/or elbow articulation could have hurt.

    The 1-step version of
    <i>
     Age
of Extinction
    </i>
    Galvatron is the weakest version of him. The vehicle
mode is alright, and the transformation is interesting and unique, but
the robot mode-- despite the nice mold and paint detailing-- looks ridiculous
with its tiny little arms and huge, wide chest. If you're looking for a
simpler-to-transform version of this design, I'd go with the Power Battler
version instead.
