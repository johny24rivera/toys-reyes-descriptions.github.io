    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Snow Cat. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Snow Cat

     Although Snow Cat is
more of an actual REPAINT when compared to his fellow exclusive
     <a href="unidownshift.html">
      Downshift
     </a>
     ,
it still suffers from one absolutely fatal flaw-- there are almost zero
paint apps on this figure. The wheel paint apps have been kept, as well
as the visor paint app and a new striped paint app added to the bottom
of his skis, but that's it. Even his Decepticon symbol is no longer painted!
He looks absolutely prototypish because of this, which is a shame because
the black-orange color scheme isn't that bad. The orange could stand to
be of a slightly less obnoxious hue, but it's not too bad. I also would've
liked if they had changed the color of the transparent plastic from the
original Snow Cat, as maybe a transparent light orange would've looked
better than the blue-green with this color combo.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe Snow Cat is
another crummy exclusive that even completists should think twice about
purchasing-- although his color scheme is satisfactory, he has almost NO
paint apps, and given that he's sold at inflated KB Toys prices, there's
really no reason to get him instead of Energon Snow Cat.

         Snowcat's new colorscheme
is pretty bad. I mean, To be honest, I would rather have a more G.I. JOE
accurate paintscheme, in which they would have 3 to choose from. The first
would be plain white with light trans purple and brown camo, like the original
vehicle. The second would be a more gray colorscheme, and the last would
be blue. So, what do we get? Safety Orange, Black, and the trans blue.
Wow. Barely any paint detailing as well. If the trans plastic had been
trans orange and the safety orange changed to purple, it might be worthy
of being called decent. But alas, that's not the case. Pass unless you
are a completist or fan of the mold.

            Long since thought destroyed in the
final collapse of Unicron, Snow Cat somehow managed to survive, and has
been in hiding in the ruins of Kaon since then. Driven mad by his loss
of purpose since the disappearance of Megatron, he roams the southern polar
regions of Cybertron attacking anyone he sees, and boosting away before
his targets can counter-attack.
