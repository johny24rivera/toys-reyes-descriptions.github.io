    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Drift. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Drift

     Blurr here is a bit difficult
to qualify, that he differs from all versions of the character in at least
a minor manner. He's CLOSEST to IDW comics' Blurr-- he's much more ornamental
and modern in appearance than "traditional" G1 Blurr-- but parts of the
robot mode and car mode still don't quite match up. Still, it's a fairly
close approximation given he's been remolded from a completely different
character who wasn't even meant to be the same design, and the toy itself
works quite well as "a" Blurr. Blurr's traditional color scheme of various
shades of blue carries over to this toy, and I particularly like how it
all looks in vehicle mode-- the dark blue on the sides working up to a
moderately light blue plastic, followed on the top by a very light shade
of blue on top and a stream of off-white paint down the center of most
of the vehicle. They all go together remarkbaly well and make him quite
eye-catching. (It should be noted for the perfectionists, however, that
with all the long lines of paint on the vehicle mode, it can be a bit difficult
to find a toy where all the paint lines match up JUST right.) Blurr also
has a bit of black used for some of his robot parts, which serves as a
nice dark color to contrast against the others.

     Blurr has some fairly
significant remolding down-- most obvious is the face, which is now pretty
much his more ornamental IDW head down to a tee-- it looks great and is
very well-detailed and sculpted. The spoiler has also been significantly
reduced from the Drift version of the mold, and is barely one at all now
in car mode-- a bit of an afterthought, and honestly I don't think this
version looks quite as good, particularly unpainted as it is. Drift's swords
have been replaced with guns for Blurr-- like Drift, he can hold his two
smaller guns in his hip holsters, while a super-long sniper rifle can clip
into his upper back. A really nice idea, changing up the weapons-- though
it should be made clear that the door hip pieces are remolded too to keep
their weapons snug in their holders-- you CANNOT put Blurr's guns in Drift's
sword sheathes or visa versa.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Generations Blurr is
an excellent repaint of an excellent mold, and his remoldings are (for
the most part) an improvement over Drift's, especially the weapons which
are no longer bendy, rubbery plastic. Highly recommend, and recommended
slightly over Generations Drift.

       There are those who suppose, based on
his high-speed history and fast-talking demeanor, that Blurr lacks patience.
Those people are wrong. He appears to be always on the move because he
always has somewhere he needs to be-- delivering a sensitive data packet,
or a round of electro-laser fire to a Decepticon squad. When he must wait,
he can do so in absolute silence and stillness for hours, until his target
is centered in his crosshairs.
