    Beast mode is a hammerhead
shark, with a beautiful fading color scheme. Very nice, with no obvious
clue hes a robot, except that his legs sort of stick out on his bottom
side. There are practically no movable parts in this mode except for the
front fins, which is kind of drag, but this is to be expected from a sea
creature such as this.

    Robot mode is very good,
too, but his shark halves stick out a bit and interfere. His face looks
more like that of a Predacons than a Maximals. His shark face can pop
out of his missle launcher and he can hold it, but this doesnt seem to
serve any purpose. He can shoot missles out of his belly. His metallic-shark
belly looks very nice, and his tail scythe is cool-looking.

    A nice-looking transformer,
but with somewhat of a lot of extras in robot mode. His detailing is also
only so-so.

      Just when the Predacons thought it was
safe to go back in the water... Cybershark rises to the surface for a fearsome
feeding frenzy! Like a turbo-charged torpedo speeding through the sea,
Cybershark searches the ocean depths for Predacon enemies. Upon finding
the enemy he launches his robotic hammerhead to knock'em out cold, then
finishes the job in robot mode by filleting his prey with his switch blade
tail!
