    Vehicle mode is a bullet
train. This mode is the best-looking vehicle of the three Trainbots'- the
only extra is the top of the robot feet on the backside. Also, he cracks
between the plastic pieces are nearly as obvious as they are on the other
two Trainbots. Rapid Run's weapon also doesn't stick out that much from
his backside, and it's just long enough so that you can hook other the
other trains to the back of him. (He also has a hole on the bottom of his
front side so that he can connect to the other Trainbots as well.) This
mode just looks real nice- my only complaint about it would really be that,
like most of the other vehicle TFs, the only moving parts in this mode
are the small wheels on the underside.

    Although the robot mode
isn't quite as good as the vehicle mode, it's still really neat. Like
    <a href="railspike.html">
     Railspike
    </a>
    ,
Rapid Run's legs are large proportionally, but not too much, like it unfortunately
is with
    <a href="midnightexpress.html">
     Midnight Express
    </a>
    . The only problem
I have with the legs is that front a head-on view, they look very odd and
skiny-looking. Rapid Run's gun is pretty weird-looking, but hey, at least
it does its job. It's a standard missile launcher with a very wide, flat
top. Some people may view the large train front used for Rapid Run's chest
as a rather large extra, but I think it adds a bit of character and uniqueness
to Rapid Run's mold- I just wish it didn't stick out QUITE so much, but
it's no big deal. However, Rapid Run's flaps of plastic that connect his
main body to his arms don't connect to anything on the sides of the chest
in this mode, so there's a slight gap in between the chest and the arm
plates, which doesn't really look that good. From a side view, there's
also a rather unsightly gap between the lower part of his chest and his
waist. Thankfully, the train wheels keep this from being obvious from any
other view. Rapid Run's robot head is very well done, and is the most different
of the Trainbot's- he has a faceplate instead of a mouth, and the main
colors used are silver and gold. He also has what looks like a miniature
front of a train on his forehead too, which is a neat touch. Rapid Run
is also very posable- his arms and legs all have pretty much unhindered
posability, and he's the ony Trainbot who can turn his waist.

    Despite a few minor
faults in robot mode, Rapid Run is a great toy- my favorite of the Trainbots.
He's rather small for a Mega, however, and should have been deluxe-sized.
A great toy, though- a must-buy!

      Rapid Run is proud of being the toughest
member of the Bullet Train team. He is always ready for a fight and loves
a good brawl. He fires his grenade launcher to confuse the enemy with a
blinding wall of smoke, so that his fellow Autobots can send in the heavy
weapons. His aim is always accurate, so he never has to fire more than
once.

      Review by Beastbot
     </font>
     <p>
      *Pictured above is the "unpainted windows" variant of Rapid Run, which
was only seen during the first batch released into stores. Soon afterwards,
Hasbro painted the train windows sky blue, and this makes the train mode
look more detailed, but unfortunately, the sky blue rather clashes with
the light grey a bit, so the negatives and positives sort of cancel each
other out for that addition.
