    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Prowl.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Prowl

     Bluestreak-- as you'd
expect-- takes his colors and look fairly strictly from his
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      G1
version
     </a>
     . His primary color is a dull milky gray here-- he's not coated
in silver paint, unfortunately-- but it doesn't look outright blah, like
most light gray plastic does on Transformers. It's a bit duller and has
a certain "gleam" to it that's not metallic-- it's a bit hard to explain
if you can't see it in person, but it does look alright. A large patch
of dark gray covers much of his vehicle mode, which, along with the duller
silvery-blue windows, means that you don't find much contrast in that mode,
though at least the two shades of gray complement each other. In robot
mode, he gets more interesting-looking, with the light red paint on his
headcrest and upper legs really contrasting nicely with the otherwise monochrome
color scheme and drawing the eyes. Having his head and lower arms painted
helps break up all the milky gray plastic as well, though there's more
dark gray plastic visible in this mode, which-- though G1-accurate-- just
doesn't look as good as the red. He's generally well-covered in these paint
apps, but a few spots in his vehicle mode that I would consider "essential"
are unpainted-- namely, his headlights, tailights, and front grill, which
is unfortunate.

     Bluestreak has a few
mold changes when compared to Prowl. First, Prowl's siren has been removed
and replaced with a piece that fits in with the rest of Bluestreak's roof--
as is the case with pretty much all of the Prowl-to-Bluestreak redecos.
However, Bluestreak also comes with his signature gun, unlike Prowl-- a
definite plus, as it's always nice to give these little guys their own
weapons. The mold's hands have been redone so that Bluestreak can carry
this or any other Cyberverse-compatible weapon in robot mode, and little
holes have also been made on the sides of the car doors so that he can
hold the weapon on one side in that mode, as well.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "GDO" Bluestreak is
pretty much a no-brainer of a redeco. I wish his light red was a bit more
prevalent-- particularly in vehicle mode, G1-accurate or not-- as his vehicle
mode doesn't have enough visual interest behind it and is lacking a few
minor paint apps, in my opinion. I think Prowl's vehicle mode color-wise
looks a bit better than Bluestreak's, but in turn I think Bluestreak's
robot mode looks a bit better than Prowl's. What puts Bluestreak over the
"edge" when comparing the two in terms of his overall rating is his addition
of a gun accessory, which Prowl did not have. If you like Legion-class
toys, this is a recommended purchase-- it's a decent redeco of a better-than-average
Legion mold, if not at all surprising or intuitive.

       Bluestreak hates war, but he hates the
Decepticons even more. With his home city destroyed at the command of Megatron,
he has nothing to return to, and nothing to lose. His constant, good-natured
talking hides the pain and loss he only releases in combat.
