    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron deluxe class
Thunderblast. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron

     Think that Transformers
has gotten way too "manly"? Think we need way less gigantic, dull-colored
brutes and more hot pink girly-girl toys in a line all about big metallic
death machines killing each other? Well, then Elita-1's right up your alley!
She's PINK. Pink pink pink pink pink. Granted, her G1 version wasn't exactly
NOT pink, but the colors were more... subdued than in this Botcon update
of her. (For the record, just like her pack-mate Razorclaw, Elita-1 is
part of a "Botcon 5th-Anniversary-since-the-current-guys-took-over" extra
exclusive set, covering unused exclusive ideas from previous years. This
idea came from the Botcon 2007 "Games of Decepticon" comic.) Both of her
main colors are pink shades that are pretty purely pink, without any colors
in there to "dilute" the girly-ness. The dull pink is particularly loud,
in a really saturated kind of way. The black used for the top of her vehicle
mode makes it more stomachable for me in that mode, and the transparent
blue also is a nice secondary color used for the windshield and missiles.
The light blue works well with the black, but once you get to robot mode
and you lose all that extra dark coloration, Elita-1 just becomes waaay
too girly for a Transformer toy, in my opinion. And even ignoring that,
pink and pink just doesn't work well as an overall color scheme. If she
looked more in 'bot mode like she does in vehicle mode, I wouldn't have
that big of a problem with her-- she really just needs some dark colors
in there to help with contrast. Her paint apps to be a bit too weighted
to the vehicle mode as well, as her robot mode is pretty un-painted compared
to her boat form.

     No mold changes have
been made to Elita-1, but the Cyber Key has been changed to a standard
Cybertron Autobot Cyber Key... with a pink border, of course.

     Elita-1 is my least
favorite of the Botcon 2009 exclusives. The mold was pretty weak to begin
with, but then to make it pink, pink, black and blue, and then more pink
just wasn't a good aesthetic decision, in my opinion. Still, some people
do like the girly bots, and if that's the case with you... well, actually
I still can't recommend her even then, given the mold. But hey, at least
you've managed to read through this entire review without being blinded,
so that's a good sign.

       Elita-1's origins are a mystery to everyone
but Grimlock. In fact, no one in the Autobot ranks even knew she existed
until Grimlock first brought his newly formed crew aboard the Graviton.
There she was, quietly working behind one of the ship's consoles, paying
no attention to the inquisitive looks directed her way. Every member of
the crew has a theory about her, but she isn't talking, and neither is
Grimlock. A skilled fighter, Elita-1 is adept with the Circuit-Su form
of combat. Her weapon of choice is a hyper-concussive missile launcher
that converts into an EMP scrambler. Mimetic alloy armor allows her to
blend into her surroundings and can also refract laser weapons fire into
blinding bursts of light. While confident in her abilities, she feels that
she has yet to fully prove herself to others, leading her to take unnecessary
risks.
