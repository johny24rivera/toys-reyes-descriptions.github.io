    Being that Prowl is another
6" Titanium toy to be inspired by the pre-G1 "War Within" comic book series,
his alternate mode is a vehicle, but not a recognizably Earthen one. It's
got some features of a police car, like the general coloration and the
white and blue "lights", but other than that it looks like some kind of
futuristic hovercraft. This is one of the best War Within alternate modes,
in that it actually LOOKS plausible, rather than just being the robot mode
lain over or with proportions that are totally out of whack. My only real
beef with the vehicle mode's proportions has to do with the main body--
it's segmented into three parts, the two side "fins" and the center section.
Personally-- even though it means you don't transform the chest at all
for robot mode-- I like to keep all three of those sections slid together,
it makes for a more solid-looking vehicle mode. Another, smaller, problem
I have with this mode is that the fists stick out a little bit-- but just
a little bit, so it's easily overlooked. The way the "siren lights" are
situated all over Prowl's body-- with all the lights on the right side
being blue and all the lights on the left side being red-- helps to give
him more of an "emergency" feel, and the black, white, and gray coloring,
while not the most original in the world, definitely screams "Prowl" and
is a generally nice color scheme. Prowl's also got tons of mold and paint
detailing, which leads to a few cool features, such as the painted design
details underneath the transparent blue plastic of his "cockpit" and a
star Autobot emblem near the front of the vehicle mode. There's also turbines
molded and painted on the rear end of this mode to give him a "propulsion
system", and the rear-mounted wings are a nice homage to his shoulder-mounted
missiles on his

     original G1 form
    </a>
    , while still
serving as a functional part of the alternate mode.

    In contrast to most
6" Titanium toys, Prowl's robot mode is where most of his problems actually
lie. He's got some major proportional problems wrong with his upper body--
his head is ludicrously small compared to his impossibly wide shoulders
and fairly deep chest, to the point of looking almost laughable. His arms
are also a bit short and stubby proportionally, and his fists aren't obvious
enough on his lower arms (though the upside of this has already been explained
in vehicle mode). There's also a very noticable gap in front of Prowl's
head, where you can see down into his chest. On the plus side, the legs
are pretty nice-looking proportionally, so no problems there. The rear
missile launchers also tuck behind his shoulders in a very G1-ish style,
though I wish they weren't situated quite so high above said shoulders.
Prowl also has fairly good articulation-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two points), waist, hips (at three points),
and knees. His missile launchers can also rotate up and down. One of his
shoulder joints on each arm is rather loose, however, and his chest is
so wide and his arms so short it limits his posability more there than
it otherwise would have. Prowl's diecast parts are his lower legs and the
middle section of his chest.

    War Within Prowl has
some MAJOR proportion problems when it comes to his upper body in robot
mode, but if you can overlook that (and the $5 U.S. increase in price due
to the exclusive nature of the toy), then you may want to look into getting
him if you like the character. His vehicle mode is particularly original
and intriguing. He's not the worst of the 6" Titaniums, but he's not the
best, either.

      The most single-minded of all the Autobots,
Prowl is sometimes referred to as the commanders Sharkticon because
of the way he seizes a problem and refuses to let it go until it is solved.
He rivals even Shockwave in the fields of cryptology, logistics and strategic
planning. In fact, the two of them will occasionally engage in complex
shadow wars that rage beneath the surface of an ongoing battle, logical
games designed more to frustrate and confound each other than secure victory
for their sides.

      Prowl believes that there is a reason
for all things. He struggles to understand the perspective even of his
enemies, believing that if he can discern the logical underpinnings of
the Decepticon cause, he can devise a strategy for final victory. Though
he is often torn by emotions in conflict with his logic, he has difficulty
understanding how others can be so ruled by feeling and instinct. He believes
that all creatures behave according to some complex arithmetic, and that
if he could only work it out, he could bring peace to the universe.
