       This "redeco" of Jetfire
keeps the same colors of black and red that make him look like a SR-71
Blackbird, though the black is a smidge lighter on this one-- almost a
very dark gray, in fact. The red lines and paint apps on his jet mode are
the same as well, though there's some more silver paint apps on his robot
mode, particularly on the upper legs, which have some nice "metallic worn/fade"
spray apps. Jetfire's Autobot symbol is also displayed quite proudly on
his hunchback on this version, instead of having a worn down Decepticon
symbol in its place like on the original version. The most obvious change
this time around is the changing of the light gray plastic to a rather
bright shade of electric blue, similar to the "Allspark Power" plastic
used in the latter half of the first movie line. It makes a mild bit of
sense if you consider Jetfire to be "powered up" if you link this version
with the included Optimus figure, but by itself it just doesn't look right.
Oh, electric blue contrasts decently enough with black-- almost any color
does-- but with the rest of Jetfire looking so realistically detailed,
it looks really out-of-place to have one of his main colors look like it
came straight from the Generation 2 toyline.

          Hasbro definitely doesn't
try to re-write the book with this redeco; Megatron is largely the same
color (gray) as his initial RotF release, but most of the plastic used
for his main body of the tank mode (or legs of the robot mode, take your
pick) is a bit more brownish of a shade, likely to give Megatron a dusty,
"desert-worn" look, given the bio of this set. He still has some of his
regular ol' light gray on his turret-arms, though. There's a very nice
black paint wash on most of his pieces-- pretty much on everything except
his turret-arms, actually-- which helps to bring out the "worn" effect
even better. However, the aforementioned paint wash is really the only
paint app on this toy (beyond the eyes), and without a real eye-catching
color to contrast against all the dull brown and gray, this redeco of Megatron
comes out looking pretty boring. Even moreso than his initial gray-and-black
release, and that's honestly a bit tough to do.

             This repaint of Optimus
hearkens more back to his "classic" G1 color scheme, with a somewhat light
shade of red taking over much of the area that was gray on the other releases
of this toy. Combined with the dark blue middle section for contrast, it
may be a basic color scheme, but it still works on ol' Prime here. There's
also quite a bit of nice silver paint on him, like on the smokestacks,
grill, robot face, and windows-- places that were mostly left as barren
gray plastic on this toy's previous color schemes. He still has a bit of
Movie-style paint apps on him, though-- namely, the metallic dark blue
flames near the front, which help to add a bit more color variety to his
vehicle mode. (That said, I do wish a few more silver paint apps had been
added to the sides of said mode, as there's just a TAD too much red.) Overall
though, this is definitely my favorite of this mold's various paint jobs--
not so much because "it's G1", mind you, but the way the silver, dark blue,
and red play off each other-- as well as the AMOUNTS of each of them, roughly--
is the most visually pleasing.

                I really wish they'd
stop repainting this awful mold and packing it in with other things I'm
interested in. That said, there ARE some pretty slick color picks this
time for it. After constantly getting blah brown and/or gray plastic on
this mold, this time around most of it (particularly the jet parts) are
painted a nice metallic silver, which looks pretty slick-- particularly
as it contrasts with the black Cybertronian "tattoos" on Starscream's wings.
The rest of Starscream's plastic is gray, but it's a glittery color of
gray, and so looks semi-metallic under the right light. It's not exactly
an exciting shade of the color, but it's considerably better-looking than
the milky light gray that's been on most versions of this mold up to this
point. The couple of accent paint apps-- such as the golden yellow cockpit
and the light red on the robot eyes-- also look good, though they're not
prominent enough to stop the color scheme from still mostly being different
shades of the same monochromatic scheme, metallic silver added or not.

used for the Voyager class toy. The black and light fiery orange contrast
remarkably well, and The Fallen has enough paint apps on him where one
color isn't overly predominant on any part of the toy. That said, there
are only two colors on this toy, period (well, unless you count the allegiance
symbol). Using a few accent colors for some places like the face, eyes,
and/or the jet mode nosecone would've helped turn this basic color scheme
from simply an improvement over the original's to something that really
popped.

                     "The Victory of the Fallen"
set is probably a set best recommended for those people who A. like these
little miniature TFs (or simply don't have the cash on hand to get the
bigger versions of the characters) and B. have few, if any, of the molds
in this set. Although the molds in this pack range from pretty nice to
downright awful, no new characters are introduced in this 5-pack, nor are
any of the color schemes completely unlike any other versions of these
characters, to boot. That said, most of the color schemes on the toys in
this set are either better than any of their previous version's colors
or at least on par with them, so pallete-wise (and value-wise) it's a fairly
wise choice for those who want small versions of these major RotF characters.
But if you don't fit both of the criteria mentioned above, then this set
is a very easy pass.
