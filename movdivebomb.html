    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Thundercracker

     Divebomb's overall color
scheme is based off of a particular kind of Russian jet-- hence the otherwise-odd
yellow coloration with jagged brown stripes all over his vehicle mode.
At first I thought Divebomb's color scheme was overly loud (and still do),
but the fact that it's realistic justifies the color scheme a bit more
in a line that aims at least a fair amount of realism. Overall though,
I am really not a fan of Divebomb's color scheme. The brown is a fair contrast
color against the yellow in vehicle mode, but it's practically nowhere
in robot mode, and the light gray is really not a good contrasting color
against the yellow at all. The dark gray does a fairly good job of it,
but that shade's not used nearly enough on the toy to really help much.
in that respect. Overall, Divebomb's just way too... bright. I do have
to say that I like the transparent bluish green plastic used for his cockpit
and optics, though-- it gives him a bit more individuality, and given his
rather "toxic" existence mentioned in his bio, is kinda cool. Plus, it
contrasts well with the yellow in the few places it's used.

     No mold changes have
been made to Divebomb-- in fact, this mold is starting to degrade a little.
The parts are even more loose than they were on the previous uses of this
mold. Divebomb comes with a transparent purple Decepticon Cyber Key.

     Divebomb is a fairly
loud, somewhat ugly repaint of one of the worst molds from the Cybertron
line, though his deco in vehicle mode is at least somewhat interesting.
Still, not really much here to recommend unless you're a completist.

       Divebomb tries his hardest to make friends
with the other Decepticons, but they go out of their way to avoid him.
Everyone recognizes his skill an aerial fighter, his intelligence as a
tactician, and his positive attitude towards the goal of total Decepticon
domination. Unfortunately, his reactor containment is so bad that other
robots can't stand to be near him. Wherever he goes, he leaves a trail
of toxic fumes, and he emits so much radiation that it short-circuits the
sensor systems of those nearby.
