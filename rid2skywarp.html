    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior version
of Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RID2015

     Welp, I'm pretty sure
you guys are familiar with Skywarp. Redeco of Starscream in black, purple,
and silver? Yep, they did it again for RID2015, and by and large they haven't
really changed much from the usual Skywarp redeco. He's mostly black, with
a dark purple plastic used on the feet, lower arms, and guns. The purple
plastic is a rather nice, semi-metallic shade with a good amount of glitter
mixed in, so it looks rather eye-catching. Surprisingly, most of the purple
on Skywarp is actually paint-- a really nice metallic shade is used on
the main wings and shoulders. Surprisingly, a different, duller shade of
purple is used on the kneecaps, tailfins, and a stripe down the center
of his forehead. Not really sure why they didn't just use the metallic
shade instead there-- it's a great shade. Anyways, although Skywarp has
SOME silver on small stripes on his wings and on his face, his pecs and
chest are actually a blah light milky gray plastic shade, which doesn't
look NEARLY as good. Still, at least it's not used much, but man, he really
could've used some more of that nice silver coloration to help spice up
all that black a bit more. There's some pale light yellow used for his
cockpit window in vehicle mode and the window on his chest, and given how
light it is, it contrasts exceedingly well with the black. Finaly, there's
just a titch of some fairly dark red paint, used for Skywarp's eyes.

     RID2015 Skywarp is a
largely by-the-numbers redeco of a Starscream toy, with the only surprises
being some slight negatives, such as having a bit too much black plastic,
and using milky gray plastic on his body instead of silver paint. He still
looks better than Starscream color-wise, but I think Hasbro made a few
minor bad calls that kept his color scheme from really shining.
