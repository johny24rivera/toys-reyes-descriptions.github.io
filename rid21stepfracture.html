    Fracture's stylized motorcycle
mode is mostly done fairly well for a 1-step changer. The "body" of the
motorcycle is definitely a bit more bulky and square-ish than it should
be, but all of his parts are actually compressed enough in there where
it doesn't bother me that much. I'd consider it a minor downside as opposed
to a mode-ruining downside, let's just say that. The windshield, handlebars,
and the front wheel are definitely the best part of this mode, and have
very good mold detailing, from the round windshield, long bar down the
center that leads to the front wheel, and a good number of little "divots"
and the like, which goes a bit against the RID2015 usual of having rather
sparse detailing. Regarding the body, because it's "stretched" a little
for the transformation, the mold detailing isn't quite as impressive, but
it's still decent-- there's the usual RID divot-lines near the back end,
a nifty "ninja star-like" detail on the sides, quite a lot of spikes near
the back, and overly wide exhaust pipes detailed near the bottom rear (that
REALLY should have had some silver paint detailing). On the back end you
can see the top of the robot head, as well as a bit of the spikes of the
robot shoulders, so it's the weakest area of this mode, but it's not like
you look at this mode often from that angle, so again, minor downside.
The color scheme is two different shades of purple for the most part, which
contrast and complement each other quite well. The purple plastic colors
are nice as well, as they're a semi-metallic shade, with glitter interspersed
throughout. There's also some nice red stripes on the windshield and on
the front wheel hub, as well as some silver on the "ninja star" details
on the sides. Beyond black wheels, there's also a little black on the center
of the windshield as well.

    To transform Fracture
to robot mode, just rotate the front wheel section back, which acts as
a lever to open up the rest of the motorcycle body to reveal the entirety
of the robot mode. In robot mode Fracture looks pretty darned good too,
with the only extra being the motorcycle wheel behind his upper back--
which isn't show accurate, but it is there as part of the transformation
and only sticks out a little, so I really don't mind it. As far as the
core robot mode itself, the proportions are largely good, as are the details--
honestly if this thing had better articulation and less 2-D lower arms
that are merely molded onto flat flaps of the motorcycle mode, I'd think
this was a slightly small Warrior class toy. All of the major details are
here, and not stretched out or warped much-- the spiked shoulders, the
claws on the hands, the faux motorcycle windshield on the chest, the fairly
lithe proportions-- it's generallly quite good. I will say I wish the upper
legs were a bit larger, though. The headsculpt is VERY well-done, complete
with a gray mohawk and silver on the face with red eyes. He's got a rather
stern look on his face, which fits Fracture. The light milky gray plastic
used for his mohawk and upper legs is fortunately not that bland but ALSO
has glitter in it like the rest of his plastic, so it looks semi-metallic.
As far as paint apps, beyond the face there's some red bits on the shoulders
and lower legs, as well as some black and silver on the faux windshield-chest.
It's spread pretty evenly over the body, and thus his colors are broken
up a bit more in this mode. I do wish his claws or lower arms had a bit
of paint, but otherwise he looks pretty good in that respect. As far as
articulation, Fracture can move back-and-forth at the elbows, but that's
it-- though again, articulation isn't much of a concern for 1-step changers.

    Fracture is a solid
1-step changer; his motorcycle mode body is a little bit boxy, and yes
he has limited articulation like basically every 1-step changer, but otherwise
he looks pretty nice in BOTH modes, a rarity among toys with this gimmick.
Good plastic colors, a decent amount of paint, nice proportions, few extras
in both modes; this is an easy recommendation for those who want a toy
of Fracture that is really easy to transform; in fact I think he's one
of the best 1-step changers in the entire line.
