    Rodimus' Classics toy
is very similar in its vehicle mode when compared to the
    <a href="rodimusmajor.html">
     G1
version
    </a>
    . There's more paint detailing, of course, and the proportions
have been "sleeked out" a bit more. Because of those small proportion changes,
even though it still doesn't look like a real car, it looks CLOSER to one.
The "racing fin" on the back is also orange now instead of yellow, and
a bit larger and more detailed as well, so it looks much better. The exhaust
pipes on the sides don't stick out anymore, and are more realistic in their
proportions while still giving the impression that this is a racin' machine.
The metallic gold flames look much cooler and more stylized on Rodimus
now, and aren't just a sticker anymore. The silvery blue bumper looks somewhat
out of place given that there's no further detailing on those parts, though
it was fairly cool how there's "headlight tops" molded on the sides of
the front of this mode, though they don't actually slide up to reveal actual
headlights. And, although you can see the driver's seats and whatnot through
the windows, I don't like the color of said windows-- purple just doesn't
go well with this otherwise fiery color scheme, and it's the only bad color
choice of the bunch, really. Using it for the exhaust flames also looks
rather odd too, though I have to admit the placement of the gun in the
back part of this mode with the exhaust flames being the projectile fired
from said gun was pretty ingenious. Rodimus' Autobot rub symbol is smack
dab on the top of this mode, in between the windows.

    Rodimus' robot mode
is also pretty similar to his G1 toy, but with, again, more realistic proportions
and more detailing. In fact, you can tell that, despite the different transformation,
the designers went to lengths to make sure that he still DID look like
Rodimus, such as the upper arm design, the leg detailing, and even the
exhaust pipe-guns on the back of his hands. I like the "door skirt' added
to his upper legs, even if they do hamper the movement of the upper legs
slightly. The engine/flame chest looks very nice, as does the detailing
on his head. The head is just a tad small, however, and Rodimus' expression
is a bit to serious considering his character. He does have light piping
in his eyes, but his backpack (which has the characteristic Rodimus fins
over the shoulders, of course) prevents light from shining through them,
not to mention the rather dark shade of purple used. One of the most ingenious
parts of this toy has to with Rodimus' legs-- it's hard to explain to someone
who doesn't have the toy, but there's several little engineering touches
that, though not needed, really help the toy feel more solid down there.
There's the fact that the wheels actually scootch out some so that they
don't interfere with the upper leg panels, tha the flip-down leg panels
really weren't needed other than that they actually help to cover up robot
parts on the BOTTOM of the vehicle mode and make it feel slightly more
solid, and the way the robot feet fold around and out without being too
obvious in vehicle mode is really neat. I'm not too fond of Rodimus' arms,
however, for the sole reason that when the bend at the elbows, there's
no real "mass" underneath to make it look like he's bending his elbows,
more like he's cracking his arms in half. He does have a neat little flip-out
chainsaw blade under his left arm, though (the box mistakenly refers to
it as a voice communicator), which is really cool considering his used
them in the original Transformers Animated Movie. Rodimus' articulation
is decent, but not up to par with most of the other Classics-- he can move
at the head, back-and-forth and the shoulders and elbows, at his hips (at
two places, though the door skirt does restrict some movement), and two
places at his knees.

    Classics Rodimus is
a very nice update to his G1 self, with a very sleek vehicle mode and several
very nice enginerring touches in robot mode. His arms don't look the best,
though, and he is fairly limited in articulation, however, along with a
few other minor proportional problems. Recommended.

      Young and bold, Rodimus races headlong
into danger, throwing caution - and his orders - to the wind. He dreams
of heroic deeds and hopes one day to gain the recognition his actions deserve.
Despite his inexperience, he is a talented fighter. In battle, he can often
be seen racing at speeds up to 180 miles per hour, dodging explosions and
laser blasts in an attempt to close on his objective.
