    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Iron Man. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     This redeco of Iron Man
is definitely in colors identical to the character War Machine in the Marvel
comics, but for some reason the packaging still refers to him as Iron Man.
Anyways, War Machine's color scheme has always looked pretty boss, and
his Marvel TF is no exception that rule. Black makes a nice main color
for a mech-- not to mention a jet, to make it more "stealthy"-- and the
gray serves as a nice secondary color, though I really would've preferred
a more silvery color instead. As it is, it's that same swirly impure gray
that's used on so many Transformers these days for some reason. The transparent
red cockpit is also a nice touch, and the silver used in spots on the robot
mode is, as expected, like the milky gray but better-looking. The use of
a dull yellow for the mech mode optics also looks really cool as well,
and helps differentiate him from the typical "red optics=evil" thing that
so many black robots have. I REALLY like the metallic brownish gray that's
used for the lining of the cockpit and nowhere else on the figure-- it
gives a "rusty, worn" look to the figure, and I wish it had been used more
liberally in the vehicle mode, particularly on the mian body where it's
just a big patch of milky gray plastic, which looks rather boring. War
Machine's missiles are a light red, which look out-of-place compared to
such a dark color scheme and--dare I say it--"Playskoolish".

     No mold changes have
been made to the Iron Man "War Machine" redeco.

     The Iron Man "War Machine"
is a great repaint of a great mold. The light red missiles look out of
place, and I wish there were a few more paint apps on the main body of
the vehicle mode to break up all that gray, but those are both minor quibbles.
Easily recommended over the original release.

       It takes brains as well as brawn to
engage an enemy like Doctor Doom. That's why Iron Man's mech hides its
true nature in flight, making him look like a normal fighter jet. He lulls
his enemies into a false sense of security, then converts into the most
powerful Iron Man yet to take them down.
