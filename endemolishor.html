    Demolishor's vehicle
mode has undergone a major change- instead of a futuristic missile tank,
he's now... a dump truck. Some upgrade, eh? Anyways, that's actually one
of my complaints about this toy, although it has to do more with the toy's
name than the toy itself (so I'm not taking off any points for this one)-
this just doesn't look like an upgrade of Demolishor at all. Other than
being a Decepticon packing a lot of firepower, there's absolutely no relation
between Energon Demolishor and
    <a href="demolishor.html">
     Armada Demolishor
    </a>
    .
As for the vehicle mode itself, it probably looked very good on paper.
But it doesn't translate that well into real life. From a front view, or
even a diagonal view as pictured above, Demolishor looks great. But look
at him from more of a side view and the believability of this mode just
falls apart. There's just this HUGE gap in the middle of his side in vehicle
mode, and his robot legs are just so incredibly obvious on the bottom half.
The feet also kinda stick out behind the truck- maybe molding the front
of the feet so that they looked like exhaust pipes in this mode would have
made them a bit less obvious. The wheels connected to the feet also don't
line up quite right, making Demolishor look like he's got a bit of a flat
on his back tires from the way this mode is tilted slightly. Another, more
minor, quibble- WHY does Demolishor have this HUGE Decepticon symbol on
his dump truck bed!? It's so big it looks ridiculous. Not to mention he
doesn't need it at all, seeing as how he already has two Decepticon symbols
on the front of this mode. I guess he makes good Autobot target practice.
Demolishor has an excellent color scheme, though. It hearkens back to the
G1 Constructicons, what with the green and purple, but it throws a few
more colors into the mix, such as silver and brown, that really complement
everything wonderfully. I literally wouldn't change a thing about Demolishor's
paint job and scheme (minus taking away the big honkin' Decepticon symbol).
You can also move around his truck bed, whether you want to either "dump
his cargo" or fire some of his missiles. Speaking of missiles, Demolishor
has FOUR individually triggered missiles- a number that, I believe, is
unprecedented in a Transformer of this size. (He does look like he has
eight, but half of those are just fake details. It seems that it's Demolishor's
curse to never be able to fire more than half his missiles. I can understand
why they did this, though- having a whopping eight firing missiles would've
been expensive.)

    Demolishor's robot mode
is VERY cool. He still has that great color scheme, only now that delicious
metallic purple makes it even better. I also like the metallic blue-silver
"belt buckle" detailing near his waist, and the "worn metal" paint decoes
on his feet and his waist-bumper (which is also where his Decepticon spark
crystal is, in case you're wondering). The criss-cross "stitching" that
goes along his chest is also interesting. The best part about this mode,
though, is the robot head- it's one of the neatest-looking Energon Decepticon
faces, and that's saying a lot. The purple fin and circular "ears" really
look great, as does the large chin and slitted eyes. It looks very Vehicon-ish,
which to me is definitely a good thing. Yes, Demolishor's main body is
a bit wide, but it works for a stocky guy like him. The large missile pack
on his back also complements the mode rather than just detracting from
it- it shows that he's got a load of firepower and he's not afraid to use
it. In addition, Demolishor's got great articulation- he can move at he
head, the shoulders (at two points), the elbows, the waist, the hips (at
two points), and the knees (at two points). So you can get him into a good
deal of poses, even if he does tend to be a bit back-heavy with that missile
pack. The only thing I'm not very fond of in this mode are his arms- they're
transparent, which I don't like on main body parts because it looks weird,
but they're also too small when compared with the rest of his body. A bulky
guy like Demolishor needs beefier arms.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Demolishor's "hyper
mode" is admittedly pretty stupid. You basically just rotate his head down
and his missile pack up so that he can fire it straight. His head looks
absolutely ridiculous just jutting from his guy like that, though, and
this also brings into view all the unsightly square plastic pieces that
connect the missile pack to his main body.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Demolishor's vehicle
mode is not very solid at all, and his hyper mode is weak at best, but
his robot mode is GREAT, and his color scheme can't be beat. He's also
got an unprecedented number of firing missiles on a deluxe-sized toy. When
stacked up against the other Decepticons, he tends to be with the weaker
ones, but that's not saying much, since they're nearly all great. Mildly
recommended.

      Demolishor is a nasty Decepticon with
an equally nasty weapons arsenal. To challenge him would be futile. He
loves the thrill of the fight but he especially enjoys inflicting pain
on his enemies. In vehicle mode, he is a burly dump truck that is stacked
with powerful Energon launchers capable of taking down any Autobot that
stands in his way. Though a bit uncontrollable at times, Megatron prides
Demolishor as one of the Decepticons greatest warriors.
