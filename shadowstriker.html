    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RiD Side Burn. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of RiD Side Burn
    <a href="sideburn.html">
     here

    .)
   </font>
   <p>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Shadow Striker is a partial
remold of RiD Side Burn, but it's a significant remold- this mold is now
female, thanks to the face being completely changed! The thing is, this
toy "sex change" actually works, to a certain extent. It isn't a stretch
to attribute Side Burn's physique to a female's. I don't like the actual
face itself, though- although the Romanesque "helmet" loks nice, the lips
are too big and puffy, and a bit corny, if I do say so myself. Plus, she's
got a Decepticon symbol on her hood, but an easy-to-make-out Autobot symbol
on her left arm. Rather major oversight, if you ask me.

     As for the color scheme,
it's good. But not
     <i>
      as
     </i>
     good as the rest of the Side Burn paint jobs.
The black and teal go together especially well, but black only works well
when the mode isn't COVERED with it, and there's not enough contrast in
the vehicle mode. The tannish orangish brown I could also live without,
as it doesn't really fit 100% with the other colors. It's still a good
color scheme, don't get me wrong- the others are just better, as the Side
Burn mold has always had nice colors. I do prefer the "flame" deco that
Side Burn had in vehicle mode as opposed to the two plain stripes as well.
And Shadow Striker does indeed have the Dodge symbol on the front of her
vehicle mode.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Shadow Striker is a
nice repaint, but I can't recommend it over the others, especially since
she comes with Roulette, who has such a superior paint job. Plus, I don't
like the female face with the big lips. Pick it up if you like exclusive
merchandise or the Side Burn mold, but otherwise pass. Especially since
it's still so dang hard to transform...

       Forced to watch her sister's death at
the hands of nomadic invaders, Shadow Striker learned at a very early age
the difference between those who held the power and those who were the
power. She ran constant jobs for the criminal underworld and was particularly
favored by one of the more feared gangsters who dabbled in Spark extraction
technologies. The memory of her stolen childhood constantly haunts Shadow
Striker as she struggles to come to terms with her past, present, and future.
Has a specially outfitted engine that provides a sonic dampening cone,
enabling her to employ a temporary stealth mode. In robot form, wields
a titanium-reinforced shield and an acid heat blaster.
