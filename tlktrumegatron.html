    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations IDW "Stealth
Bomber" Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of "Stealth
Bomber" Megatron

     The deluxe version of
TLK Megatron takes a bit of a different approach. Most of the other redecoes
of toys for movie lines that are exclusives are either original characters
or just kinda "cheat" a bit and reference previous versions of the relevant
character and pretend that design is still current. For this toy, Hasbro
instead took the IDW "Stealth Bomber" Megatron-- a more G1-ish design,
albeit certainly modernized a bit-- and used the TLK Megatron color scheme
on it. He's mostly a dark gray, as you'd would expect, with a fair amount
of dull gold. Only a little bit of the gold-- some paint, really-- is visible
in vehicle mode, with some ridges in the middle-rear section of each wing,
on the nose, and on the vents near the front. There's also "MEGATRON" in
Cybertronian in gold on the wings, which fits the Toys "R" Us exclusive
"gimmick" for its TLK products. I do like the bit of added gold, but between
that and a very limited amount of royal purple on the windows, he looks
a bit boring in vehicle mode. Also, I'm no sure what's up with the wings
being a very obviously different shade of dark gray (MUCH paler) than the
plastic on the rest of the figure-- it's a real mismatch and looks odd
here. In robot mode, though, Hasbro gets MUCH more generous with the other
colors beyond gray, considerably moreso than on any other TLK figure of
him. He's got quite a lot of dull goldish brown plastic on his upper arms
and legs, interspersed with more of the dark milky gray plastic and some
dull gold paint here and there. A bit of purple is also added to the mix,
a color that's totally absent from most other TLK Megatron toys-- it's
on the fists, waist, and on the chest windows and robot face. This really
pops against the gold in particular, and makes me wish it was used on the
actual TLK model more. There's also some nice transparent orange plastic
used for the wings/robot cannon, which goes great with just about any color,
the ones on this toy included.

     There is one mold change
for this figure, and it's the head. Instead of the regular IDW Megatron
head, this one's been retooled into a sort of "G1-ized" version of TLK
Megatron's head. He still has the really cool, sloped helmet with some
small humps on the top and curved horns at the sides of the mouth, but
the face inside looks more distinctly human, with 2 red eyes, a normal
nose, and a normal, thin, not-toothy mouth. The face is also painted a
very pale shade of purple; it looks quite good.

     The deluxe TRU exclusive
version of TLK Megatron is one of the few movie figures I'd recommend to
someone who isn't a fan of the movie aesthetic. This toy does an excellent
job of taking the general color scheme and "feel" of TLK Megatron, but
giving him a more classic, G1-ish aesthetic, even carrying over to the
new headsculpt. Adding in a bit of purple also helps make the scheme more
classically Decepticon, and the stealth bomber mode-- though a bit dull
color-wise-- is a nice alternative for those who don't like alien alternate
modes. If you fit into this category, I'd recommend this toy; otherwise,
get one of the new-mold, accurate TLK Megatron toys intead.
