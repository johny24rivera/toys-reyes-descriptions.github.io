    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is fairly good for a Happy Meal toy, with the proportions being pretty
darn good overall. Heck, in some respects he actually looks LESS chubby/kiddy
than the mainline toy, such as in the slightly lengthier proportions here.
All of the required mold detailing is here, though the paint detailing
is merely adequate-- at least the windows and Bumblebee's characteristic
stripe is painted (though all black-- the stripe almost blends win with
the window), but the headlights and siren, both rather major details on
Animated Bumblebee, are left unpainted here. So he's pretty much just all
black and yellow with no real accents in this mode, which makes him look
pretty bland. It's also worth nothing that Bumblebee's wheels are merely
molded in-- there's tinier wheels under them that actually move the toy
along. Bumblebee has one extra in this mode, and that's that his robot
head prety blatantly sticks out the back end, just staring out into space.
I wish his neck could have at least turned around so you've have the back
of his head facing outwards. On a more minor note, there's a gap in the
front bumper due to his transformation.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
certainly isn't as good as his vehicle mode, though compared to some other
McDonald's Animated Happy Meal toys it's not the worst. His head is teeny
tiny proprtionally, as are his arms, which are merely molded on the side
of his car doors. Granted, this is how it is on the show model as well,
but the arms are really 2-D here and aren't as obviously arms, looking
more like just long car panels instead. His chest is a bit boxy, but that's
a minor complaint at this scale-- I really don't like how he only has one
uni-leg, though, as it would've been pretty easy to seperate them-- practically
just a slide down the middle of the piece, and you would've gotten individual
knee articluation due to the transformation. Instead, you can't rotate
his legs back at the knee without making it impossible for him to stand
up. The windshield-feet look good, though. As for the rest of his articulation,
he can move at the shoulders, the waist, and his head can look up a bit
due to the transformation.

    Happy Meal Animated
Bumblebee is one of the better toys from this promotion, though honestly
that's not saying much. His robot mode, though it has some positives like
the chest and general leg shape, is still pretty awkward with a tiny head
and arms. His vehicle mode is pretty decent given that he's a Happy Meal
toy, though.
