    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars "G1-eque"
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of CW "G1-esque"

     Well, here's an homage
I wasn't expecting-- yessir, the Armada version of Megatron has actually
been remolded from a design also used for a G1-esque toy of Megatron! There
are several things for this mold that call back to the
     <a href="armegatron.html">
      Armada
version
     </a>
     more than the G1-esque version, actually, with the tank mode
in particular looking pretty nice, keeping many of the details that Armada
Megatron had while getting rid of the impractical futuristic "H-tank" look
and making it a much more realistic-looking tank, as well. (That said,
a detail looking like the horns of Megatron's head poking down the center
middle of the vehicle is highlighted in paint-- a nice touch that calls
back to the original toy.) The Minicon ports on the mold were also certainly
put on this toy for this version, even though none of the Minicon ports
actually activate anything. The military green of Armada Megatron fits
the tank mode quite nicely, and there's tons of paint apps and an impressive
number of colors used on the mold this time around. The metallic silver
blue on the armor panels on the sides and top of the tank mode and a similiar
color of that shade in plastic being used for the cannon complements the
green very well, making Armada Megatron very visually interesting despite
not being "dipped in paint" like the G1-esque version of this mold. There's
also just a titch of purple and light red-orange accents peeking through
in vehicle mode to give it some more interesting coloration, but the robot
mode is where the purple and red-orange really shine through, particularly
on the upper legs and some small connector bits. In robot mode his color
scheme is thus considerably more varied, with the purple and a fair amount
of silver on the chest, arms, and lower legs adding more to all that green.
The transformation is technically the same for this toy as for the G1-esque
Megatron, but I like to keep this version's treads folded out a bit behind
the arms to give him more of an Armada Megatron silouhette. All of this
said, however, the robot mode is where this toy suffers, and considerably
moreso than on G1-esque Megatron. Having the cannon on the right arm, the
shape of the lower legs, the chest-- they're all VERY G1 Megatron, and
don't really fit Armada Megatron at all, and these are all big negatives.
Some of these should have been vastly remolded or the transformation redesigned
a bit to help differentiate him and de-emphasize these similarities.

     Armada Megatron has
a new head mold, which sculpt-wise looks nice in the face (particularly
with the nice cherry red light piping for the eyes and the light metallic
purple on the face), but the horns are way too small proportionally, and
look off without being large clamps like on the original Armada toy. That's
it as far as mold changes-- all the more unfortunate for this toy.

Megatron has an impressive number of different colors and paint apps on
him, and his tank mode looks awesome-- but his robot mode isn't remolded
nearly enough to differentiate him from the iconic G1 Megatron design,
and the one part that is remolded (the head) is too mal-proportioned to
look all that intimidating. Unless articulation matters more to you than
anything else, I'd just get the original toy instead-- the original may
not be as much of a marvel of engineering, but it's a lot more fun and
looks a lot more intimidating.
