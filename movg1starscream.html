    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Voyager Starscream toy

     As seems to be happening
with all of the movie toys that had a G1 version of the same character,
Starscream gets his movie toy repainted in heavily

     color scheme. The gray, dark blue, and light red do go quite well together,
and I also rather like the Decepticon emblem designs on the wings-- but
they do sort of ruin the whole "realistic" look of the movie line. As such,
it doesn't get quite the high marks it otherwise would with the same color
scheme. Pains were taken to ensure that the color scheme was G1-accurate,
though, with red stripes in the appropriate places on the wings and the
blue parts roughly corresponding to where they were on the G1 toy. Not
to mention that Starscream here has a new, remolded noggin that is sort
of an amalgamation of his G1 head and his movie head. Basically, it's very
monster-ish from the optics and below, but the forehead is a near-replica
of the "head vents" that the original G1 toy had. It does look like the
mish-mash of head parts that it is, however-- the head vents just don't
fit in at all with the overall monsterish look of the face, and I personally
think the normal Movie Starscream head looks much better on this mold.

     G1-Redeco Movie Starscream
is an interesting repaint, and solely as a toy I think the colors look
better than the rather dull tan on the original Movie Starscream, though
the colors admittedly don't fit in with the "realistic jet" feel that the
original Movie Starscream had. Plus, the head remold just doesn't look
right on this toy, in my opinion, which is the only reason why this version
of Voyager Starscream gets an ever-so-slightly-lower score than the original
toy did.

       Sole survivor of the catastrophic battle
that destroyed the other Decepticons, Starscream fled into the vast and
cloudy skies of Earth, away from the searching eyes of the Autobots. His
alien skin totally transparent to the primitive sensing technologies of
humanity's armies, it was easy for him to find a place to hide. Altering
his exterior was a simple matter, and made it even easier to hide from
his enemies. With Megatron gone, and the AllSpark lost, he waits, and plots,
and plans for a future in which he rises at the head of a mighty Decepticon
army to reclaim all that his former leader lost.
