    Optimus' Beast
Hunters upgrade-- unlike most Autobots' and Decepticons' in the line--
is a brand new mold. He's a big honkin' heavy-duty truck just brimming
with weapons and edges, and thus isn't much of a "robot in disguise" in
this mode-- but honestly, when you're this loaded out, who needs disguise?
Optimus' truck proportions are-- more or less-- a box on wheels in this
mode, with no real steamlined look to it much at all. He looks pretty good
from the front, with an awesome "spike bumper" and some hard angles to
his design-- and I love the angular design of his folded up wings on the
back two-thirds of this mode, as well. However, there are some fairly obvious
robot mode extras in this mode. For one, Prime doesn't have a real back
end-- it's just the bottom of his robot feet. No rear bumper in sight.
His robot fists also poke out the back end. On the top, slightly behind
the front, you can also quite obviously see the back of his head (which
doesn't fold all the way in), and his shoulders are a bit obvious behind
that section as well. On the sides, in the gap between the front wheels
and the back wheels, his upper legs poke out a little too. Still, most
of the REALLY blatant stuff is covered up by his folded wings, so despite
all his faults here, he has the least obvious robot extras out of all the
molds made for this design. There's plenty of mold detailing on him, but
in that stylized Prime way, where there's areas of relatively little mold
detailing (like the top front) and areas of what looks like curved metal
bits on his gray parts next to occasional areas of quite intricate mold
detailing, like his heavy-duty wheels (which are clip-on, but this is barely
noticeable) and all the armor panels and little headlights on his front
side. His color scheme is more or less classic Optimus Prime, with red,
dark blue, and light gray being his primary colors. Unfortunately, his
light gray is of the awful, boring "light milky gray" variety, and there's
quite a lot of it in this mode (the dark blue comes more into play in robot
mode)-- I really wish they had used a more metallic shade of the color,
like that used on just the missile launchers on this toy. By now, you should
now whether you like this general color scheme or not. The one new addition
is transparent green on his weapon and a few other bits like his windows.
It's a nice addition, particularly against the gray, and works nicely as
an accent color. That said, almost all of Prime's paint apps-- most of
them silver and yellow-- are on the front of this mode, with some nice
silver grill and window-lining detailing, along with some yellow paint
along the headlights and side windows. (The yellow paint apps on the side
windows are a bit odd, given how his front windows are
    <i>
     green
    </i>
    -- but
otherwise they're fine.) Not many paint apps are visible on the rest of
him, and this is particularly an issue with all that light milky gray on
his back end-- a few paint apps back there really would've livened things
up more, and his wheels also could've used some paint on the hubs as well.
For weaponry, Optimus has got two side-mounted missile launchers in this
mode that have little "claws" that can open up, and each fires a spring-loaded
missile to boot-- they're spiffy little extra weapons. He's also got a
nifty green Star Saber sword with some nice gunmetal gray paint on the
handle, but it just sorta sticks there on top and doesn't really try to
blend in with the silouhette of this mode at all.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode transformation is a tad more complicated than you'd expect, involving
folding in the sides and turning the whole upper section around at the
chest before doing the conventional folding out of his limbs. The end result
looks mighty fine, and is definitely what the primary focus of this design
was all about. Optimus' proportions are beefed up in this mode, even compared
to his previous Prime toys; yes, his head is small proportionally, but
it's meant to be. He's got large, mostly curvy lower arms and legs, with
a couple of nice edges on his shoulders. His chest and waist are particularly
well-done, with the fake spiked bumper and grill/ab detailing looking mighty
cool while his chest is the actual front/top of the truck mode proper.
There's details of fake wheels on the inside of his lower legs, but without
paint on those dark blue pieces, I'm not sure why they bothered. His head
no longer has its signature faceplate deployed, and the smirk/grin looks
a little... off for Optimus, though otherwise his headsculpt is pretty
well-done, with excellent light piping for the eyes. All of this said,
however, his hips and waist do seem a TAD too far up on the toy, but that's
about my only proportional complaint. He's got a bit of a backpack made
up of the front sides of his vehicle mode, but they stay pegged together
and out of the way, so they're a minor issue at best. These little backpack
pieces also serve a purpose-- they've got holes in them perfectly sized
for Optimus' two side-mounted vehicle claw-guns, which can peg into the
lower section of this backpack to look like jet boosters! I LOVE weapons
with dual purposes like that. Obviously, Optimus also has spread-out wings
on his upper back in this mode, though they do stick out from behind his
upper back a tad further than I'd consider ideal. All four wings can splay
out quite well, and they can rotate forward and backwards a bit as well--
in general they're just a nice little add-on to both the toy in general
and Optimus' silhouette in this mode, and they're probably the biggest
selling point of this version of Beast Hunters Optimus over the other molds
of this design. For articulation, Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at two points), wrist rotation, hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and slightly forwards and back at the ankles. (His
waist looks like it can rotate, but unfortunately it can't.) Given his
large feet and good stability, this means Optimus is fairly poseable, particularly
when you take into account how beefy he is. Obviously, Optimus can also
hold his Star Saber or either of his engine-guns in his fist holes in this
mode.

Optimus (the 2013 version) is the best all-around toy of his new upgraded
design, with a stellar robot mode that only has a few very minor issues,
nice articulation, and some pretty cool weaponry and wings. His transformation
is also slightly more involved than the usual "fold out and rotate my appendages
and head into place around my front section" Optimus transformation, which
this Transfan appreciates. His vehicle mode certainly has some obvious
robot mode bits showing, but it's still the mold that has the vehicle mode
looking most obviously like a vehicle in spite of all this. If you're looking
for a Beast Hunters Optimus toy, this guy's your 'bot.

       The moment the distress call sent by
Wheeljack crackles to an abrupt stop, Optimus Prime springs into action.
He orders Autobot Ratchet to overload the ground bridge enough to send
him-- alone-- deep into space to join the fight against Megatron and Predaking.
Ignoring the Autobot scientist's warnings that doing so will fry the bridge,
leaving the Autobots without fast transport on Earth, and Optimus Prime
no way home from space, he leaps into the glowing ring. Instantly, he finds
himself in the swirling chaos of combat, fire lashing the air and smoke
obscuring his optics. In the space of a moment, his warrior's mind grasps
the situation, and he leaps into action, firing every weapon at his command
at Predaking, hoping to give Bumblebee and Wheeljack the time they need
to escape.
