    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Legends class
Blackout toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the origina
Legends class Blackout toy

     Since Grindor looks pretty
much exactly like Blackout in the movie, it appears that Hasbro is trying
different things at different size classes to differentiate Grindor from
his predecessor. Not mostly white like his larger versions, the Legends
class Grindor largely takes the same color scheme as the original Legends
class Blackout toy-- light pale blue with black as a secondary color. The
blue is a shade or two lighter on Grindor, though, so there's that. However,
I do like the neat touch Hasbro added to help differentiate Grindor-- the
"tech markings" (for lack of a better word) that are on the sides of his
vehicle mode. They look pretty dark good, and that particular green/blue
metallic shade complements Grindor's main color very well, despite being
in roughly the same spot on the color wheel. The same green/blue is also
used on Grindor's robot mode in more "normal" paint apps, on the front
of his chest and legs. It helps to break up all the light pale blue quite
well, and keeps him from getting too boring.

     No mold changes have

     Grindor has some pretty
neat "tech marking" paint decals on his vehicle mode, and his color scheme
is a SLIGHT step up from the original Movie Legend Blackout's due to that,
but honestly it's not different enough for anyone but completists to buy
again if they already have the original release of this mold. If you want
to double-dip on this mold, go for one of the repaints that is a bit more
differentiated.
