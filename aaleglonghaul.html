    No, this isn't a solo
release or redeco of the
    <a href="rotflegdevastator.html">
     RotF combining
Legends version
    </a>
    of Long Haul-- this is a completely new non-combining
mold of the same character, at the same class. Yeah, I don't quite get
it either. But regardless, in vehicle mode this versio of Long Haul loosk
pretty good from a frontal or near-frontal view. The mold detailing is
pretty substantial and very crisp on this figure, so all of the relevant
details are there. MOST of the major details are painted as well, sich
as the front grill and window. (The headlights and a couple of smaller
grills/ladders could stand to have some paint on them, though.) When you
look at Long Haul from a side or rear view, however, the illusion of a
solid dump truck starts to fall apart. From a side vewi, it's very obvious
that the unsightly hollow backside of his robot arms form most of the sides,
and the robot head and chest stick out rather obviously from a rear view.
As another minor aside, the three bolts right in the middle of the top
of this mode are also a bit of an eyesore, but that's a minor concern.

    Long Haul's robot mode
is definitely the better of the two modes, and accurately depicts his movie
model quite well, particularly for a toy this small. The proportions are
pretty solid-- with the exception of the hands, which are a tad two-dimensional.
His big, bulky legs, chest, and tire-shoulders work very well with his
general character and look. The amount of paint detailing on the chest
and head is particularly impressive, with even a lot of the more minor
details (such as the red/black stripes near the shoulders) painted in.
As for the general color scheme itself, the light pale green is a bit boring-looking
in vehicle mode without any real contrast colors, but the addition of the
nice milky dark gray plastic for some of the robot parts-- as well as the
more prevalence of black-- helps to break up all that green a bit more.
The shade of red on his shoulders and eyes is also particularly striking.
As for articulation, Long Haul is pretty par-for-the-course for a Legends
figure-- he can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, and SLIGHTLY
back-and-forth at the knees (this point is hindered a bit by his transformation).
So he's a bit posable, but it's not really an emphasis for this toy-- which
is typical for a toy this small.

    Autobot Alliance Legends
class Long Haul is a pretty decent take on the character in robot mode,
but his vehicle mode is as hardly as convincing as the RotF combining Legends
version of him. My advice is, if the vehicle mode and/or combining aspect
of the toy is the most important to you on a Legends class toy, get one
of the versions of Long Haul that combines into Devastator-- if the robot
mode matters to you most, though, go with this version.
