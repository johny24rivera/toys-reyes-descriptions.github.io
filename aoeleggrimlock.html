    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Rippersnapper toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Prime legion Rippersnapper toy

     Well,
this is certainly one of the most bizarre mold re-uses I've ever seen Hasbro
do. A Prime Predacon re-done up as movie Grimlock?! Granted, there are
some similarities-- the alt mode has t-rex-sized arms and legs, a tail,
and sharp teeth-- but pretty much everything else is different. I mean,
Rippersnapper was a shark monster, and the the robot modes of this toy
and movie Grimlock look NOTHING alike. However, putting all that aside
and focusing on the color scheme, this Wal-Mart exclusive carries over
the general color scheme used for most of AoE Grimlock's toys, with a bronzish
color being used as the main plastic color, and with a fair amount of black
in there to provide some contrast and a bit of silver to mix things up
a bit further. The bronze for this version, however, is of a distinctly
more orange-ish shade than a brown-ish shade, and I don't think the lightening
of the color looks all that great. A brown fits the alt mode and general
color scheme better. What's more than that, Grimmersnapper needs some more
paint apps or some different plastic colors to break up the toy (all of
the plastic on the toy IS milky orangish bronze-- all the black is paint).
In robot mode Grimlock looks decent enough in terms of his color makeup,
with the black and silver chest looking pretty good, along with the silver
bits on the sides of the lower legs and the nice light blue eyes. However,
in beast mode the arms, legs, and tail are entirely void of paint, and
the shark fin section doesn't have all that much paint on it, either, making
him look more dull than he should.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Grimlock, though unlike with Rippersnapper,
this mold comes with no weapon accessory this time around.

     I'd only recommend this
toy for Prime Predacon completists or those who can't get find any other
version of Rippersnapper for a decent price. The mold itself and the color
scheme of the toy isn't bad, but it isn't great either, with the bronze
plastic being a slightly uglier, orangish shade compared to most other
AoE Grimlock toys, while the paint is a bit barren in beast mode. The mold
utterly fails at being Grimlock, as well; I'd recommend coming up with
some alternate name for the character if you want to add him to your collection,
and pony up for one of the larger Grimlocks if you want a toy of his Age
of Extinction design.
