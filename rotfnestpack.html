       Battlefield Bumblebee
doesn't even qualify as a repaint. He's the EXACT same as the later releases
of Cannon Bumblebee with the clear blue windows, except for a few minor
changes. First, the front of his shoulder cannons are painted red (whee?);
there's a few VERY minor paint changes, like the Autobot symbol is not
on the front of the hood as opposed to the side, and his crotch is painted
silver instead of metallic blue. Also, his head mold has been changed to
the one used on the
       <a href="prembb.html">
        Premium version
       </a>
       of Bumblebee,
which looks a little small on this mold. Eh.

          Infiltration Soundwave
is a bit of an homage to his
          <a href="g1soundwave.html">
           G1 self
          </a>
          in
terms of color scheme, but he's got some originality in there as well.
He's got a similar (and very attractive) shade of navy blue, being ever-so-slightly
lighter in coloration than his G1 toy, and some black, but a secondary
color in there is another nice shade of fuschia-ish red, which contrasts
quite well with the blue. Soundwave does have some of his G1 silver here
and there too, as well as some really wicked-looking yellow "electric"
paint apps around his robot chest, which really just pop. Add in some other
nice colors like a bit of light orange, light red "re-entry burn" paint
apps on his wings and his transparent red plastic, and Infiltration Soundwave
just looks really attractive to the eye as a whole package.

            The N.E.S.T. Global Alliance
versus pack isn't exactly the best introduction to the subline, being both
repaints, but even considering that it's a somewhat mixed bag, particularly
if you've got the prior versions of either of these toys. Infiltration
Soundwave has a
            <i>
             fantastic
            </i>
            new color scheme, but his mold is unfortunately
mediocre. Battlefield Bumblebee is a bit better of a mold, but he isn't
different from the mold's previous release in any meaningful way. If you
don't have either of the previous versions of these molds, this is a mildly
recommended set. If you DO have these molds already-- particularly if you
already have Bumblebee (which, let's face it, is extremely likely at this
point)-- I'd only recommend you pick up this set either at a hefty discount
or if you just HAVE to have that Recon Ravage (as purchasing this set is
the only way you can get it in the U.S.)

              When Soundwave discovered the human
operatives of the N.E.S.T. Global Alliance tracking him with their primitive
radar, he decided to take care of the intrusion personally. He plummets
through the atmosphere, his wings glowing red from the heat of reentry.
Little does he know, however, that the humans' primary defender-- Bumblebee--
waits below him, his cannons charged, and eager for a fight.
