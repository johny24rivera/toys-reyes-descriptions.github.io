    Battle Charger Sideswipe,
in fitting with the Battle Charger look, has a very "chubbified" vehicle
mode to help him look (and be) more kid-friendly. I have to admit though
that the chubbified proportions of the Chevy Centennial Corvette don't
look as hot as a chubbified
    <a href="batchbumbee.html">

    or
summat. It's just already an incredibly dynamic, sleek car that it doesn't
look that great all scrunched up like this. However, all the necessary
mold details (and pretty much no more) are present to make him look like
a kiddy version of the Centennial Corvette. Oddly, the tires are the most
detailed, with some really nice bolt detailing om the rims, given the target
audience. This version of Sideswipe is lacking the sweet metallic silver
of the
    <a href="rotfsideswipe.html">
     deluxe version
    </a>
    , sadly, which makes
him look rather boring in comparison. Light milky gray does not an attractive
color scheme make, though at least the painted headlights, taillights,
and windows help to breka it up a little bit. The blue used for the windows
is a particularly nice shade-- I wish they'd use it more often on mainline
toys.

    As with other Battle
Chargers, Sideswipe's gimmick has to do with pulling the toy back and letting
it go-- it'll travel forward for a while, and if it bumps into a wall (or
if you just press in on the front bumper), the upper part of the car will
rotate around, revealing the upper half of the robot in question. No electronics
though. The robot "mode" (i.e., the robot sticking out of the top of the
car mode) is detailed fairly well-- I'm surprised that even the little
head Cyberglyph is on there. In the interest of kid-friendliness, though,
the head and hands are bigger proportionally. The blades are large without
being overly sharp, and his chest details look particularly good curved
like they are. I don't like how his face is detailed, though-- the eyes
and mouth just look "off" somehow even considering the bigger proportions.
As far as articulation goes, like other Battle Chargers, due to the transformation
Sideswipe can move his lower arms in a little and his head down a little,
but they immediately spring back to their default position once you let
go, sadly.

    Battle Charger Sideswipe
is a fairly boring Battle Charger, having just light gray plastic making
up the majority of his color scheme (though that's broken up adequately
enough on his robot mode bits, along with some silver paint apps). The
dynamic curves of the Centennial Corvette are also rather ruined by the
chubby proportions of the vehicle. If you have a kid who's too young for
even a Fast Action Battler he might be worth it, but otherwise it's an
easy skip, even for completists.

      Sideswipe knows how to fight, and that's
pretty much all. He lives to charge into action against the Decepticons
with his blades flashing. He's fast, determined, and devoted to continue
the fight until every Decepticon is destroyed.
