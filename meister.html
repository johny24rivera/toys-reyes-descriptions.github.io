    Meister's vehicle mode
is a Mazda RX-8. (By the way, in case you're wondering why Meister wasn't
just called Autobot Jazz, the head designer, Aaron Archer, said he wanted
to try something a bit different for this guy, since "Autobot ____" sounded
kinda silly.) Anyways, as you'd expect from an Alternator, Meister has
a pretty much flawless vehicle mode. The proportions are perfect, the headlights
and tailights look perfect, the colors go together well, the doors open,
the interior seats, adjust, and the like. One slight downside is that the
bottom of Meister's arms tend to stick out a bit below the front bumper.
Again, it's not TOO obvious, but it does retract from the vehicle mode's
real-ness just a tad. Given Meister's design similarity to Alternator

    -- even though he
is a completely different mold-- I suppose it's also only appropriate to
draw an important comparison when we're talking about detailing-- the back
seats in the interior of the car now look like actual seats, whereas in
the Subaru Alternators, they were more obviously the upper robot legs.
So that's a definite plus. Also, if you lift up the hood, you'll notice
that there's now mechanical detailing on the inside, not an engine-weapon--
this is because Meister's robot mode weapon is made out of his muffler
instead.

    Again, because of the
design similarity, Meister has a very similar transformation to Smokescreen
&amp; Silverstreak, and a very similar look in robot mode. He also has
pretty much the exact same articulation as his predecessors, as well. A
couple of important details are different, however. For one, I like the
design of the legs on Meister MUCH better. They're nice, fairly stiff ratcheting
joints that bend more like real legs, whereas with the legs on Smokescreen
and Silverstreak, you almost had to bend them backwards at the knees to
get them to stand fairly straight. So that's a pretty sizable plus, there.
The transformation back to car mode is also noticeably easier, as the leg
pieces have a more obvious position they're supposed to be in when transforming
him back-- this wasn't the case with Smokescreen/Silverstreak. The car
roof on Meister's back also folds up some so it doesn't hang quite so low--
in contrast, Smokescreen and Silverstreak's roof didn't fold up, but part
of the roof was connected to their robot legs instead of back, so it didn't
need to. The face, of course, is also completely different, and a spot-on
representation of
    <a href="jazz.html">

    . In fact, if you look
closely, behind his visor, you can see two normal optics-- a really cool
detail. There are a few flaws apparent on Meister that aren't there on
Smokescreen and Silverstreak, however.
For one, the gun looks rather weak--
it's completely hollow on one side, for one, which makes it unpleasantly
asymmetrical, and it doesn't fit into Meister's hand very well, and this
can be a little annoying. Also, the arms are held to the chest by pegs
this time, and although the pegs aren't so shallow that they'll come out
if you just move the arms, sometimes the arms will pop off during transformation.
The front parts of his feet also fold down instead of down and out like
on Smokescreen/Silverstreak, and I think this doesn't look quite as good.
Still, this mode is really top-notch in nearly all respects, so these minor
downsides are easily overlooked.

    Meister is one of the
best Alternators around, and about on par with Silverstreak. His color
scheme, while not the most original, is a good one, and certainly fitting
for the character. He has a few very minor flaws, but they are nothing
compared to the excellent details, articulation, proportions, and design
on this toy. Very highly recommended.
