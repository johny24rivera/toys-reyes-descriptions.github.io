    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" voyager Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read

     Optimus Prime's partially
translucent color scheme for this version of him is likely inspired by
the several Japanese "Fire Guts" redecos of his various versions over the
years, though the colors are a bit closer to his normal scheme than the
actual "almost-all-orange" Fire Guts Prime toys. The transparent red used
for most of his fromt cab section/upper body is a really nice, eye-catching
shade of the color, being pretty much the exact color of a cherry lollipop.
The blue used on this version is significantly lighter and more pastel
than the blue on other versions of this character, and gives Prime a nice
light, solid color to contrast against his mostly darker color scheme.
Even more eye-popping are the translucent orange on the windows and part
of his Powerizer weapon, which looks both solid, partially transparent,
and fluorescent at the same time. It would appear, from first glance, that
most of his "robot-specific" parts like his upper legs and chest are black,
along with a good portion of his Powerizer weapon, his front grill, and
the section above his windows. In actuality, only the wheels are a "pure"
black-- the rest of his "black" parts are actually either a very very dark
blue, or a very very dark blue with a hint of green thrown in as well.
Given how much this toy strays from primary colors, this is actually one
of the few instances in which I prefer the slightly-tinted, "impure" black
to the purer kind, as it's in keeping with his overall color scheme and
complements his light pale blue a bit better. There's a few other accent
apps, like the silver on his rear-view mirrors and face and dull yellow
headlights, but the vast majority of his colors are one of the aformentioned
colors-- he actually has comparatively few paint apps, but given how much
of him is transparent I actually prefer it this way, since otherwise it
would look too visually crowded. He's also got a nifty "gold shield" paint
app behind the Autobot symbol on his truck's nose, which markes him as
a "Dark Energon Defender" in this exclusive assortment-- it's a nice extra
little unique touch.

     Believe it or not, Dark
Energon Defender Prime actually has a mold change when compared to the
mass retail version of this mold-- the head is a different sculpt, with
Optimus' mouth showing instead of his usual faceplate. It's all sculpted
quite well, and gives him a touch more uniqueness and expression.

     Dark Energon Defender
Optimus Prime has a really eye-catching color scheme that's quite original
and pops, while still being similar enough to Prime's traditional colors
where it's still definitively Optimus. His translucent colors-- the orange
in particular-- are fantastic, and the pastel blue and bluish black complement
each other while contrasting nicely against said translucent colors. This
is as good-looking as this mold's going to get, folks.

       Optimus Prime has seen Megatron use
Dark Energon before, but never like this, and never with such total command
of its abilities. He knows that he must put a stop to this evil before
its corruption forever taints the Earth, and before its power overwhelms
his small team of Autobots.
