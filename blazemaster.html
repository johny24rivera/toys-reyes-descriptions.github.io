    Blazemaster here is a
helicopter. A news helicopter, to be more precise-- I'm pretty sure he's
the first TF news helicopter ever. His vehicle mode is very solid, with
great proportions (except for the oversized propeller blades, likely to
abide by safety regulations). His robot head can be seen somewhat easily
inside his transparent cockpit windows, but other than that he has no robot
mode extras, either. His navy-blue and gold color scheme works fairly well,
both being original and rather realistic. It's not mind-blowing by any
means-- and most of the gold is gold plastic, sadly, not gold paint-- but
it definitely works, and the white provides a great accent color. His action
gimmick has to do with his propeller-- pressing in on the transparent blue
tab on the side of it causes it to spin pretty well, though it does occasionally
come off while spinning-- the propeller's connection to the rest of the
vehicle mode isn't the best. Blazemaster also has three little landing
gear, all three retractable and with actual spinning wheels on the bottom,
which is impressive at this scale. (And speaking of scale, that's Blazemaster's
main downside in this mode-- he's pretty small for a deluxe. I realize
he's compact in this mode as well, but still...)

    Blazemaster's transformation
is rather confusing and complex simply for the sake of being complex, it
seems. When you're done, you won't be sure you've done it right-- but sadly,
you have. Blazemaster's robot mode, is, quite frankly, an absolute mess.
It's honestly hard to find ANY positives about this mode. The arms are
practically non-existent, being just halves of the top of his vehicle mode
folded together, with only a discernable thumb. The rotor halves hang limply
off his hands, and fall off at the slightest provocation. His shoulder/elbow
articulation is extremely odd... it's hard to explain without visually
showing, but they're connecting by thin horizontal panels to the main body,
almost like his shoulders/elbows are facing the wrong way-- and they have
extremely limited articulation to boot. Plus, their ball joints easily
pop off. The main body isn't much better, being just a mish-mash of various
panels of the fromt of Blazemaster's vehicle mode that don't really lock
anywhere and just get in the way. The window cockpit halves near the sides
of his head are especially annoying. The way his tail rotors fold up behind
his head would make for a nice backpack design that would accentuate his
overall design-- if the backpack actually plugged into anything to keep
it stable. Instead it constantly falls backwards and never really feels
like a "part" of the main body's back as it should. His legs are the best
part of his robot mode, but they're still very odd. The knees are FAR too
low on the leg, and look very odd. He's also got tiny feet, so he can't
stand up very easily. As far as articulation goes, he can move at the head,
shoulders (at three points), the base of each thumb, and at the hips, knees
(at two points), ankles, and a swivel about halfway between the knee and
hip. However, this sounds like a lot more articulation that he's actually
got, due to all the aforementioned pieces of floppy kibble and instability.
About the only pluses I can muster up to say about this mode are that the
mold sculpting on the robot parts is quite good, with little things like
pistons and cylinders in all the right places. His head sculpt is also
very well-done and sharp, too. Oh, and his color scheme is good, but I
said that already about his vehicle mode.

    Every line has a stinker
or two, and Blazemaster is one of Revenge of the Fallen's. He's got a great,
nicely-proportioned vehicle mode and a nice color scheme, but don't be
fooled-- his robot mode is a shambly, mis-proportioned, kibbly, fall-apart
mess that has practically no redeeming features whatsoever. Not recommended
except for completists.

      There are a lot of Autobots who think
Blazemaster is a little haywire. He likes to hover over Decepticon squads,
letting them notice him, and relying on his defensive systems to protect
him from their fire. It isn't until his targets notice him that he drops
his payload of corrosive gel right on their heads. Watching a bunch of
Decepticons break into a panicked sprint while their armor smokes and melts
is what he lives for.
