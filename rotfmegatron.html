    The Movie versions of
Megatron have always have not just abstract vehicle modes, but ones that
honestly look lazily put-together, and this new tank version of Megatron
sadly doesn't break that feeling that the first version of the character
had. His tank mode isn't "of Earth"-- and I'm fine with that-- but what
I'm not fond of is how it's really just a bunch of robot parts cobbled
together for the main body with a turret and treads, and that makes it
a "tank". The main body doesn't look solid at all, and looks just like
what it is-- a bunch of hinges and bolts to compress the robot body into
the space in between the couple of identifiable "tank" parts of this mode.
Still, to be fair, it IS a more convincing mode than the
    <a href="movleadermegatron.html">
     first
Leader Megatron's
    </a>
    alt mode, due to their not being any huge pieces
of robot kibble that stick out and outright ruin the silouhette of the
mode. Megatron's robot head sticks out very obviously form the front underneath
the turret, but this time it's intentional, as it was this way in the movie,
as well. Granted, I wish they had given Megatron more of a bonafide "battle
mask" for this version as opposed to two stubs of plastic in front of his
jaw, but eh. The turret looks pretty cool, and pressing on the light red
button will fire a spring-loaded missile out of it, but sadly the turret
can't move at all-- it's stuck in place, which is simply unacceptable on
this large of a toy. The rocket boosters on the back end also seemed tacked-on,
as those pieces don't mesh with the pieces in front of it at all, and in
fact sit at a slight angle when connected, which looks odd. The turrets
look very well-done-- even split into two parts on each side as they are--
with very "sharp"-looking detailing, and some really nice metallic silver
and copper paint detailing on the interior. It's a rare eye-catching part
on what is otherwise a wholly boring color scheme, with that too-often-used
dull milky gray on the vast majority of the figure with black being the
only other major color. More of the metallic copper and light red, please.
The mold detailing is VERY well-done, though, with metallic shards and
plating sticking out everywhere on the toy.

    Megatron's robot mode
is an improvement over the tank mode, and is certainly what the toy was
built around, but still falls short of being impressive, sadly. His main
problem has to do with his proportions-- he has a definite hunchback, which
is not accurate to how he looks in the actual movie. His legs are also
a bit overly large, and though his arms are a bit asymmetrical in their
size in the movie to give him a bit of that "rebuilt" look, they aren't
nearly THIS symmetrical. His right gun-arm is absolutely HUGE, reading
down almost to his foot when extended, while his right arm is a tiny twig
of a thing, with his middle finger extended much farther than his other
claws-- which honestly makes it hard to make him look like he's NOT giving
you the bird. On the plus side, though, I do like the "one big/one little
shoulder"-- that's a GOOD kind of asymmetry, in my opinion-- and the detail
given this main body is phenomenal. It looks like he has an intricate metal-shard-ribcage
there, and if you press down on the bronze piece in the center, you can
see several gears inside his chest turn as flashing red lights come on
in his head and upper body while he roars "I...AM...MEGATRON!" A really
nicely-done gimmick, there. I don't like the paint apps on Megs' face,
though-- they make him look like he has some sort of bull nose-ring and
liberally-applied mascara, which just looks wrong. Besides his aforementioned
missile-firing gimmick, Megatron's big claw on his right arm can also rotate
forward, and if you press backward on the black lever near the back of
his claw, a blade will swing downward automatically, which is also rather
neat. In addition, when you rotate his right arm around at the shoulder,
ever 90 degrees or so a "pounding" sound will emit from the toy, along
with the blinking red lights. This, honestly, can get a little annoying
if you just want to move his arm, as there's no way to deactivate it short
of taking out the batteries. Despite the fact that they're oversized a
bit, Megatron's legs are constructed quite well, with wide feet that keep
him quite stable and pretty silver-painted kneecaps. (There's two big black
pegs sticking out of the insides of his knees that are minor eyesores,
though.) As far as Megatron's articulation goes, he can move at the shoulders
(two points on the right, three points on the left), elbow on the left
arm, at the base of the middle finger on the left arm, and at the hips
(at three points), knees, and slight side-to-side movement at the neck.
As such, although it's not horrible, Megatron isn't exactly particularly
posable, particularly on his huge right arm due to the gimmicks housed
there.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    RotF Leader Megatron
is one of the weaker toys of the line, what with his "bunch-of-parts-with-a-turret-and-treads"
tank mode and a robot mode that has some definite proportion and articulation
problems. His color scheme is also a snoozer, too. Still, he's the only
RotF Leader-class toy that isn't difficult to transform, so at least he
has that going for him, along with some cool gimmicks and excellent mold
detailing. Still, if you're going to get one version of this character,
the Voyager-class version of this guy is an easy recommendation over this
less-accurate and more-expensive version.

        This time around, Megatron
is a tank. His voyager form has some wings to imitate that he still has
some properties of being a jet and that he flies in ROTF, but those are
absent from this Megatron. Mold wise, there is a ton of detailing on this
guy, and I don't mind the head being visible all that much. I mean, think
about all the Cybertronian forms we have seen thus far.

        all
have had heads/battle masks visible in their vehicle modes. Voyager Megatron's
head has a better facemask, however if it REALLY bothers you, you can push
Megatron's head so it is facing downwards. Anyways, back to the tank. Paint
is okay, would have been nice to have more silver paint but seeing as to
how costly that could be, I can see why they avoided it. My main problem
with the tank is that it is too high, and doesn't have enough armor shell
on the top. Other than that though, its resembles a tank more than the
original Megatron resembled a jet, so that's good. In terms of features,
you can press a button to fire a missile, which makes a firing noise and
causes lights to appear. The only lights you see in this mode are two red
panels and Megatron's eyes, though.

       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Robot mode is slightly
better. Let's get the negatives out of the way first, of which I have three.
Firstly, his head barely has any side-to-side articulation. I know this
is because of his gimmick which I will explain later, but still. Next,
I know he is a big toy, but I think he could have been larger, taller.
He dwarfs Prime in the movie, so I would have liked to achieve that here.
My third complaint is my biggest-- the arms. His left arm is barely an
arm, more of a stick. This is not at all accurate to his Movie counterpart,
who had normal-sized arms, just asymmetric in details. His other arm is
a giant log, practically useless as it can only rotate 360 degrees at the
shoulder, and go outwards slightly when the attack blade is attached to
his upper arm. His little blade thing can move downwards on the arm and
flip out, which is nice, but not movie-accurate at all. The cannon still
fires, but to activate the sound, you have to rotate the arm past a certain
point. Strange. That aside, lets get on with the positives. His torso and
legs are WONDERFUL. Good articulation and amazing detail. And a neat thing
to note, Megatron's chest actually looks like The Fallen's face, well most
of it anyway. In terms of sounds besides the gun, he has a transformation
noise when you rotate the hips downward during transformation, and when
you pull down the lever on his chest, he says "I am Megatron," In a drawn
out, creepy, loud voice. So for those of you that want to repaint this
guy into a Galvatron, you may want to reconsider. Also, when you pull down
that lever, tons of gears in his chest move for his Mech Alive, which is
very awesome. Probably the best mech alive gimmick of the Decepticons.

        All in all, Megatron
is not too fantastic of a figure. If you don't care about scale, I'd say
get the voyager version, but if you have the utterly fantastic Leader Prime,
you don't really have much of a choice, this guy is a must.

           Rebuilt with parts cannibalized from
other Decepticons, Megatron rises once again to lead his army. Though the
Allspark destroyed him once, he can now feel its power coursing through
his circuitry. It calls him to seize his rightful place as ruler over the
puny planet on which he was imprisoned and destroyed, and from which he
will launch his conquest of the universe. Optimus Prime is all that stands
between him and victory, and the Autobot leader has done a poor job of
hiding himself. At long last, Megatron knows exactly where his enemy is,
and he has power enough to destroy him.
