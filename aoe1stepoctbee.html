    Bumblebee's "old school"
Camaro alt mode is replicated somewhat faithfully for the 1-step changer
version, though some proportional sacrifices were made for the transformation
gimmick. Namely, this mode is a bit taller proportionally when compared
to its length, and the front hood isn't quite as long as it should be.
These are overall fairly minor issues, but noticeable, and they give the
car mode a slightly "chibi" look to it. The robot feet are also fairly
obvious on the back end; even moreso because they're painted, and there's
a bit of... something... inside the side windows (it's the sides of his
robot chest, but not identifiable as such in this mode). Otherwise, this
mode is extra-free. There are some pretty noticeable "crease" lines in
the front hood that break up that otherwise smooth area due to the transformation
gimmick-- a bit unsightly, but not a huge deal, particularly considering
the age range this line is aimed at. (They're also less of an eyesore given
that the plastic is black.) Speaking of the color scheme, it's your classic
"Stealth 'Bee" reverse colors scheme, with black being the main color this
time around and yellow being an accent. I've always liked this scheme better
than Bumblebee's usual, though the yellow is a bit different on this one-step
changer when compared to the
    <a href="aoeoctbee.html">
     deluxe version
    </a>
    --
the yellow on this is a bit more of a glossy, darker "mustard" yellow compared
to the usual orangish "cheese" yellow on most movie Bumblebee toys. The
metallic silvery blue used for the front and rear(!) windows is a pretty
nice shade and ideal for windows-- not to mention that it helps split up
the black, which is definitely needed in the middle part of this mode.
The front grill paint app doesn't have the little lines around the thick
line like on the deluxe-- it's just one thick line, but I don't particularly
mind. The "SS" letters are still on the side of said front grill, though.
The mold detailing is fairly minimal in this mode, due to the fairly streamlined
nature of the Camaro alt mode, though the mold detailing on the tires is
quite good-- same with the front grill.

    Bumblebee has the same
nifty "switchblade" transformation as
    <a href="aoe1stepdrift.html">
     one-step
changer car Drift
    </a>
    , so most of my issues with his robot mode are the
same as with that Drift mold. That is, the arms are a bit small proportionally,
the head a bit small in comparison to the wide chest, and although the
legs aren't bad (though a tad chunky), the entire side of his body and
legs is hollow, which makes 'Bee look rather bad from a side-angle; best
to keep your sights on him from a front angle, where he still looks fairly
decent. Also as with Drift, the only articulation is at the shoulders (at
two points)-- though again, articulation isn't really the point of the
one-step changer subline (though there's even
    <i>
     molded-in ratchets
    </i>
    at the elbows, though they don't work even though they look like they should).
Bumblebee's mold detailing is quite impressive in this mode, with his chest
and arms in particular filled with tons of movie-accurate details, like
the fake "gas cap" and license plate detailing on the crotch, the fake
pistons on the abdomen, the fake car chest-halves, and the familiar movie
Bumblebee arm detailing. Bumblebee's also armed to fight in this mode--
one of his arms has a blade sticking out behind the wrist (and painted
in a rather nice metallic blue to boot), while the other is molded in its
cannon mode. Bumblebee's facesculpt-- as good as it is-- is in its "normal"
configuration, even though with his weapons out like this you'd expect
it to be "mask down". There's also an impressive amount of detailing on
the backside-- impressive particularly because that part's not even readily
visible in either mode, but it's got flat facsimiles of Bumblebee's door-wings
and leg details molded in. As for the colors, the robot mode bits-- the
arms and stomach, specifically-- add in another color with a brownish gray.
I guess it's supposed to make Bumblebee look "dirty" or perhaps more metallic?
The problem is, they should've picked a metallic shade if they wanted to
convey this. As is, it's not bad, but more traditional metal-like colors
would have worked better. The paint apps are plentiful on the fake car-chest
and the head, but some of Bumblebee's other mold detailing-- like the detailing
on his waist, hips, and on his arms-- is begging for some paint.

    The one-step version
of "High Octane" Bumblebee certainly has some issues-- the robot mode proportions
can be a bit wonky if looked at from the side in particular-- but by and
large it's an addictive transformation gimmick, looks pretty good in vehicle
mode, and even in robot mode he looks pretty good from the front for a
one-step changer, small arms and head not withstanding. I do love the "switchblade"
transformation style started with one-step Drift and am glad to see it
replicated on 'Bee-- this one-step version of 'Bee certainly looks much
better than his
