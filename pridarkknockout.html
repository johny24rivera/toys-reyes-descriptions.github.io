    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe Prime
Knock Out toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original deluxe Prime Knock Out toy

     Knock Out's color scheme
doesn't reference any particular past Transformer-- for this redeco, it's
just meant to be something a bit different. And boy, is it! Whereas the
original usage of this mold had a rather dull red-and-gray color scheme,
this redeco is one of the most eye-poppingest of any Prime toy, with the
major plastic color being a transparent green that's pretty much the exact
same color as a sour apple lollipop. Combine that with his windows and
headlights being a transparent purple that's also the exact same color
as a grape lollipop, and I feel the need for a Jolly Rancher or something
every time I look at him. These two transparent colors in particular just
REALLY pop and contrast excellently. There's also a fair amount of black
on the vehicle mode, such as on the roof, a nice stripe down the center
of the hood, and is the color for some nifty diagonally-stretched Decepticon
symbols with wings on Knock Out's side doors. As with the other Decepticon
Dark Energon redecos, Knock Out also has a nifty "light metallic violet
X" slash mark behind his Decepticon symbol, and it contrasts well against
the black. A few more light green and moderately light purple paint apps
round out his vehicle mode. Both complement their plastic colors fairly
well, though the light green is used to paint over plastic that isn't apple
green, to help keep the entire main portion of the car mode green. However,
it's a noticeably different, lighter shade-- thus it looks a little off,
though it's not used SO much that this becomes a major eyesore. Gray shows
up more in robot mode. The gray isn't all that boring, though, as it's
of a darker shade than the usual light milky gray, and looks a bit semi-metallic
as a result. Also more obvious in robot mode is a fair amount of dark dull
bluish purple, which is an interesting color that's about halfway between
black and a dark purple-- thus complementing both of those colors while
also varying Knock Out's color palette a bit more.

     "Dark Energon" Knock
Out takes a pretty medicore mold and pumps up the color scheme to 11, with
a really unique layout that pops while also fitting the whole "transparent
colored plastic" schtick that the Dark Energon subline has. This is one
of the best and most original redecos I've ever seen, particularly in comparison
to how dull the original use of this mold is-- if you don't care about
show accuracy, I'd recommend this version of Knock Out over any other toy
of him.

       Knock Out doesn't often test weapons
himself-- the danger of a catastrophic malfunction is just too great. But
when he saw the power granted by Dark Energon, he just had to have a taste.
Now he's amped up and ready to bring the hurt to the Autobots.
