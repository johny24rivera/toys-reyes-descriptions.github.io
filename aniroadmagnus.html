    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated Ultra
Magnus. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Roadbuster Ultra Magnus
is a repaint homage to G1 Roadbuster, who had a similar alt mode and color
scheme. However, the redeco itself is still all Magnus, and there's no
mistaking him for another character, as he still has his trademark blue,
albeit in vastly decreased amounts-- only his transparent bits, his robot
head, and the side panels on his waist retain his blue color. The rest
is mostly a mix of dull orange and green. It's rather fitting for a miliary
vehicle, and when mixed with a decent amount of black (particularly on
the core of the robot mode), it looks good. However, orange and green,
while not outright clashing, just don't go together nearly as well as this
toy's original color scheme of white and blue. Maybe putting in some more
of those nice silver or yellow paint apps would've helped, but as is, uh-uh.
Plus, orange and green just don't seem to be very "Magnus-y" colors at
all. The transparent &amp; dark blue bits--the only "Magnus-y" bits left--
look particularly out of place on such a miliary-inspired color scheme,
and almost outright clash against the green.

     No mold changes have
been made to Roadbuster Ultra Magnus (his electronic sounds are the same
as well).

     Roadbuster Ultra Magnus
is a pretty disappointing repaint, even given the G1 Roadbuster homage.
They either should've remolded the head and removed the blue parts, making
it a completely different character, or used a completely different color
scheme, if you ask me. Going halfway like this just doesn't work. Only
get this version if you absolutely can't find the original for a reasonable
price.

       Following his experiences on Earth,
the most powerful Autobot warrior became stronger and more cunning than
ever before. The tactics that Ultra Magnus used to employ on the battlefield
were textbook Autobot Academy stratagems. Battling on Earth made him realize
that the fight against the Decepticons would take more than Academy programming
to win. To achieve final victory, the Autobots will need to fight smart,
or they might as well not fight at all.
