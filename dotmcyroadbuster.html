    Roadbuster's Cyberverse
toy has as its vehicle mode the "Stealth Force" version, i.e. there's guns
and robotic detailing popping out everywhere, in a sort of "starting to
transform" kind of way. It's quite faithful to how he looked in the movie,
even at this scale-- the mold detailing is incredibly impressive, with
little missile pods, the exposed engine exhaust pipes, armored fenders
on the sides and front, and the like all OVER this toy. Fortunately, all
this mold detailing is also backed up with a lot of paint detailing for
a Legion-class toy-- the windows are all painted, as is the engine, parts
of the white "stripe" on the sides, the "88" numbers on his roof and sides,
and some white detailing with his Chevrolet symbol on the front end. There's
even little NASCAR emblems to the sides of his exposed engine! Given all
this, and the fact that there's no robot mode extras in this mode and the
proportions look pretty accurate, it's hard for me to say anything negative
about this mode-- it's an excellent recreation of the design at such a
small scale. The color scheme of dark green, white, and dark milky gray/metallic
gunmetal gray works decently well, with the white contrasting against the
green excellently and the gray serving as a nice neutral color. The dark
milky gray is even of a semi-metallic shade, too, so it doesn't look boring
like many other movie toys' grays. Plus, Roadbuster's little chainsaw weapon
can flip out on a balljoint from the left side of this mode for a "racing"
weapon! At this scale, how cool is that?

    Roadbuster's transformation
is very basic and straightforward, but it accomplishes what it needs to.
Unfortunately, Roadbuster's robot mode has those "overly flat arms/hands
molded onto the inside of the car doors" issue, but this is very common
with Cyberverse toys. Otherwise, proportionally he looks good, though his
shoulders are a tad wide (or his chest a tad narrow, take your pick). The
only piece of vehicle "kibble" in this mode is the front of Roadbuster's
car mode on his upper back, but it stays out of the way of movement and
doesn't look particularly unsightly, so I don't mind it. His chainsaw can
still be wielded in this mode, connected to his lower left arm as it is--
and his missile launchers are in the right place on his shoulders, even
with this simplistic transformation. Roadbuster's mold detailing is still
incredibly intricate in this mode, particularly on the chest and head,
which look great and have ample paint detailing (even his tiny visor is
painted dark metallic blue). However, his other robot parts don't fare
so well in the paint department, with his legs basically bereft of the
stuff, as are the insides of his robot arm/car door pieces. This toy's
articulation
is pretty average for a Legion figure; he can move at the shoulders, hips,
and knees, with the former two being on ball joints.

    Roadbuster looks pretty
great in both modes (particularly his vehicle mode), has a neat little
chainsaw weapon, lots of paint detailing overall, and few proportional
issues, particularly for the size class. Recommended if you like the Cyberverse-scaled
toys; he doesn't break the mold in terms of innovation, but this one's
definitely one of the best Legion molds from the line.
