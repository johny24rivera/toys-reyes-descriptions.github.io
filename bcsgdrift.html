    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Drift. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Drift

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Shattered Glass Drift's
color scheme may at first simply seem like the amounts of red and white
on him have been reversed, but he's actually an homage to the popular fourth-wall-breaking
Marvel character Deadpool! (It actually makes quite a bit sense, as the
opposite of a silent ninja is probably a smack-talking mercenary with no
real code of honor.) Once you realize where "Driftpool's" color scheme
comes from, this toy does a great job of emanating Deadpool's color scheme
while still making SG Drift his own thing. The red and black are primary
shades of the color that go very well together, and the black-outlined
white detailing-- particularly in vehicle mode-- looks great, with the
"rays" on the sides of the car looking like the Japanese "sun" symbol,
with the sun being the front tires in this instance. Those are some really
creative details there, though Drift's Japanese character on his front
hood makes considerably less sense. Apparently it means "decisive", or
summat like that. Not really sure how that applies to Driftpool, but whatever--
at least it looks cool, and fits with his Japanese drifter car alt mode.
Drift's transparent plastic is so dark as to be almost black, which is
fine by me-- not only does this mean it's hard to make out the robot bits
on the inside, but it also goes well with the black-painted rear windows.
The black lines down the sides of his car front are also great details,
both looking like sword tips while hearkening back to certain aspects of
Deadpool's costume. It also love how clean the white and black paint apps
are on Drift's face-- they look quite striking against the red head, and,
in another callback to Deadpool, Drift has completely white eyes.

     No mold changes have
technically been made to Shattered Glass Drift, but in addition to the
large sword and two smaller swords that the mold comes with, this toy ALSO
comes with the
     <a href="genblurr.html">
      Blurr remold's
     </a>
     two smaller guns.
Due to the molding, they can't be sheathed in the car doors, but it's nice
for Drift to have both guns and swords, just like Deadpool.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Shattered Glass Drift
is a pretty nice nod to Deadpool, but even ignoring that it's a great mold
with a color scheme that not only looks good, but does some pretty neat
things (like the "rising sun" paint apps on the sides of the car mode).
Highly recommended.

       Even amongst the villainous hordes of
the Evil Autobots, Drift is considered the most ruthless. Laws and morality
have no stay with him, only money and profit... and occasionally thrills.
He'd blast his own batch initators if he were paid for the job. Or if he
thought it might be fun. Typically given free rein by the Autobot leader,
Optimus Prime, to complete his objectives, Drift's methods of taking out
his targets are only limited by his imagination. In other words, they are
almost boundless. The mercenary relishes dreaming of new ways of taking
out his marks, and logging them when he reboots in the morning. Regardless
of the elaborate traps he might set, he always ensures that he is there
at the final move, with his finger on the trigger or his hand on the blade.
