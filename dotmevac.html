    Available only at the

     Transformers:

    </i>
    "N.E.S.T." giftshop, this deluxe-sized version of Evac is
thus a bit more expensive and a little difficult to obtain if you can't
go to either of the Universal Studios parks. Evac's vehicle mode is a bit
abstract, being a very curved-front car with a rather tall back. It's a
close replica of the "car" you ride in in the Transformers Ride, where
you're a passenger inside Evac as he drives you around past various 3-D
screens in a rather intense chase sequence. It's a pretty darned cool idea
to have your ride be a Transformer himself. Under Evac's large window,
you can see four seats molded inside, which is a pretty nice touch, even
if a bit inaccurate (the actual "Evac" you ride in has no front windshield,
and there's rows of seats with bars in front of them, not individual seats).
The seats are a bit undersized proportionally, but otherwise, this mode
looks pretty nice and unique. Of course, it's not remotely realistic, so
I can't really compare it much to an actual car, but the sweeping mold
detailing is pretty unique, and things like the front fender and the wheels
are quite generous with such detailing. As far as paint detailing, Evac
could've stood to have a bit more in this mode; his headlights are painted,
along with his wheel hubs and parts of his robot feet. There's also a REALLY
neat metallic green deco on each side of the vehicle mode that helps break
up Evac's color scheme immensely, contrasting very well with the dark blue
and making an otherwise fairly vanilla color scheme (dark blue with gray
and black) into a bit more eye-catching of a scheme. I only wish they had
used this green on more of the figure. As far as extras, from a straight-on
side view, you can see his lower arms, though from most other angles they're
hidden from view. The robot feet are VERY blatant on the upper back end,
though, and the shoulders can be seen rather obviously from this end--
though at least there's a silver "turbo engine" exhaust port on the back
end so that it's not entirely made up of robot mode extras. Of note is
that you can lift up the sides of Evac's car mode in a similar manner to
how you get into the Transformers Ride, but if you do that in this mode
it only exposes a lot more robot extras, so it's best not to.

    Evac's robot mode transformation
is slightly more complex than the simple "folding out" of his vehicle mode
that it appears to be-- his head swivels around on the same piece that
forms his back exhaust port, and his entire chest and legs swivel around.
The end result, however, is fairly generic, and throws away a lot of what
made Evac look unique in his vehicle mode. It's a pretty standard movie-former
in terns of his looks, having entirely too much gray in this mode with
the vehicle front as his chest. His face sculpt is spot-on, but it looks
way too much like a blue movie Sideswipe's to me, and thus doesn't really
lend him much characterization, either (the yellow eyes against the blue
head, though, look great). His proportions are generally quite good, and
most of his vehicle mode extras are on a backpack that's fairly large but
largely stays out of the way of articulation, at least. The wheels on his
knees do get in the way of movement a bit,Â  though the wheels on his
shoulders help make him look a bit more buff and don't get in the way of
anything. The robot mold detailing is excellent, with things like beams,
coils, and hinges molded in all the appropriate places, though I wish a
bit more of his gray had been painted silver for the sake of visual interest.
He has four C-clip points in this mode; two on the sides of his lower arms,
and two on top of his shoulders. He doesn't have any actual handheld weapons
or other accessories, which makes him feel slightly incomplete, even with
the guns molded into the sides of his lower arms. For articulation, Evac
can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows, hips, knees,
and side-to-side at the ankles. Although alright, this is a bit below-par
for a deluxe; having some elbow or knee rotation really would've helped
him pull off some more poses (especially since, given his ankle tilts,
he's surprisingly stable for a TF with a backpack).

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Deluxe class Evac has
a rather unique vehicle mode, but overall he's only a so-so deluxe, given
his obvious extras in both modes, fairly bland color scheme, and nothing
to really make him stand out in robot mode. That said, owning a toy of
the Transformer you "rode" in on one heck of a virtual attraction is an
excellent memento of your time at
    <i>
     Transformers: The Ride
    </i>
    , and if
you go to Universal Studios and ride the TF Ride this is practically a
must. As a toy, though, it's pretty skippable, and not worth paying the
extra markup for if you haven't ridden on said ride.

      Evac is used to dodging laser fire.
His entire life, Decepticons have gotten in his way, and tried to stop
him. They've never succeeded. No matter how overwhelming their attack,
Evac knows that with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee covering him, nothing
will stop him from delivering his passengers safely.
