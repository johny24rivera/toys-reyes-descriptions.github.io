    Bumblebee's Chevrolet
Camaro vehicle mode is pretty accurately represented here on his Titan
Changer form; the proportions are pretty accurate all around, and the only
robot mode extras are the little slanted bits on his back end which become
his robot feet. Beyond that, there isn't much to complain about in this
mode design-wise. The mold detailing is also pretty accurate as well, with
both the basic and the more intricate details present. The curved grill
with the large angular bits on the sides are present, keeping this toy
accurate as far as the model of Camaro 'Bee is in the movie. He's also
got those nice triangular bits on the sides, in front of the car doors;
the several vents on the hood; and all the necessary molded-in details
on the back end, like the exhaust pipes on the lower sides, all those angles
on near the sides, and so on. Many TLK toys have paint detailing problems,
and Titan Changer Bumblebee is no exception. There IS a fair amount of
black paint used in this mode to contrast against all his yellow (specifically,
on his front grill, front hood, and windows), along with the usual black
plastic on the wheels. (Due to the transformation, a crooked "U" of yellow
pokes out from the black on the front window and hood.) There's also a
spot of metallic bronze on that all-important Chevrolet symbol on the front.
However, there's a lot of major details still unpainted in this mode, particularly
on the front grill and back end, like the headlights/taillights. Still,
you get what you pay for.

    To transform Bumblebee,
just fold his legs down from the back end, unhooking them at the sides,
and then rotate his arms out and down from the front portion of the body,
and you're done. Bumblebee is very much a "shellformer" toy in this mode,
with many of his details just molded into shell portions of the car mode.
This doesn't look all that bad for the legs honestly, as there's only the
very sides of the car that go out beyond what the mass of his legs should
be. However, his arms are absolutely awful, being way too big in the shoulders
and ridiculously tiny in the lower arms. His head is also simply molded
into the front of a panel that forms part of his front hood, and his chest
and waist are molded onto the underside of parts that form much of the
top hood. Because of the sizes of the parts these details are molded on,
Bumblebee is too skinny at the chest, and because Titan Changers are made
to be as large as possible given the budget, his proportions in general
are a bit stretched vertically, here. He's also very 2-D; he's extremely
flat from a side view, though he's still relatively stable, at least. All
of this said, the mold detailing on him IS remarkably intricate and accurate
to the show model as much as can be given the proportions. He's got the
angular, faux grill on his chest, his "gas cap pelvis", some angular and
spring details on his legs, and some wiry details on his tiny arms and
hands. Paint-wise Bumblebee especially suffers in this mode. He's got some
black on his chest and stomach, and his face is silver with light blue
eyes. That's it, and that's not nearly enough given the multitude of detailing
on him, with nearly all of it being in yellow; only the tires and small
parts on his shoulders and knees are black plastic in this mode. For articulation,
Bumblebee can move at the shoulders and forward at the knees. (You can
technically move him at two points at each knee, but one just completely
breaks the illusion of it being a solid leg and just looks extremely weird,
so it's not recommended.)

    Bumblebee is the weakest
of three TLK Titan Changers, and that's saying a lot given how incredibly
budget-minded this subline is. He does have a pretty nice car mode, albeit
one that could use a bit more paint, but MAN does his robot mode pay for
that. Wacked-out proportions everywhere, almost no paint, everything just
detailed onto a shell portion of his vehicle mode... just ugh. Get one
of the many other TLK Bumblebee toys instead, even if you have to pay a
little more.
