    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War Within
Thundercracker

     In traditional Sunstorm
tradition, War Within Sunstorm has a very sunny, light color scheme. (Granted,
there never WAS a War Within Sunstorm, but hey, it's an excuse to do another
repaint of the awesome War Within Seeker mold, I'm all for it.) The yellow
is fairly light, but not so bright that it's obnoxious, and the light orange
of course goes very well with it. All the white, while not clashing, makes
Sunstorm look rather creamsicle-ish, but he's always had white hands, so
I can hardly fault the designers for that. The black is used more on this
version of Sunstorm than on any other, and it's certainly not the dominant
color, it really helps to give a dark contrast against all those other
light colors. The black angular stripes on the shoulders and lower legs
look especially good-- Sunstorm has quite a few paint apps, but they're
different from both Thundercracker's and
     <a href="titanstarscream.html">
      Starscream's
     </a>
     ,
and it's nice to see he's not just a straight pallet swap. And hey, Sunstorm's
actually got a black head-- third time's a charm, I guess. It's a shame
the more major characters Starscream and Thundercracker got stuck with
a inaccurate gray head, however. The few bits of red also contrast very
nicely against the red and black, and the dark metallic gunmetal on the
cockpit is appropriate for a window while still being dark enough to contrast
against the brighter colors.

     War Within Sunstorm
is an excellent repaint, and definitely as good as it can be considering
the color scheme he's always had. I'm not a big fan of yellow, but even
that doesn't bug me considering it's not a bright shade and it has plenty
of contrasting colors. Recommended over Thundercracker, but not quite as
much as Starscream.

       Deep within the laboratory of the Decepticon
genius Shockwave, Sunstorm languishes in a sealed cryogenic regeneration
chamber. His body covered in rare electrum to protect him from the furious
energies boiling from his internal fusion reactors and his mind held in
stasis lock he is fierce potentiality held barely in check.

       Though Sunstorm is a clone of the famous
air warrior Starscream, Shockwave has made a number of modifications to
his systems. His weapon systems have been upgraded to take advantage of
the huge amount of energy produced by the twin tokamak reactors spinning
in his torso, each arm cannon delivering the force of a small nuke with
a single shot. His mind has been simplified, streamlined, and stripped
of the extraneous ego and ambition that so cripples Starscream. He is a
pure creature, built the way all Transformers would have been had Shockwave
been their designer. He waits, silent and still, for the stimulus that
will drive him into action.
