    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Voyager Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Voyager

2008 or Hasbrotoyshop.com, Universe 2.0 Nemesis Prime here is about what
you'd expect if you heard it was a repaint of the Classics Voyager Optimus
Prime mold. For a while now, evil Primes have tended to have the same black/gray/teal
color scheme, and this version of Nemesis Prime is no different. As before,
the metallic shade of teal looks great and is just the right shade, being
neither too dark nor too light like on some previous versions of Nemesis
Prime. He's got his fair share of paint apps with no real large parts being
unpainted except his smokestack-gun, so that's definitely a plus. The very
dark blue is a bit new, but it works well as another dark color, being
offset very nicely by the teal and the gray plastic. The silver stripes
in vehicle mode are pretty nice-looking, though with them being the same
stripes as Optimus Prime on an exclusive toy, it's not quite as impressive.
One odd thing, though, is that Nemesis Prime has transparent blue windows,
a pretty big departure from previous versions of this character where the
windows were red. (The optics are painted red in robot mode so that his
face still looks eeevil.) The transparent blue isn't necessarily bad, but
transparent red would have looked a lot better in its place and would have
made the toy look even more eeevil.

Prime is a great (if unoriginal) repaint of one of the best Classics molds,
and looks even better than the original, in my opinion. Out of all the
"cheap" versions of this mold, this is the best, though if you can spare
the money I think

     is even better-looking.

       Broken by a nightmare eternity of torture
at the hands of Straxus, Nemesis Prime does not remember what he was before
he was this. He is the culmination of a grand plan never realized by Straxus
before his destruction; a lowly warrior reconstructed to be the very image
of Optimus Prime. Imprinted with memory engrams and combat algorithms recovered
from hundreds of sources, he possesses much of the knowledge of the Autobot
leader, but without any framework by which to organize it. Despite his
incredible power, he is deeply unstable, a threat to Decepticons and Autobots
alike. He cowers in the shadows of Cybertron, living only to stalk and
destroy his fellow Transformers.
