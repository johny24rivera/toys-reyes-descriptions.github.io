    Soundwave returns from
    <a href="prisoundwave.html">
     Prime
    </a>
    , this time with a COMPLETELY different
look-- well, 95% different. We'll talk more about that later. For now,
let's focus on Soundwave's alt mode, which is a now a military truck-SUV
kinda thing. He's also rather large-looking for Warrior-class toy in this
mode, since due to his transformation so much of his interior is hollow
here. The front looks big, beefy, and armored, being very wide with large
wheel covers. On the front bumper are some details a LOT like G1 Soundwave's
tape deck details, but more stylized and angular. The wheels on Soundwave
have some neat treaded details on them, and are fairly unique, being transparent
red with a black center. Some people have said they look too "toy-ish",
but I think they look pretty cool, almost like TRON wheels. Unfortunately
Soundwave's cockpit &amp; windows are WAY too small proportionally, even
taking into account stylization. It just looks laughably small, surrounded
by so much bulk on every side. The back half has some decent side details,
with large wheel covers again above his rear wheels, but unfortunately
there's two BIG extras here-- his robot lower arms. I'm mean, they're just
THERE. The fists don't even flip in to hide or anything. They stick out
and are so blatant they almost ruin the mode, quite frankly. The back middle
portion is formed from Soundwave's robot legs, which is good enough except
for the fact there's a noticeable gap in between them for some of the top.
There isn't really a back end, it mostly just being Soundwave's folded-down
feet, which have some vent-like details molded into them but nothing that
looks like any kind of exhaust port. It has a turret (which resembles G1
Soundwave's shoulder cannon in a totally-not-coincidence) and you can plug
the turret into four different points; either just to the right or left
of the cockpit, or a bit more to the back and right/left of the cockpit,
on one of the holes sticking out of his arms. The turret can rotate in
place, or look "up" or "down" a little as well. For mold detailing, Soundwave
has some ridges on the top, as well as some small headlights on the size
and the aforementioned treaded details on his wheels, but other than that
and some stylized bits on the parts that become his robot lower arms and
legs he's surprisingly bereft of mold detailing, even for a RID2015 toy.
I think he needed some more detailing here, given what kind of vehicle
he is. Given this toy's more G1-centric vibe, Soundwave is now mostly a
dark, dull blue. There's a fair amount of dark dull milky gray here, which
is dark enough where it doesn't look bland, but also isn't light enough
to really contrast against the dark blue much. The transparent red used
on the wheels and cockpit windows is a nice shade, though again, it could
stand to be a few shades lighter for better contrast. There's a little
black on his wheel hubs and the front bumper, and just a titch of a really
nice shade of metallic purple on his headlights-- I really wish such a
nice color was used elsewhere on him. There's also some rather plain red
on the middle of his lower arms, and some dull yellow surrounding his black
bumper details. The yellow, despite being dull, pops quite a bit against
both the black and the dark blue, so I quite like it. Finally, there's
a metallic shade of dark blue used for his turret and some details on the
pieces that become his lower legs in this mode-- it's a really nice shade,
but is one of those "different but not different ENOUGH" shades when compared
to his dark blue plastic. Like, why do just some parts look metallic when
so much of him doesn't? They stick out a bit because of this.

    For his transformation,
in general terms Soundwave's back section folds down, separates, and turns
around to form his legs; the sides fold forward and fragment apart to become
his arms and shoulders; and his head flips up and then his cockpit accordions
in behind his front bumper to form his chest. Then you add his turret to
either side of his head, and you're done. It's slightly more complicated
than most RID2015 warriors, but still not what I would call complex. Anyways,
the end result is definitely a very buff, stylized Soundwave, though some
remnants of his Prime version still exist. The most obvious is his head,
which is basically unchanged from Prime-- and it looks WEIRD on this toy,
having such a slim, faceless head on such a bulky body. They really should
have updated that a bit. He also has a few pointy bits that hearken back
to his Prime version, like the points on his shoulders and kneecaps. Otherwise
it's mostly a stylized G1 Soundwave design with a vehicle alt mode. He's
got the familiar "cassette deck" stylized details on his chest, though
sadly it cannot open nor does he have Laserbeak. His front wheels make
for nice, bulky shoulders, with some covers on the side and front so they
don't look like JUST wheels. Of course, his arms you've already seen thanks
to his vehicle mode, though now they actually fit with the mode. The finger-claws
are a nice "in-between" when comparing Prime Soundwave's hands to G1 Soundwave's
hands. There are small panels that hang off the upper shoulders and lower
arms that I would consider kibble, but they generally stay out of the way
and are minor downsides. His legs are pretty straightforward, with a fairly
tight waist and bulky lower legs, with the rear wheels giving him some
nice stability by giving him some more bulk down there. Because so much
of this is visible in vehicle mode, there isn't much new detailing here,
minus the Soundwave head which again, is a dead ringer for Prime Soundwave's
head in every aspect aside from color (and yes, he does have wonderful
light piping because of his face design). He has some basic detailing on
his upper legs, with some very tiny detailing on his waist that mimics
the "tape player buttons" on his G1 version. Other than that, you've seen
everything here. The addition of more dark gray on the appendages does
help break up the colors a bit more than in vehicle mode, however. (I don't
like that the vents are painted gray on the sides of his head, though--
it looks off for some reason.) He's quite articulated, and can move at
the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows, rotation at the abs (which
given his bulging upper chest basically looks like waist rotation), and
movement at the hips (at two points) and knees. His ankles can also move
back-and-forth, but only slightly.

    RID2015 warrior Soundwave
has the best robot mode of his various toys of this design, being quite
articulated and proportionate with few downsides. However, his vehicle
mode is honestly kinda bad once you get past the front section, with a
tiny cockpit and a back end just made up of fairly obvious robot bits.
The lack of any sort of Laserbeak or chest-opening is also a downside.
If the robot mode and articulation are mostly what you care about, this
is the version for you, but in terms of a good "balance" between modes
and playability, I'd recommend the Activator version more.
