    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Turbo
Tracks. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     "Over-Run" is actually
a direct update to G1 Runabout, so named differently because of copyright
issues. Appropriately, he uses the same base mold as his fellow Battlecharger
exclusive
     <a href="bcrunamuck.html">
      Runamuck
     </a>
     (though you have to pay
     <i>
      in
addition to
     </i>
     membership to get this guy; a bit of business savvy, there).
Just like his G1 self, Over-Run/Runabout's main colors are black and light
gray, with a pretty good amount of red in there too so he's not so monochrome.
The black is a particularly nice shade of the color, having enough glittery
stuff in the mix where it looks like the finish to a "real" black car,
as opposed to simply flat black plastic. The light gray is blah and boring,
but at least it's only visible in robot mode. The red, now-- it's a plain
shade of red, but it goes DARNED well with the black and other various
paint accents on Over-Run (such as the white rims and silver headlights).
I know, I know, black and red is hardly an original color scheme by this
point, but it looks so great I'm certainly not complaining. The two stripes
down the middle of the car mode and the bits on the front bumper look particularly
good. Over-Run's transparent plastic is a really evil-looking shade of
red to boot, though it does clash with the noticeably lighter red paint
used on his rear window details. Over-Run has a G1-style allegiance "rub"
symbol in the middle of his roof.

     As with Runamuck, Over-Run
has all the mold changes made to this mold for
     <a href="genwheeljack.html">
      Generations
Wheeljack
     </a>
     , along with a headsculpt he and Runamuck share. It's a pretty
good headsculpt and is faithful to the original toy design while updating
it a bit with more details. It's a bit skinny from a sideview, but that's
the only real complaint I have against it.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     TFCC Over-Run gives
this great mold the best color scheme it has in the "Wheeljack configuration",
with some really dynamic red stripes down the vehicle mode, a really nice
shade of black, and it just generally screams "bad guy". Recommended if
you're in the market for high-dollar exclusives.

       Over-Run tries to pass himself off as
a suave connoisseur of fine things. It's not a facade he can really maintain
for long, less because of his generally low intelligence and more because
his interest in beautiful objects starts and ends with "blow them up!"
His drive to seem sophisticated is in direct conflict with his enthusiastic
love of explosions and action. The former is almost always on the losing
side of that battle. He's not interested in the Decepticon plan for conquest;
he's just with them because of the greater opportunities for his kind of
fun. He's always on the move, looking to create a bigger fireball, a larger
bomb crater, and generally cram every microsecond with action!
