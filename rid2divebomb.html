    Divebomb's torpedo mode
is... well, a torpedo-shaped collapsed-in robot. I know that these are
simple toys and some aspects of the robot mode are always going to be visible
or obvious in these simple alt modes, but nearly everything except the
head from robot mode is obvious. The front sections of the torpedo-- due
to the way the legs connect together-- is pretty obviously the lower legs
and toes of the robot mode, while the side sections of this mode are obviously
the robot arms, especially since the fists are right there. Because of
the coloration, the outline of the main body is also quite obvious in the
middle-back of this mode, made even more obvious because of little gaps
in between this section of the torpedo and the front and side sections.
(From a more side-on view this isn't obvious, but from a top-down view
it's REALLY obvious.) The colors on Divebomb are a fairly medium, milky
purple, along with fuchsia that has a bit of glitter in it so it has a
nice semi-metallic shade to it. These are both certainly Decepticon-y colors,
and they both contrast and complement each other quite well. Unfortunately,
that's it as far as colors in this mode, and there's no paint visible at
all. I do like the rather angular mold detailing, though, particularly
on the front section, though there's plenty of spiky bits near the back.
There's also some pistons and mechanical details on the arms and body,
and they look pretty good and intricate, especially by RID2015 standards.

    To transform Divebomb
to robot mode, you just push his legs apart and the rest auto-transforms
(except for the feet, which you have to flip out manually). Given that
so much of his robot mode is obvious in torpedo mode, this mode ends up
being largely the same in its look, just a bit more "spread-out". I do
love the angled-out hands, like he's ready to pounce, but his upper legs
are molded at such a weird angle it makes it look like he's broken his
legs with such a wide-angled stance. The head is visible in this mode,
which-- like much of Divebomb-- has large angular crests on the head, along
with a relatively tiny face with the only paint on this toy-- he's got
a silver face, with fuchsia/red eyes and an evil little confident smirk.
He's got some nice triangular claws molded onto his hands, too, so he looks
like he could cut you. The fuchsia bits behind his head are a little bit
of an eyesore, though, as they don't really serve much of a purpose and
make him look unnecessarily hunch-backed when I don't think he's meant
to be to that extent. Like most other Mini-Cons, unfortunately Divebomb
can't move at all in this mode-- the pose above is it. Divebomb's armor
bits are transparent green, which is a pretty nice shade and contrasts
against Divebomb's darker colors EXTREMELY well. Most of these armor bits
add even more spiky bits to Divebomb, with chest armor (along with a connected
fold-down mask piece) and spiky knee pieces, as well as large scythe-like
pieces that peg behind his lower arms and guns that can fit in each of
his fist holes (I wish he could point them forward...). All in all, they
definitely make Divebomb look more eeevil and are a great addition, like
most Mini-Con armor. (All armor pieces can fit on Divebomb in torpedo mode.)

    Divebomb is pretty average
for a Mini-Con. My main issue with him is he doesn't make for a very convincing
torpedo-- nearly all of his parts are just visible right there, just in
a torpedo-ish shape. In robot mode there's a couple of extra bits behind
his head and his legs are at an odd angle, but otherwise it's quite good,
his armor pieces really add a lot to his robot mode, and his color scheme
is fairly good. He's one of the few torpedo Mini-Cons actually on the show,
so if you want a toy of him and like the gimmick this is an easy buy for
such a cheap price, but temper your expectations.
