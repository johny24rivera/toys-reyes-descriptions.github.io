    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE Stomp
'n Chomp Grimlock toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Well, this is something
I didn't expect. Well, I DID expect it but for TF5-- not RID2015! The largest
toy from
     <a href="tfaoetoys.html">
      Age of Extinction
     </a>
     has been redecoed
with RID2015 Grimlock colors. I kinda refuse to say it's been redecoed
"INTO" RID2015 Grimlock because... c'mon, other than the general idea of
a t-rex becoming a robot and the color scheme, what else does he have in
common with RID2015 Grimlock? As far as obvious visual stuff, there's been
ZERO remolding to the toy-- no new head in either mode, no new chest, nothing
that would've been relatively easy to do to make him look "close enough"
to RID2015 Grimlock and give him the general feel of the character. However,
that SAID.... RID2015 Grimlock's colors DO look good on this toy. The major
colors of black and dark green are spread out pretty well, and the dark
green in particular looks quite nice. The plastic version of dark green
is swirly and semi-metallic, with the dark green paint (used mostly on
the legs and the outer half of the upper arms) outright metallic and looking
REALLY nice there. There's unfortunately some fairly light milky gray used
on the toy as well, which is pretty bland, but it's thankfully not used
a whole lot-- just on the underside of the upper jaw and on the deployable
weapons in alt mode. There's a good amount of silver paint used-- on most
of the top of the t-rex head, the teeth, the t-rex arms, and a bit on the
abs. The face has been painted with a dull mustard yellow-- a duller version
of the gold color used on RID2015 Grimlock's face, but the duller color
fits AoE Grimlock's headsculpt. The transparent plastic is just a straightforward
cloudy clear plastic-- the electronic lights and sounds on this Grimlock
are the exact same as on the AoE version, which again, with the exception
of perhaps some roars, does NOT fit RID2015 Grimlock at all. Worst of all,
they've gotten rid of his sword! Now this huge expensive toy has no robot
mode weapon, and that's a real shame, especially at $10 more expensive
than the previous version (at least initially). The AoE Optimus mini-figure
has also been removed, though that one makes sense honestly. The only part
of Grimlock that really could use some more paint is his waist, which is
entirely black and could've used some more silver or dark green.

     Although there are no
OBVIOUS mold changes to RID2015 Stomp 'n Chomp Grimlock, the gimmick in
t-rex mode of having the mini Optimus figure (or other 1-steps and Power
Battlers) use the magnetic pin on its foot to activate Decepticon or Autobot
weapons has been re-done. With no figure and no gimmick in the line with
magnetic pins in their feet, instead there's now just a straightforward
little button in the same areas that activates the "Autobot" and "Decepticon"
weapons. (The allegiance symbols are still there, but aren't painted to
de-emphasize any faction-switching.) The same sound effects and whatnot
still occur when this gimmick is activated. No other mold changes have
been made to the toy.

     It's difficult to think
of a bigger waste of shelf space and plastic than RID2015 Stomp 'n Chomp
Grimlock. A huge toy priced outside of most kids' range, $10 more expensive
than the previous version, with a mini-figure and the sword gone, and painted
up to match a character the toy does NOT otherwise look like AT ALL. The
color scheme is pretty nice, especially with the metallic dark green, but
that's about it. Only recommended for Grimlock/movie completists, and even
then you should probably get it on DEEP discount.
