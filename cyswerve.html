    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Clocker. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Clocker

     Swerve, like the other
recent toys that have the same name, is a throwback to his G1 self, at
least in terms of the color scheme (G1 Swerve was a 4WD vehicle, not a
sportscar). The red, black, and silver looks better on this version of
Swerve than the other recent color schemes, and is all balanced very well,
with the just the right amount of white and silver to offset the black
and red. In fact, this is one of the few instances where I think the charcoal
"almost black, but a bit more dirtier looking" color works better in the
overall scheme than a solid black would have. I'm not too fond of the big
Autobot symbol on the front hood, though-- it looks overly tacky, and considering
that Swerve is a bit of an anti-hero according to his bio, proudly proclaiming
his allegiance to the Autobots by slapping a big ol' insignia of theirs
on his hood doesn't seem like something he'd do. And, although the paint
apps are adequate enough in number for the mold, considering that many
of the parts didn't have to be mostly painted-over like they were on Clocker,
I would have liked to see those paint apps used somewhere else on Swerve.

     Cybertron Swerve is
a great repaint, and a nice subtle nod to the G1 version. I don't like
the big Autobot symbol on his hood, but everything else about his color
scheme and paint app placement looks very nice to me. Recommended over
Clocker.

       Impatient and short-tempered, Swerve
is a robot whose processors run so hot he was forced to install a backup
exhaust system just to compensate for the excess heat. After his suspension
from official races for poor sportsmanship, he found himself in the seedy
underground oil-sport racing circuit. There, running races which the last
robot standing is declared victor, he's finally found an outlet for his
temper, and a use for his lightning fast reflexes and sharp-shooting skills.
