    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Legends of
Cybertron Hot Shot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Legends of Cybertron Hot Shot

      For some odd reason,
even though this Hot Shot redeco is clearly the Excellion redeco of the
mold from the main Cybertron line, it's still called Hot Shot. Huh. Well,
that aside, Excellion was an awesome redeco of Hot Shot, and this is almost
as great of a redeco. The gold paint flames on the front go very, very
nice with the red, and the orange color, which is more visible in robot
mode, also goes great with all the other colors. Heck, all of the colors
go very well with each other, so no complaints whatsoever when it comes
to this repaint. There are a few details on the larger Excellion toy that
are noticeably absent from this toy, however-- namely the gold flames on
the rear part of the vehicle mode and the silver paint apps on the robot
shoulders. There's also a couple of minor color inconsistencies between
the two figures, as this toy's rear wings are orange while the larger Excellion's
are transparent blue. Neither really looks better than the other, though,
so that's not really any big deal. The black paint deco pattern on this
toy's chest also doesn't match the larger Excellion's at all, though personally
I think just a solid black looks better on the chest than the characoal
gray of the larger Excellion.

      No mold changes have
been made to LoC Hot Shot/Excellion.

      The LoC Hot Shot "Excellion"
redeco is an improvement over the original LoC toy in every way when it
comes to the color scheme, just like the larger Excellion when compared
to the larger Hot Shot. It's too bad that the mold design didn't translate
too well to LoC size, otherwise I'd wholeheartedly recommend it.
