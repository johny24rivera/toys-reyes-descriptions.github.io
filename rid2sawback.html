    Sawback's alt mode is
a disc, made to work with the
    <a href="rid2deployerdrift.html">

    </a>
    mold. It's one of the best disc modes out of all the Autobot
Mini-Cons with this alt-mode-- the dog feet are rather obvious on the bottom,
but other than that it's solid all the way around, on both sides. You've
got little "blades" coming out of the edges, and armor plating details
throughout the toy (including even something that looks like Drift's head
crest). It's just 90% pure awesome, as far as the proportions and mold
details. Unforutnately, there is NO paint in this mode. None, at all, which
is really a shame with those details. His main color by far is a nice shade
of dark milky blue, which is cool by itself but with no paint, it's such
a dark color you can't make out many of the details easily. Beyond the
blue there's just a little bit of the white gears used for transformation
visible on the sides, which provides at least a little much-needed contrast,
but that's it, unfortunately.

    To transform Sawback
to his beast mode, you just pull back on the top section of the disc and
the rest automatically unfolds, while said top section becomes his tail.
In beast mode Sawback's an Akita-like dog, which fits given Drift's Japanese
theme. Using that part of the disc for a big fluffy tail was a brilliant
idea; it really helps to give Sawback character. The head piece has a rather
fierce expression, with Sawback snarling a bit-- and here is where the
only paint is on the entire toy, with a white muzzle and pale yellow eyes.
I honestly think reversing the colors might've worked better for this mode--
making him mostly white with a bit of blue. Still, it's a pretty good color
scheme overall, just-- again-- not nearly enough paint. The upside of having
obvious legs in disc mode is that they make pretty good legs in this mode,
if a bit undersized. The weakest portion of this mode is the body, as from
a somewhat top-down view you can see the gears and the hollowness inside
the mode, which is partially a side effect of having the entire top rotate
off to become the tail for the transformation. The body is also a touch
too long in the front, but not by much-- if you're going to poo-poo the
proportions in this mode you should look at it from a front view, which
is a bit too 2-D because of the fact that he transforms into a disc. Unfortunately,
as with pretty much all RID2015 Mini-Cons, Sawback has no articulation--
it's this pose or nothing. If you try to rotate any of his moveable parts,
he'll start to curl back up into disc mode. For his transparent armor bits,
Sawback gains an extra "flame-like" spike coming off of his tail, a "mask"
around the top portion of his face, two daggers on his shoulders, and two
guns on the sides behind his front legs. They're a transparent amber, which
looks pretty decent against the dark blue, though admittedly I have seen
better transparent colors. As usual the armor bits add a lot to this mode,
making Sawback look considerably more fierce and with quite an arsenal
on his front end. The side guns look a bit too obviously like animal legs
(given that they DO become animal legs if you get all the Wave 1 Mini-Cons
to form the special "secret" figure), but otherwise the mold detailing
and proportions on these pieces are solid. Unfortunately the mask piece
cannot fit on anywhere if you transform Sawback back to disc mode, but
all the other pieces can stay on.

    Sawback is one of the
best disc Mini-Cons, with an incredibly solid disc mode (with only tiny
feet showing) and a pretty good Akita dog mode as well. I love the big
fluffy tail made out of part of the disc, and having this kind of dog being
the main mode is pretty unique among Transformers, to boot. His armor bits
are, as is almost always the case with Mini-Cons, a nice touch, but it's
a darn shame the mask can't fit into the disc mode. If you keep in mind
the inherent weaknesses of the size class/gimmick and want more Mini-Cons
for Drift, it's hard to recommend a non-show character more then Sawback.
