    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Ironhide toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Voyager Ironhide toy

     Like most of the other
Movie Premium toys, Premium Ironhide's overall color scheme remains pretty
much unchanged-- black is still easily his dominant color. However, what
sets Premium Ironhide apart from his initial release is the INSANE amount
of paint apps added to him this time around. Any complaints I had about
Ironhide having too much black on him? GONE now. In both modes, but particularly
in robot mode, Premium Ironhide is covered in nifty paint apps that really
contrast incredibly well with the black. He's got dark metallic silvery
blue paint out the wazoo now, and it really looks nice-- his legs are especially
thick with the color, but his arm cannons are actually painted that color
now, making them look metallic, unlike the solid plastic light blue cannons
of the original toy. He's also got several more bronze paint apps, and
considerably more silver, too-- especially in vehicle mode, where the roof
has silver stripes and the front hood has an Autobot symbol on it. (The
last paint app I'm actually not all that fond of, however, seeing as how
it's not at all movie-accurate, which is sort of the point of these Premium
redecoes.) The windows have also had a silver "frost" pattern sprayed over
the top of them, so Ironhide's robot parts aren't nearly as visible in
truck mode. A few new accent colors have also been added to the mix, like
the dark blue rooflights and the light blue optics and headlights, which
all look very nice.

     Premium Ironhide is
precisely what all the Premium toys should be-- like his original version,
but with tons of more (and more movie-accurate) paint applications. All
these paint apps totally break up all that black. Recommended about on
par with

     , and definitely
over the original release.

       With the war finally over, Ironhide
is free to return to the simple, easy life he knew before. Captain Lennox
has been kind enough to lend him some space in his barn to store the crates
containing his weapon collection, and S7 has been more than happy to indulge
him in experimental weaponry. Lennox and Ironhide spend their weekends
in the most remote places they can get to, blasting boulders and small
hills into atoms, and trading war stories. He watches over Lennox's family
while the human soldier is away on duty, and in return, Lennox keeps the
old Autobot warrior in perfect condition.
