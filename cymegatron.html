    This time around, Megatron's
main vehicle mode is a highly futuristic car of some sort. It looks like
some tricked-out version of the Batmobile, actually. The designers really
went all-out to make this car look really evil-- it's angular and pointed
crests everywhere, especially above the front wheels and in front of the
rear wheels, give it an armored carapace-like look. There's also angular
wings and engines on the backpart, as well as a somewhat streamlined look
to the whole vehicle to make it look fast, too. To help out with that,
Megatron's Key Gimmick in this mode, when activated, makes the two rear
thrusters spread out a little bit, and an odd "gurgling-- accelerating"
noise is made. Yeah, that's the best description I can give it. Rather
lame, but it's not Megatron's only Key Gimmick, so it's not that big of
a deal. His actual key, unique since he's the leader, looks pretty cool--
it's angular, and shaped almost like a scowling Decepticon logo-face. Eeeeevil.
Another neat detail Megatron sports in this mode is a transparent cockpit
with a drivers' seat inside. One thing I really don't like about this mode
is that the plates that make up the front of Megatron's legs in robot mode
just kinda hang off the back end, not really going anywhere or looking
like anything. And since they're in a slight curved position in this mode,
I'm afraid they may warp overtime since they're made of that soft bendy
plastic. My main complaint though, would have to be Megatron's puke-tastic
color scheme. The gray, purple, and black go together alright,k but the
orange and green-- ugh, what were they thinking? It's like they just threw
random colors of paint at Megatron and then kept it that way. The orange
and green completely clash with Megatron's other colors, and just really
look bad. Megatron also has two firing missile launches in between those
two rear thrusters, though mine are REALLY sensitive, to the point where
it's hard to even keep the missiles in them-- a pretty annoying downside,
to say the least.

    Megatron is officially
a triple-changer, and his third mode is a "jet". Which only involves taking
the front wheel-crests of his car mode and swinging them to his sides,
thus making his front part a bit slimmer and giving him teeny tiiiny wings
on the sides. He looks about as close to a jet as I do to a Twinkie. Still,
it is a third mode, so I guess I should consider it more of a bonus than
anything. But it's hardly worth the minimal time and effort taken to "transform"
Megatron into this crummy sub-mode.

    The story behind Megatron's
robot mode is that he used some of Unicron's armor to strengthen himself,
and the
    <a href="unicron.html">
     Unicron
    </a>
    influence on the robot mode
shows. First, the arms are nearly identical to Unicron's arms, minus some
color differences and the purple shell-like things on the back of the forearms.
He also has "wings" like Unicron, made up of the front sides of his car
mode. He also has little demonic-like horns on his face, too-- however,
they're pointed at an odd forward angle, and it makes his head look...
well, a little goofy, really. If they were flat vertical crests on his
forehead it would have worked much better. His wings also get in the way
of arm movement a little, though is overall articulation is excellent--
he can move at any place you could reasonably expect on such a figure,
except side-to-side articulation at the elbows. His proportions are also
spot-on, and he's got lots of cool mold and paint detailing all over his
baaad self, though the colors still clash like nobody's business. He is
a little back-heavy, though, and his ankle joints are a little on the loose
side, so this limits his posability somewhat. Megatron has two key gimmicks
in this mode, one on each of his "wings" that unlock a weapon for him to
hold. When used on his right wing, the key unlocks a little rotary wheel-gun,
which can be rotated by a little crank on the top of the weapon. Kinda
wished it fired a missile though, since without a missile it looks like
Megatron is carrying an EGGBEATER OF DOOOM! When the key is used on the
left wing, it unlocks a weird... thing... that has three little spikes
on it that move up or down if you move the weapon back in forth in his
hand. Yeah, I have no idea what it could be used for, either.

    Megatron has a very
cool vehicle mode and a pretty nice robot mode, but his colors REALLY clash,
and a few things, such as his Key Gimmicks and "jet mode" are pretty lame.
It's still a rather good mold, but unless you're a completist, I'd wait
for the Galvatron repaint coming later on down the line-- the colors on
that one look MUCH better.

      For millions of years, Megatron has
led fanatical legions of evil Decepticons on their war for conquest of
the Universe. A living weapon with dozens of self-inflicted modifications
made in the name of increased power and destructive capability, his only
weakness is his single-minded desire for the enslavement of the Universe.
His intellect, ego and talent for deception are second to none, and he
rules his Decepticons with an iron-fisted combination of fear and force
of personality. Driven by a nearly insane lust for power, Megatron managed
not only to survive the catastrophic implosion of Unicron, but also to
absorb much of his power. Now, wearing salvaged pieces of the ancient destroyer's
armor, Megatron is awesomely powerful, and is determined to beat Optimus
Prime and the Autobots to the lost Planet Keys.
