    Soundwave's satellite
alternate mode (this toy's no triple changer) is honestly pretty bad. Granted,
Soundwave's
    <i>
     design
    </i>
    calls for a rather unconvincing satellite mode,
but this is just poor. The main body is decent enough, forming the core
satellite cylinder, and the back wings are pretty good-- but this mode
tends to fall apart on just about anything other than that. Soundwave's
satellite "head" is molded unusually badly in comparison to how well-done
the rest of his molding is, and it's all painted one odd aquamarine color
that is completely out-of-place on the toy. It looks more like something
you'd expect on a Happy Meal toy than an actual retail release, truth be
told. Out of the three front "fins", two of them are a bit too obviously
his robot mode legs, though the third doesn't look bad. However, by far
the biggest eyesore in this mode is that Soundwave's entire robot mode
head &amp; chest assemblage just hang upside-down behind the main body
of the satellite, just... THERE. No real attempt to hide them at all, and
it just looks awful. Not even remotely like another panel "wing" of the
satellite mode. Just... ugh.

    Soundwave's robot mode
is definitely where the design priority went, as it looks much, MUCH better
than the satellite mode. In fact, it's a darned good mode for a Legends
class figure. The proportions are great (even if the chest is a tad too
square), and he's got great mold detailing everywhere with some great paint
apps on his main body. The added bits of dark blue and dull gold really
add to the otherwise fairly dull black-and-gray color scheme without looking
out-of-place like Soundwave's aquamarine satellite mode head. He's also
got great articulation for a figure of this size-- he can move at the neck,
shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and a little at the ankles, too, so every
major point is covered except for the waist (which is almost never moveable
on a figure this small). In fact, I think this mode is actually BETTER
than the
    <a href="rotfsoundwave.html">
     deluxe's
    </a>
    in a few ways-- namely
the way it deals with extras. The satellite "wings" just hang off Soundwave's
shoulders like bird wings, and anything else folds up neatly against his
back of becomes an appendage. Honestly, considering the scale, I don't
really have any major complaints about this mode.

    RotF Legends class Soundwave
has a great robot mode, but his satellite mode is so incredibly poor odd-looking
I'd easily recommend the deluxe mold over this one-- even if on a few areas
like kibble in robot mode, this one actually slightly beats the larger
version.
