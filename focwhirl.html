    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Vortex.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations FoC Vortex

     Like the other Wreckers
in the Ruination gestalt, FoC Whirl's colors are a bit of a mishmash of
previous influences. His G1 light blue scheme obviously plays a factor,
though there's some dark blue and orange in there to give him some color-coordination
to the RiD Ruination gestalt member
     <a href="rotor.html">
      Ro-Tor

     . A
bit odd of a pull from different sources, but the colors themselves go
together marvelously. The dark blue is quite an attractive shade, and the
orange contrasts with it extremely well, while avoiding being so prominent
as to throw off the general "darkness" of his main colors. The light sky
blue paint on his swords, windows, eye, and bits of his chest and back
end fit with the FoC "Energon conduit" look quite well, and complement
and contrast against the dark blue nicely, too. There's also a bit of dark
brownish gray used on a few of Whirl's robot bits and his main weapon--
I'm not too fond of this color as it's pretty plain, but at least it doesn't
detract much from the other colors.

     First off, the obvious
remold-- Whirl has a new head. It's not as long as his head is typically
depicted due to alt mode space restrictions, but the mono-eye look definitely
makes it unique, and the sculpting and paint on it are nicely done. Also,
beyond this mold's swords, this version ALSO comes with a gi-normous (proportionally)
rotary gun weapon. If you press forward on the light gray lever, the five
barrels pop out of the front, spinning quite rapidly for a second or two--
and then you can push the lever back to retract the spinning piece for
another go. It's a pretty neat weapon, if a bit big for the toy it comes
with, and it has several 5mm ports to plug in other weapons, so Whirl can
indeed hold all three of his weapons at once-- another nice little feature.

     Despite the fact that
I think the general robot mode structure doesn't fit G1 Whirl's traditionally
somewhat odd proportions, FoC Whirl has some nice remolding in terms of
his face and a great new weapon accessory. Add in that his color scheme
looks great all around (no matter where it came from), and this is my favorite
deco job this mold has gotten, so if you at all like the FoC Combaticon
molds, this is a definite pickup.

       No one has ever seen a helicopter pull
the stunts that Autobot Whirl makes look simple. He twists easily through
the air, nearly matching the speed and maneuverability of the numerous
Decepticon jets. His flashy behavior makes him a target on the battlefield,
but taking fire is all part of the job. If the Decepticons are focused
on him, after all, they won't see his teammates closing in.
