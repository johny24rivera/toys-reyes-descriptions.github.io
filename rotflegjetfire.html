    Jetfire's SR-71 Blackbird
mode is a bit off in some respects, but overall it looks surprisingly sleek
for a Legends class figure. The lone nosecone is done quite well, as is
the main body. The engine-wings are a bit off, though, as they suffer a
bit from becoming Jetfire's legs in robot mode- the feet stick out rather
blatantly from the back end. Jetfire's arms also stick out a bit from underneath
the nosecone, though at least they're skinny so they don't add TOO much
bulk.Â  His robot head just sticks out from the back end with no attempt
to hide it-- I mean, it's just THERE. Looks kinda odd, especially since
it's upside down. Jetfire has quite an impressive amount of molded detailing
in this mode, with little panel lines and the line everywhere. Most of
the appropriate SR-71 Blackbird detailing-- namely the red lines-- is present
on the figure, though perhaps a few military-esque marking paint apps would
have helped to break up the otherwise pretty dull gray and black color
scheme.

    Jetfire's robot mode
has parts about it that are pretty good and parts about it that are kinda
lame. The "pretty good" wins out overall, though-- the legs are done REALLY
nicely, both when it comes to proportions and articulation, the head sculpt
is great (though the blue paint on the top of it is VERY hard to see against
the black), and the way his wings come together to form his torso is pretty
ingenious, especially at this size scale-- and it looks surprisingly goodl.
Jetfire's arms are ridiculously skinny, though, and the major blot on this
mode. (I do like that his left arm is molded carrying his "cane", though.)
The nosecone of the Blackbird mode also just hangs down behind his back,
and looks kinda odd. As far as articulation goes, Jetfire can move at the
shoulders (at two points), the hips (at two points), the knees, and the
ankles. Nothing spectacular, but nothing bad for a Legends figure, either.

    Legends Jetfire is by
no means perfect-- he's got some really wimpy arms in robot mode and some
undercarriage problems and feet for engines in vehicle mode-- but honestly,
if you're gonna get one version of RotF Jetfire, make it this one, even
though by far it's the smallest and cheapest. The others just suffer way
too much in at least one mode and have some problems that dwarf Legends
Jetfire's.
