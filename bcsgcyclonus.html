    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Cyclonus w/
Nightstick. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe
2.0 Cyclonus w/ Nightstick

     For his Shattered Glass
version, Cyclonus takes the colors of the Autobot he would often face in
the G1 cartoon, Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime. A stark contrast from the purple
of Universe 2.0 Cyclonus, Shattered Glass Cyclonus has light orange and
red. Unfortunately... that's really it. It's Cyclonus in orange and red.
In fact, the secondary color, dull greyish tan, is the exact same shade
(and in many of the same spots) as on the mass-release Universe 2.0 Cyclonus.
There's also no real flame paint apps or anything to make him more "Hot-Roddy",
though some of the paint apps look good, such as the light orange and black
on his chest. Due to the plastic color makeup on the mold, the top half
of his upper legs are painted orange (with the inner thighs left dull greyish
tan) while the bottom halves are molded orange plastic, and that honestly
clashes a little. The transparent plastic is now appropriately blue instead
of red so he has the "calmer" blue optics in robot mode.

     There's not much to
Shattered Glass Cyclonus w/ Krunix. Basically all they did was replace
the original's purple with orange and red. Adding some flame paint apps,
some silver instead of the same dull greyish tan-- something to really
make him stand out would've helped. As a mass-release repaint he really
wouldn't have been that bad, but as an expensive Club exclusive he seems
honestly kind of lazy and done in a rush. It's a good color scheme and
a good mold, but for the price you're better off with almost any other
Club exclusive.

       Idling in a prison cell is often the
most profound way to chase an epiphany, and Cyclonus cornered his during
his fourth deca-cycle of incarceration. Without the constant whispering
into his audio receptors by the powers that be, the remorseful Decepticon
finally found the still calm that allowed him to rise above the ever-present
chatter and hear for the first time his true voice. Now, with a determination
of his own and the moral consult from his Targetmaster partner Krunix,
he seeks to redeem his name amongst the Decepticons, all the while endeavoring
to never again lose his voice in the din of deceit and corruption he has
re-avowed to fight.
