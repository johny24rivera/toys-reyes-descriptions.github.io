    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RotF Autobot Springer.

     Duststorm's color scheme
certainly lives up to its name, being right at home (for the most part)
in the desert. The light pale tan is pretty much the exact color of sand,
and makes for a fine main color. The light milky gray is, unfortunately,
the same rather boring shade that's used on far too many TFs, and that's
the case here-- it doesn't outright clash with the other colors, but it's
simply boring and a much more interesting color could have been used in
its place. The other main color on Duststorm is a rather interesting one--
a pale (but dark) shade of purple. Although I think a more "pure" shade
of the color would have helped the contrast against the tan more, it still
looks quite good against the other colors and makes Duststorm look considerably
more unique than he otherwise would have. Most of the purple "disappears"
in robot mode, but a couple of paint apps-- like the silver and dark red
on the face, as well as the gold on the shoulders--still pop against the
tan quite well. (The head, in particular, is very well-painted.)

     Duststorm has a fitting
color scheme-- not only because of his name, but also given the place a
lot of Revenge of the Fallen takes place in-- and the addition of purple
and a few other minor accent colors help keep his color scheme unique and
a bit eye-catching. I don't think he's quite as good as the original use
of this mold as Springer, but I think it looks better than its prior use
as
