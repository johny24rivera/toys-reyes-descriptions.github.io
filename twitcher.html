    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to High Score 100. For a review

     OMG! MASTER CHIEF! Although
not officially confirmed by Hasbro (and I doubt it ever will be, given
the legal issues with that), Twitcher F451 is most definitely an homage
to the character Master Chief from the Halo video game series. The color
scheme is practically identical, and the head sculpt, while certainly not
close enough to provoke a lawsuit by Microsoft, does have some "Master
Chief-ish" qualities to it, such as the visor and faceplate design. Twitcher
is also an homage to another Xbox 360 product, namely the "Halo 3" special
edition Xbox 360 controller itself, which is very similar in colors to
Twitcher here. Homages aside, though, the color scheme itself measures
up very well. You wouldn't think that three different shades of green would
make for an interesting color scheme, but they surprisingly do. I think
it's the light green, which provides most of the contrast, that gives the
colors the zing. The black also helps a lot in terms of providing a really
dark color, as well. And the gold accents in robot mode look excellent
against the green, and really help to diversify the colors a bit more.

     Twitcher F451 is not
only a nice homage to Halo and Master Chief, but a great toy by itself
with a very interesting, eye-catching color scheme that, to me at least,
is head-and-shoulders above High Score's. My most recommended out of all
the Real Gear toys.

       Twitcher F451 is a psychological profiler,
specializing in anything that makes the Autobots uncomfortable, angry,
or afraid. With only a few minutes of observation, he can draw highly specific
conclusions about almost any target's greatest mental weaknesses, and come
up with a way to exploit them. He takes a great deal of pleasure in making
other robots uncomfortable, so even other Decepticons tend to avoid him.
