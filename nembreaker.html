    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Leobreaker. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Leobreaker

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     In the grand ol' tradition
of "evil Primes" of the past few series, Nemesis Breaker takes the general
"evil Nemesis" Prime color scheme and applies it to the Leobreaker mold,
given that Nemesis Breaker is an evil clone of the lion Autobot. In fact,
color-for-color, the color scheme is the exact same on this toy as it is
on
     <a href="superscourge.html">
      RiD Scourge
     </a>
     , with the sole addition
of a little bit of white-- gray and black make up the main "dark, evil"
colors, with teal also being a major color that serves to give a nice contrast
to all the black and gray while still retaining the figure's cold-toned
color pallete. The silver mane looks incredible, especially with the red
streaks of "wire" going through it. Although the scheme has been used quite
a bit, it's still an awesome color combination, and using it on this mold
doesn't change that. The robot face also seems to look a bit better in
this scheme that it did on Leobreaker. There's also a very neat-looking
Decepticon emblem painted on his right shoulder, with lots of little energy
tendrils around it to make it look more eeevil. However, besides that emblem
design, Nemesis Breaker is otherwise a strict color swap in terms of where
his paint apps are-- although he is an evil clone, I still would've liked
to see a bit more differentiation in where the paint apps were placed for
a $20 repaint.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Given that Leobreaker
can combine with
      <a href="cyprime.html">
       Optimus Prime
      </a>
      , it's only natural
that his evil clone can combine with
      <a href="cygalvatron.html">
       Galvatron
      </a>
      .
(He can also combine with Optimus Prime, which makes no sense, or
      <a href="cymegatron.html">
       Megatron
      </a>
      ,
but the latter doesn't look as cool, considering the conflicting color
schemes.) Galvatron's "Dark Claw Mode" looks just as iffy as Prime's "Savage
Claw Mode" does, but the color schemes of the two toys in Dark Claw Mode
goes together a LOT better than in Prime's Savage Claw Mode-- the only
major difference between Galvatron and Nemesis Breaker's color schemes
is the prevalence of teal on the latter. However, one additional problem
exists with Dark Claw Mode that didn't with Savage Claw Mode, that being
that Galvatron's hip joints simply aren't quite sturdy enough to support
the added weight of Nemesis Breaker-- thus, it's nearly impossible to get
Galvatron to stand up for a reasonable period of time without slumping
sideways at the hips. Needless to say, this is a big downer. Otherwise,
the Dark Claw arm has the same articulation and drawbacks that the Savage
Claw arm has on Prime.

      No mold changes have

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Nemesis Breaker is a
nice repaint of Leobreaker, in the tradition of "evil clone" Decepticons
that have emerged since the turn of the millennium. The mold itself is
definitely below-average for a Cybertron toy, though, and Dark Claw Mode
isn't that great of a combination either, so there's several other toys
in the line I'd recommend before Nemesis Breaker.

        A warrior devoted without question to
Galvatron and the Decepticons, Nemesis Breaker is without a doubt, without
pity; his heart is warmed only by the fire of battle. With a body design
based on that of Leobreaker, he is the equal of that Autobot hero in every
way, but with all sense of honor stripped away. He is a fantastically skilled
fighter with the unfortunate talent of finding and making use of the weaknesses
of almost any opponent.
