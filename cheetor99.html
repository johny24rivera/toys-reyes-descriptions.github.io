    Beast mode is a cheetah.
One of the main problems I have with this mode is that Cheetor looks too
bulky in the front- they could have done without his gut gun there. His
back feet look a little too fat, and his robot parts on his legs are clearly
visible from just about any angle except directly in front. There also
aren't that many movable parts in this mode. Very nice detailing, though,
although the head looks a little more feminine than masculine.

    Robot mode is better
than the beast mode. The only major extra is his beast head on his chest,
and this tends to get in the way some, but it doesn't subtract TOO much
from this mode. He does have his front cheetah legs on his upper back,
but these don't get in the way. The rest of this robot mode looks very
nice, revealing the robot inside very well. One of the nice features is
Cheetor's gut gun. You can fill it up with water and squirt it like make-believe
"poison". This is one of the few deluxes with two weapons, which is nice.
He has a mutant head that isn't on the show, but can be used if you want
to make this repaint a different character than Cheetor.

    A nice deluxe repaint;
better than
    <a href="cheetor.html">
     the original
    </a>
    , in my opinion. Although
at first glance, Cheetor looks the same as his original, the yellow color
on the original has been replaced with more of a golden tint, the spots
are now more maroonish than black, and his blue parts are a little darker.
A bit hard to fit his hands and torso plate into his body when transforming
him to beast mode, however.

      Like a bolt of greased lightning, Cheetor
strikes fast and strikes hard. Quiet and confident with incredible reflexes,
he is equally efficient when battling in robot mode or in his artificially
enhanced organic earth form. Constantly stalks the jungle in search of
Predacon enemies, daring them to challenge him and his laser-powered quasar
cannon!
