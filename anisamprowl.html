not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated deluxe

     Prowl isn't so much a
redeco as a significant remold. His actual color scheme has changed very
little, and instead the silly traffic light accessory has been replaced
with an awesome sidecar that forms armor for Prowl in robot mode! Let's
tackle the vehicle mode first, though-- the sidecar looks great against
the "main" part of Prowl, and the front windshield of the sidecar has the
same "pointed bird-face" look that the main part does. It also connects
to the main part of Prowl very solidly, and the proportions are very nice,
as well. Unfortunately, if you look at it more closely you can see a few
problems that stem from it becoming armor for the robot mode. For one,
only the inside half of the wheel rotates, which just looks weird. Also,
there is no real "bottom" to the seat, just some connector pieces and the
samurai helmet. The main part of Prowl has also been "stripped down" a
bit in features to accomodate all the extra play value and pieces of the
sidecar armor (though honestly, I'm okay with this-- SOMETHING has to give
when you're adding this complicated of an accessory). For one, the ninja
stars formed from the inner part of the tires are gone-- stationary pieces
are glued to the toy in their place. Also, some paint apps are gone, and
the sirens on the back end are one color now. The transparent plastic has
been changed to blue instead of a smoky transparent gray-- which looks
much better, in my opinion, especially with the molded-in "circuitry" lines.
There's also been some slight remolding done to some existing pieces--
the windshield piece has been elongated slighly at the nose, and a few
tabs have been molded into the toy to allow it to connect to the armor
in robot mode.

     Before talking about
the armor (which doesn't necessarily HAVE to be attached to the robot mode
at all times, by the by), a few details worth nothing about the core robot
mode-- first, the head is new, and is tinier and more rounded to allow
the helmet to fit earier on it. It looks kinda overly skinny without said
helmet, however. Also, the hands are unpainted, and the side pieces on
the upper legs are black now, not tan. Now, moving onto the armor-- surprisingly,
it's almost one solid piece. The wheel and flip-out energy sword/shield
combo is mounted on the back of either hand and looks great, though I wish
the blade was slightly larger, The rest of the armor fits around Prowl's
main body, though, with the main point of connection being tabs on his
shoulder armor pieces. Many people have complained about the connection
points here being too weak and Prowl not being able to wear his armor well,
but thankfully mine doesn't have this problem so it's not universal. The
samurai helmet that rests over Prowl's core head looks rather goofy-looking--
the design is alright, but it fits over the head far too losely and makes
it look like he's wearing glasses and a helmet that're too big for his
noggin. There's also some big unsightly connector pieces coming out of
the back of it, and he's not all that steady on his feet with the added
weight. Otherwise, though, the armor looks boss, with the samurai "skirt"
pieces and extra shoulder armor helping to bulk up Prowl a bit, with the
rest of the pieces up and out of the wave of movement.

     Samurai Prowl is a great
update to an already good toy, giving you not only a solid core figure
but some great armor and weapons as well! Just be careful about getting
one that doesn't connect together all that well. Definitely recommended,
as you get a ton of play value for just a deluxe-class price with this
one.
