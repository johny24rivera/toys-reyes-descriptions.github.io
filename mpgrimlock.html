    Grimlock's mecha t-rex
mode is replicated in this Masterpiece toy down to quite exacting detail
when compared to his cartoon appearance (including the now scientifically-incorrect
posture where his tail nearly drags on the ground). He's pretty huge--
roughly Leader-class size, but with more detail-- His mold detailing is
extraordinary, eith little details like pistons and bolts all over the
place-- including on the chromed plastic INSIDE his tinted-clear neck (like
on the G1 toy, but much more involved)-- it all looks VERY cool. I wish
he had a FEW more paint apps to help break up all the milky gray-- like
on the sides of his tail, for example-- but what he has is adequate, what
with the couple of tubes on his stomach painted, as well as all the chrome
plastic and the details on his legs. His teeth and arms are chrome silver,
and look extremely well-done here-- and yes, his mouth can open and close
(and there's even a little "torch gun" inside his mouth). His other points
of articulation in this mode are at the neck (at two places), shoulders,
elbows, at the base of each of the three fingers on each arm, at the tail
at two different sections along it, and at the hips, knees (at three places),
at the base of each rear claw on his feet, and at the base of his two front
claws on each foot (as one piece). What's quite cool is just how much Grimlock
can swing his bulky tail (which is even more impressive when you consider
his transformation)-- fling it to one side at its base in the middle of
the body, and his head will swing back and forth in that same direction,
in a "thrashing" action! Another gimmick Grimlock has in this mode is that,
by opening up the top of his dino skill and rotating his eye pieces around,
you can give him either toy-accurate blue eyes or show-accurate red eyes.
A very nice touch, that. I am a bit disappointed that he can't store any
of his robot accessories in this mode, though.

    Grimlock's robot mode--
as with most Masterpiece toys-- is where most of the design work is focused
around, and it's exceptionally well-proportioned. With his large shoulders,
beefy arms, bit stomping feet, and barrel chest, this version of Grimlock
perfectly shows off his tough character. I kinda wish that, at this scale,
there was something that could've been done with his "dino bits" other
than just flipping them behind his shoulders and back, but it IS cartoon-accurate,
which is I'm sure what they were going for. At least they stay out of the
way, and the dino head locks into place quite well. (The transformation
itself is a bit simple for a Masterpiece, but still pulls off a few surprises
that tend to give Grimlock his better proportions in this mode than his
G1 toy had-- the way the tail transforms into the legs is particularly
ingenious.) The introduction of a bit more red and black in this mode--
around the waist and upper arms-- helps to give Grimlock a bit more of
that color variety he was lacking in dino mode. The red, blue, and green
bits on his legs also look pretty cool. His articluation is simply astounding--
he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders, elbows (at three points),
at the thumb on each hand; at the base of his index finger and his other
three fingers (as one piece) on his left hand; at the wrists, waist, hips
(at three points), knees (at two points), and at the ankles. Of note is
that one of those points of movement at the knees is a nice lateral joint
that can help Grimlock get his legs at quite an angle with his feet still
flush against the floor-- it's VERY impressive, though his waist movement
is limited a little by the dino kibble on his back. Oh, and in case you're
wondering why Grimlock's right hand has less articulation than his left
hand-- it's because his right hand can actually light up! By pressing a
button on his right shoulder, a BRIGHT red light shines through the hole
in said hand, illuminated either his sword or his gun (whichever he's holding
in that hand) quite well. Just, eh... don't look directly at the fist hole
without a weapon plugged in it. Again, it's REALLY bright. Grimlock's golden
chrome crown fits perfectly on his head in this mode, and fits with the
chrome gold chest quite well. (The chest also has some REALLY nice details
underneath the tinted transparent part, including an Autobot symbol.) Another
gimmick Grimlock has in this mode is that you can flip a switch on the
back of his head to change his optic color from red to blue, just like
you can do to him in dino mode.

    Masterpiece Grimlock
is, appropriately, simply a masterpiece. It's particularly impressive just
how well his robot proportions and articulation are, given his dino mode,
and his gimmicks are top-notch. If I had to nitpick, I'm not fond of how
he can't hold his robot weapons in dino mode, and how simply his dino bits
fold up onto his upper back in robot mode, but again, that latter's G1
accurate. Definitely a prime recommendation for any Transfan, provided
you can afford the fairly hefty price tag.

      Weakness offends Grimlock. He considers
none so weak as those who refuse to use their full strength to command
victories. As a result, he's never had much respect for Optimus Prime.
He barely even considers himself and his Dinobots to be part of the Autobot
army most of the time. He only grudgingly helps the heroic Autobots because
the tyranny of Megatron offends him even more than weakness. He longs for
the day when Optimus Prime makes a final mistake, leaving a vacancy that
Grimlock will be more than happy to fill.
