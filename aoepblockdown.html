    Lockdown's alt mode of
a Lambourghini Aventador MOSTLY makes it over to his Power Battler version
pretty well, with the proportions pretty much intact, and no real robot
extras to speak of. (There are the tips of the orange missiles pretty obvious
on the back end, but detail-wise they fit in with the dark blue grill on
the back, and given the whole "Missile Blast" gimmick on the packaging
[discussed later] I honestly think this looks pretty cool.) Given Lockdown's
transformation, however, there IS one really odd thing about his mode,
and that's his front windshield piece-- it just kinda... sticks up a little
bit above the roof and the surrounding pieces. Pushing it down causes the
surrounding pieces to unhinge a bit from their set places, so it's best
to leave it in place. Honestly it partially ruins the whole "sleek" thing
the Aventador has going for it, and just plain looks weird. Another (more
minor) oddity is that this version of Lockdown has a rather medium-to-slightly-light
shade of milky, glossy gray plastic used for the main color of the vehicle,
whereas all his others had a (more movie-accurate) dark grayish brown color--
I'm not sure why that wasn't replicated here. Given all the glossiness
and milkiness of this color, it doesn't look as boring as other grays,
but this mode definitely needed more paint-- there's some silver paint
on the windows and car doors (the latter of which is molded in black plastic),
and some dark blue along the vents on the back end, but that's it. All
of the other vehicle-specific mold detailing in this mode-- the front grill,
headlights, taillights-- it's all completely unpainted. This is particularly
an issue with the front grill, given how, with the plastic breakup and
all, one part of the grill is light gray and another part is orange.

    Lockdown's transformation
to robot mode is quite simple, even for a Power Battler-- you basically
just unfold his arms and legs from the sides and stand him up, resulting
in... well, one oddly-proportioned robot mode. Lockdown in the movie is
rather buff, and this toy of him is decidedly not. In fact, from a side
view he's very flat, with both the main body and the legs too skinny. Fron
the front, his arms are too skinny as well, and very obviously just molded
into the sides of the rear of his vehicle mode-- the robot detailing is
hidden a bit
    <i>
     too
    </i>
    much by the vehicle shell bits surrounding them.
The legs are also tremendously awkward, with the lower legs actually BEHIND
the upper legs and mostly hollow on the outside, with only a bit of robot
mode detailing on them. The feet are merely molded on the inside of the
car doors, but given the ball joints at the ankles they do a good job of
keeping him stable. The main body looks decent from the front in terms
of mold detailing-- it's VERY intricate, catching all the major and minor
details of Lockdown's CGI model and-- quite surprisingly-- PAINTING a lot
of them, with various silver and dark metallic blue paint apps all over
his chest, waist, and thighs. His head is a bit small proportionally, though,
and his chest a bit flat. His face is molded with the "mask down" face,
as all of his toys except for his
    <a href="aoelockdown.html">
     deluxe
    </a>
    have. The light gray glossy plastic used for his main body and head is
very "off", though, not even taking the movie model into account-- the
only positive being that the orange plastic on the missiles contrasts with
it well. Lockdown also has a pretty obvious and very ugly extra-- the windshield
and center piece of the roof on his back. And it's not on his UPPER back
either, thanks to his gimmick-- nope, the windshield sticks straight out
from his butt and the middle roof section just dangles behind his legs
very awkwardly. You can push this piece up a bit to hide it slightly, but
then the gimmick can't be activated, and this piece still sticks out about
75% as bad, so it's generally not worth it. As for Lockdown's gimmick--
I like it, but not how much they had to sacrifice the rest of the robot
mode to achieve it. Basically, if you slide his sticks-out-like-a-sore-thumb
orange left knee inwards, the missile pods over Lockdown's shoulders will
aim themselves forward (assuming the windshield piece on his back isn't
blocking them from doing so) and automatically fire once the triggers hit
his shoulders-- and they're spring-loaded launchers, too. It's kind of
a neat little tip-of-the-hat to what he did once in the movie, but given
the weird orange knee, how much they stick up behind his back and can't
be hidden, and how much they force Lockdown's windshield piece to stay
behind his butt, it's just implemented badly. As for articulation, Lockdown
can move at the shoulders (at two points), side-to-side at the wrists a
bit, side-to-side at the knees a bit (pretty much useless articulation,
really), and at the ankles, which are basically just ball-jointed to keep
him stable in his odd stance. His only really functional movement is in
his shoulders, to be honest, which is a bit poor even for a toy from the
Power Battlers subline.

    Power Battler Lockdown
admittedly has a kinda neat "auto-fire" missile gimmick in his robot mode
and a generally solid vehicle mode (windshield piece excepted), but too
much has been sacrificed to make his missile gimmick work. His robot mode
is incredibly awkward-looking and not really threatening at all, with all
the vehicle kibble bits and two-dimensional pieces that make up most of
his limbs. His odd milky light gray coloration of his body in robot mode
and the still-too-light gray in vehicle mode is a little off-putting, as
well. If you want a simple-to-transform version of movie Lockdown, go for
