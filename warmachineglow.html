    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Marvel TF Iron Man
sportscar. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Marvel TF Iron Man sportscar

     As you'd expect from
a War Machine redeco, the color scheme for this toy is primarily black
with some silver/gray highlights. The silver paint looks particularly good,
and is quite striking in the double racing stripes running down the top
of the vehicle mode-- they really help to add some excellent contrast to
that mode. The shade of glossy gray plastic used for parts of the mech
mode is pretty close to the silver in overall coloration, so it fits pretty
well with the overall scheme, if not quite as well as the painted silver.
That said, just those two colors would make War Machine rather monochromatic
(and he does look a bit like that in mech mode); however, the brick red
paint used for the windows in vehicle mode looks REALLY nice, both in terms
of adding another color to the mix and in terms of how well it fits with
the overall color scheme without getting gaudy. War Machine also has a
bit of glow-in-the-dark off-white paint added to the figure-- on the headlights,
the triangle "power reactor" on the chestpiece, and on the eyes in mech
mode (the taillights are painted light red). It's not nearly as much as
the

      other figure
     </a>
     in this wave, but it still
glows quite well and is a neat feature, even if you can't exactly do much
with it. It also isn't really used enough to make it a contributing factor
to the color scheme, either, but it does contrast nicely with the black
and silver where it's used.

     No mold changes have
been made to the sportscar version of War Machine, but it does have the
fixed knee-pegs that later iterations of the Iron Man sportscar mold also
have.

     The War Machine sportscar
is an awesome redeco of one of the best Marvel TF Crossover molds. The
silver is used in rather dynamic paint apps (particularly in vehicle mode),
the brick red really helps to add a bit more color to him (again, particularly
in vehicle mode), and the glow-in-the-dark bits are a nice touch. Highly
recommended-- and recommended over every other iteration of this mold as
of this writing (6/12).

       Most versions of the War Machine armor
aren't known for their speed, but this one makes up for it. Designed with
high-speed battles in mind, this armor combines the latest in firepower
with the acceleration of a top-of-the-line super car. Nothing stands in
the way of War Machine when he's got the pedal to the medal!
