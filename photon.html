    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Spyshot 6. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Spyshot 6

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Photon, being an eeevil
Decepticon, has a primarily black color scheme compared to his heroic Autobot
clone Spyshot. Photon's color scheme is certainly realistic for a camera,
though, and the gray and silver paint apps around his clear plastic lens
only help to make him look more realistic. The spice up the color scheme
in camera mode, a bit of dark blue coloring has been added to the "connector
ports" in camera mode, and it goes very well against the gray (though it
doesn't quite as well against the already-dark black). Photon's "viewfinder"
sticker on his back has been modified, this time to show an actual Movie
character-- Frenzy-- being "filmed", with the appropriate symbols on the
sides of the "screen", like the battery power and the number of pictures
remaining. In robot mode, Photon's color scheme changes to include a dull
brownish gold color, which gives him a major lighter color to contrast
against the black, and looks very good doing it, too. The head, being a
mix of gray, metallic gold, and dark blue is an especially stunning color
combo, though the head looks too "Autobot-ish" for a Decepticon, honestly.

     Photon T-34 is a great
repaint of one of the best Real Gear molds, with some great color choices,
particularly the gold and dark blue. Photon looks too "nice" to be a Decepticon,
but other than that it's hard to find a flaw with him. Highly recommended.

       Photon T-34 works alone. He doesn't
like other robots getting in the way of his work, which is sabotaging Autobot
structures. Special sensors in his lenses let him target and analyze the
worst weakness of any structure. He uses this data to plan the dramatic
destruction of roads, bridges and buildings when the Autobots least expect
it.
