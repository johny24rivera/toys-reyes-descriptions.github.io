    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Skydive.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Skydive

     Universe Skydive's color
scheme definitely gives off a "fiery" vibe. Almost like he's the guardian
of a volcano or something. The red and transparent bits on him compare
with lava quite a bit, and the gray-brown kinda resembles ash. The brown
parts top off the nicely-done color scheme with their resemblance of dirt.
On top of that, Skydive's chest has even MORE paint detaling than it had
the first time around- there's little white and yellow dots everywhere,
man. Skydive's Energon radiation is unusually subtle for a Universe figure-
in fact, if I hadn't been told it was the Energon radiation, I wouldn't
have noticed it. It's the red spray patterns on the "bone" parts of the
inside of his wings. Nothing really eye-catching, but then again, Skydive
is a very lithe Transformer, and doesn't really HAVE any big parts to do
fancy Energon patterns on. One rather small complaint- does Skydive REALLY
need an Autobot symbol on each of his wings? The one on his chest is very
prominent in both modes. He doesn't need to be freaking covered in the
emblems, Hasbro.

     Universe Skydive is
a great fire-themed repaint, don't get me wrong. However... I don't think
ANYTHING can beat the purple-and-orange scheme of the original Beast Machines
version. Thus, I'd have to recommend the former over this one, even though
they're both GREAT schemes. It's such a unique mold, and the robot mode
just looks so cool. So if you can't find the Beast Machines version for
a reasonable price, Universe Skydive makes a great substitute.
