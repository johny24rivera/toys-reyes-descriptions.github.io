    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM deluxe
Roadbuster toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM deluxe Roadbuster toy

     This Wal-Mart exclusive
redeco of Roadbuster largely keeps his distribution of colors the same,
but homages another version of this car-- namely, one where the dark green
of the original has been replaced with a light orange. Combined with the
white stripes on the sides, this is a DYNAMITE color choice, and not only
do the colors complement each other well, but it has a bit of a "creamsicle"
vibe that I really like for some reason. The change from dark green to
orange is the most obvious change for this redeco, but it's far from the
only one. The gray parts in robot mode are still gray, but they're a bit
darker shade of the color, and looks a little bit better overall, since
they help contrast with all that light orange. The transparent plastic
has also gone from a light blue to a clear tinted shade-- this is a slight
negative, in my opinion, as I generally just think that colored transparent
plastic looks better than a shade of clear (particularly for the robot
optics). The layout of white and black is pretty much the exact same on
this version of Roadbuster compared to the original, though a bit (much-needed)
white has been applied to Roadbuster's legs-- along with a few orange paint
apps, this gives him a bit more variation down there. His head also has
a white stripe down the middle of his "cap", which adds a bit more visual
interest. The Mechtech weapon also has-- bizarrely-- a really bright, "safety"
orange color on the chainsaw blade, making it look a bit more like an energy
weapon than a regular sawblade. I think they could have toned down the
shade a little, but it and the light red bits on the Mechtech weapon still
look quite nice. The other major change here are that some of Track Battle
Roadbuster's decals have changed; his "Amp Energy" logo on his front hood
is larger, with "Energy Juice" now part of the logo; "IMPALA" is now clearly
written on his front bumper; and the National Guard logos have been made
a bit larger and moved to the back of the sides of the car, with a larger
National Guard logo on the top of the car, behind the rear window. Roadbuster's
other logos, like his "88"s and his small NASCAR logo, are still intact
and in the same places as before.

     Track Battle Roadbuster
is a great repaint that gives the Wrecker mold a bit of a brighter color
scheme that the DotM Wreckers definitely lacked. The increased color variety
in robot mode and better use of colors in vehicle mode make this my more
recommended of the two versions, but beware-- this toy saw a considerably
more limited release compared to the original, and as such will be harder
to find/more expensive to purchase than the first release of the DotM deluxe
Roadbuster mold.

       Supercharged and ready for action, Roadbuster
is itching to try out his newest weaponry against any Decepticon dumb enough
to show his face. The Autobot tinkerer has souped up his engine, boosted
the output of his cannons, and reinforced his armor in anticipation of
the next big battle. He can't wait!
