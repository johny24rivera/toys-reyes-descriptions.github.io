    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars Buzzclaw. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars Buzzclaw

     The Virulent Clones are,
obviously, clones-- created from the genetic material of the Insecticons
     <a href="bcbuzzclaw.html">
      Buzzclaw
     </a>
     and
     <a href="bcdirge.html">
      Dirge
     </a>
     .
Thus the clones, who are sold in $35 sets of two, share some major color
scheme features in common with their predecessors, but still are thankfully
different. The Virulent Clones still have the same wonderful red-and-black
wing and tail-shield paint apps and the same red-purple eyes as the other
two Insecticons, and they also share the same yellow paint apps that Buzzclaw
has. Where they differ, however, is that instead of being a transparent
purple or yellow, their bodies are a solid black-- and, instead of having
their upper appendages and insect feet and arms black, they're now a dull
blue. They actually look more different from Buzzclaw and Dirge than the
latter two do from each other, if you ask me. The Virulent Clones' schemes
are still close enough to the other two to defintiely be recognized as
sharing the Insecticon color theme, however, and I think the black and
blue goes together very nicely with the red and yellow. The solid black,
though it still looks good of course, also doesn't look quite as "special"
as the transparent plastic on Buzzclaw and Dirge, which is certainly appropriate,
given that they're just clones. The only downside to making the plastic
a solid black is that the dull yellow paint apps on the legs, which were
just fine on Buzzclaw, now don't quite cover up the dark color behind them,
so the black "leaks through" a bit. This is a rather small quibble, however.

     No mold changes have
been made to the Virulent Clones from their predecessors; however, like
on the other Botcon Buzzclaw repaints, the mandibles have been assembled
the wrong way; to fix this, you need to unscrew the bolt connecting the
insect head to the neck, crack open the halves (don't put too much force
into it), switch the mandibles around so they're facing the other direction,
and then reassemble the thing again. It's rather difficult, though, and
you can break some of the pegs holding together the two head halves if
you're not careful, so I only recommend doing this is you're experienced
with taking apart and reassembling toys.

     Of note is that in addition
to being a Botcon 2005 exclusive, you could only buy the Virulent Clones
at the convention-- it was not available free to preregistrants or available
at all to those who did not attend the convention. The Virulent Clones
were limited to 400 sets (800 pieces total), so they're worth a pretty
penny.

     The Virulent Clone is
a very nice repaint of the Beast Wars Buzzclaw mold, with enough color
similarities to Botcon Buzzclaw and Dirge to identify them as a group while
still being different enough to stand apart. It irks me that the toy was
only sold in sets of two, however-- definitely a factor that should weight
on your decision to buy an already expensive exclusive toy. Color-wise,
I rate the Clones a little better than Dirge, but worse than Botcon Buzzclaw.

       The Insecticon Virulent Clones were
the result of Deathsaurus' resurrection of the latent Insecticon cloning
capability. Extracted from the Cybertronian genetic codes of Buzzclaw and
Dirge, the Insecticon Clones were created to act as a self-replicating
source of warriors for the Decepticon army. Each has a very rudimentary
intelligence with no personality of its own. This makes them ideal for
swarming enemies, with little regard for their own safety. The Clones listen
to their Insecticon masters, Buzzclaw and Dirge, and will follow their
orders to the letter at all times.

       Abilities: The claws and mandibles of
each clone secrete acid, which helps them tear into enemy armor. The Clones
are capable of consuming almost any material to convert into energy to
sustain their systems. In robot mode, each Clone carries a shield that
can absorb energy from an enemy's attacks and redirect them back at them.
They can use their wrist mounted claws as slashing weapons, and each has
a basic level of hand-to-hand combat knowledge based on memory implants
from Buzzclaw.

       Weaknesses: The exo-structure of the
Clones are not as strong as those of Buzzclaw and Dirge. Thus the Clones
are easily destroyed. It is their massive number, which serves as their
greatest advantage.
