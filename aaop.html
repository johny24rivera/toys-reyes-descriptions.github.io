    Air Attack Optimus Primal's
(commonly abbreviated AAOP) beast mode is a technorganic gorilla. As stated
above, AAOP was only released in Toys 'R Us stores as an exclusive. This
mode is incredibly well-detailed, with fur detailing everywhere it's needed,
and some mechanical detailing here and there as well. The only part that's
really sparsely detailed is the armplates, but this is to create a smooth,
armored impression. Speaking of the armplates, that's one downside to this
mode; they don't really "clip on" anything underneath them, and thusly
don't fit all that snugly. So the end parts tend to flop around a bit.
That isn't what really bugs me about this mode, however; it's the fact
that his beast mode legs really aren't all that convincing. They're obviously
his robot legs folded in half, and this detracts from the overall look
of this mode quite a bit. His feet (which form the upper legs in his robot
mode) also look like they have sandles on them. Also, a rather odd "extra"
was thrown in this mode- Optimus Primal has a pink butt! Not only is it
extremely odd, but actually adds a bit of comedic value to a toy that should
have none. And the panel sort of "hangs out" in this mode- it doesn't connect
to anything, and sort of gets in the way of leg movement a little. On the
other hand, AAOP's beast mode face is excellently detailed, and actually
has a little electronic gimmick. If you press AAOP's chest to "power him
up" (during which he makes a slight droning sound), then press down on
his head, he'll say one of two things: either "RAAAAaaar!" or "Optimus,
Maximize!" (even though Primal doesn't maximize in the Beast Machines cartoon).
One of the best parts about this gimmick is that the voice not only comes
through very clear, but it's Gary Chalk himself doing the voice work! Good
job with that one, Hasbro! One more note about this mode- although the
instructions say to actually bend Optimus' midsection back a little bit
for the "hunched" look, it actually causes there to be a big gap between
the chest and the stomach, so I just leave the midsection straight, as
it looks much better.

    Unlike his "merely okay"
beast mode, Optimus Primal's robot mode just plain rocks. The only bad
things about it at all are A. The arm plates that look rather odd hanging
off his upper arms, B. The "pink butt" panel right behind his head, and
C. The off-white color on his lower chest and hands doesn't fit in with
the rest of the color scheme. Other than these three flaws, this mode is
awesome (albeit the second flaw is a rather silly-looking one). Optimus
Primal retains all the awesome detailing from his other mode, and, in fact,
gets even more of it, in the form of paint detailing. Nice detailing on
the back of his forearms, on his feet, midsection, and head are all incredibly
well done. Optimus Primal is also incredibly well-articulated, even for
such a large toy. Not only does he have all the standard articulation,
including hip, ankle, knee, shoulder, waist, head, and elbow articulation,
but his four fingers have TWO points of articulation EACH! (The thumbs
have only one point each.) This is incredible, and allows for some really
neat gestures. What's also really neat about this mode is that the electronic
gimmicks don't get in the way much, and he's got tons of 'em. To activate
them all, you've got to press on his chest to enter his "power up" mode.
Although the droning noise in the background IS a tad annoying, it's a
plus because of the bonus that you don't accidentally activate any of his
sound gimmicks if you don't want to. Like the beast mode, if you press
down his head while he's "powered up" you get sounds- only this time, you
get three instead of two. They are: 1. "The seeds of the future lie buried
in the past!" 2. "Graaaah!" and 3. "Maximize!". All, again, very clear
and done by Gary Chalk himself. By pulling back on the shield-tab on AAOP's
upper right arm and then pushing it forward a bit (it takes some getting
used to), you can have Primal emit a "punching grunt" sound (provided you
have him "powered-up", of course). This is the only gimmick in the entire
toy that affects playbility- in the right arm, he only has one point of
articulation at the elbow instead of two. This may not seem like much,
but it rather limits the gestures he can make with his fingers on this
hand because of the angle it's at. If you press the tab on Optimus' lower
back, it fires a disk out of his stomach, just like on the Beast Machines
television show. A "firing" sound also sounds if you have him powered up.
A nice touch, if a bit oddly placed on the body. Last but not least, we
have the gimmick that gives Air Attack Optimus Primal his name- if you
have him powered-up, pressing a small button on his upper back will deploy
his jet-pack (which is very well-detailed, I might add). A continuous "thrust"
sound will eminate from him, the thrust sound getting higher or lower in
pitch depending on what motion he's currently doing (flying level, diving,
or climbing higher into the "sky"). This noise effect is VERY well-done,
sort of a "how do they DO that?" kinda thing.

    Air Attack Optimus Primal
is a very neat toy, and with tons of sound gimmicks that don't really hurt
the toy's playability performance at all. However, because of his useless
"pink butt" panel and the fact that his legs look so odd in beast mode,
as well as his arm guards that don't stay in their place that well, I can't
quite bring myself to put him into the "must-buy" category of 9.0 or above.
He's still a really great toy, though, and a value for $30.
