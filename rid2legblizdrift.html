    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Drift toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     It's funny, for each
of the multiple Blizzard Strike Drift redecoes, Hasbro's gone with a different
Blizzard-y color scheme. For this version, they went with a darker arctic
scheme, with the main color by far (especially in vehicle mode) being a
dark milky blue. The main complement/contrast color to this is a light
arctic blue shade, used on the wheels, upper legs, and a few other minor
parts. It's a pretty good basic color scheme-- on a larger toy I'd need
a bit more, but on a toy this small it looks spiffy. Of course, just blue
wouldn't make it enough regardless of the size, so Drift has a few other
accent colors. My favorite is the white "snow streaks" on the front hood--
there's also some white on part of the sides; on the faux headcrest on
his front grill; and on the robot shoulders. Obviously, this adds more
to the "arctic" feel of the toy. Drift has black paint on his front and
part of his side windows (but oddly not the rear side windows or his rear
window-- just like his original Legion figure, unfortunately), on his front
grill, and on the chest straps and waist in his robot mode. I kinda wish
they had used white instead in its place for some more contrast, but the
black certainly isn't bad. There's also a titch of silver used for Drift's
face-- not really enough to do anything but make his face stand out a bit.
Finally, there's some medium blue on his headlights, but nowhere else--
unfortunately, they aren't light enough to really stand out against the
dark blue plastic.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Blizzard Strike Drift.

     If you're only getting
one "Blizzard Strike" redeco of Drift, I'd make it the lovely metallic

version
     </a>
     . However, if you're wanting a Legion class version and don't
care about show accuracy, I'd recommend this color scheme over his original
one-- it's a bit more original and I DO love those "snow" apps on the hood.
Mildly recommended.
