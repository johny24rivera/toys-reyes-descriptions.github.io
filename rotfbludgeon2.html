    *2018 UPDATE/BUYER BEWARE: After several
years, reports have come about the rubber treads on Bludgeon starting to
emit a sort of slimy gunk that actually EATS THROUGH the surrounding plastic.
Keep this in mind when purchasing this toy.*

     Bludgeon gets a big upgrade
in the RotF toyline, and he's not
     <a href="mastermetallikato.html">
      just
a repaint
     </a>
     this time! This time around the mold is a much more direct
homage to G1 Bludgeon. His vehicle mode is a tank, and proportionally is
spot-on. There's no robot extras whatsoever in tank mode, though a couple
of details near the front don't match up with the the tank details, both
in terms of the orange color and just the mold and paint detailing. However,
it fits in with the overall shape, so I don't know if I'd outright call
it "robot kibble". Speaking of detailing, though, the mold detailing in
this mode is fantastic-- there's little grates, handlebars, pipes, panels,
etc. all over the place. Unfortunately most of the paint detailing was
saved for robot mode, which makes this mode a bit one-note in that respect.
The light gray serves as a nice secondary light contrast color, though
unfortunately it's the same boring shade of light gray that's used far
too much on Transformers these days. As far as movement, the tank turret
can rotate 360 degrees, as can the small light gray gun on top of the turret.
The treads-- which are mostly rubber-- don't move, unfortunately, due to
the transformation, though there are small wheels on the bottom of the
treads to move Bludgeon along. Also due to the transformation, some of
Bludgeon's treads are odd colors (gray or orange as opposed to black),
which looks a bit telltale. Some black paint should've been used on the
front of those tread-wheels to lessen how much they stand out, methinks.

     As for his robot mode...
wowzers. Rarely is there such a stark contrast in terms of looks between
a Transformer's vehicle and robot modes. Bludgeon's tank mode was bulky
and fairly ordinary-looking, homaging his G1 "real" vehicle mode, while
his robot mode looks like his G1 Pretender shell-- an orange samurai with
a skull for a face! Granted, it's been "robotic-ized" a bit to make it
a bit more believable on this toy without the Pretender gimmick, but it
works very well. The robot-skull look is very cool, and fitting with the
movie look, and the additon of orange and a bit of maroon really makes
the green/gray/black color scheme look a lot better. There's samurai-esque
details all over his body, many done in a very ingenious manner-- the rubber
tread bits hanging from his hips and shoulders looks like "chain mail",
the details around his waist look like samurai armor, his chest is molded
to look like armor while still having a bit of the skull-like visage of
his head. His appendages also have a bony look, being very skinny in the
arms while his legs actually have gray "bones" going through the regular
orange armor-- a very cool look. His clawed feet help to give hiim that
extra touch of "eeevil"-ness. And, what's a samurai without swords, amirite?
Well, Bludgeon's got two-- the main cannon from tank mode ingeniously slides
out to become a long sword, while opening up his turret-backpack unveils
a sheath for another, smaller dagger! (The large turret-backpack can admittedly
hinder movement a little, but Bludgeon's still quite stable due to his
big feet, and it can rotate if it gets in the way of a pose you want.)
His hands can hold both, though in addition to storing his larger sword
in his tank turret, there's also a hole for Bludgeon to sheath it in his
"armor skirt" like a proper samurai warrior. The fit in his hands is admittedly
a little tight for the long sword, though-- some have reported the hand
pieces actually snapping under the pressure. It's not a universal problem,
but be careful. Bludgeon's articluation is pretty decent-- he can move
at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at three points), hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), and the ankles. All the armor can
get in the way a bit at the hips, but otherwise he has a pretty good range
of movement.

     RotF voyager-class Bludgeon
is an excellent example of a proper homage, and one done brilliantly. Practically
everything about Bludgeon is so unique and brilliant-- his mold detailing,
his samurai-skull look, the way his tank parts incorporate into that look
in robot mode, his weapons, the great proportions in vehicle mode-- that's
it's very easy to overlook the couple of small downsides like the oddly-colored
treads in vehicle mode or the limited mobility around the waist in robot
mode. Highly recommended.

       Decepticon Bludgeon was nearly destroyed
by a fight with the Metallikato master Autobot Whirl. Forced to retreat
and hide, he scanned a new vehicle mode and disappeared into the Southeast
Asian jungle. He is desperate to prove himself against an Autobot, however,
so he has caused just enough chaos locally to attract the attention of
Ironhide. Now he lies in wait for the Autobot, ready to spring his trap
and destroy his victim in an instant.
