    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
crane, just like the "official" version of
    <a href="smokescreen.html">
     Smokescreen
    </a>
    .
In this mode, he's pretty toy-accurate, but with "kiddier" proportions,
of course, to satisfy the very strict safety measures put on Happy Meal
toys. His paint detailing is sparse, but he has enough different colors
of plastic on him where it's really not that noticeable. Smokescreen's
"gimmick" is what really bothers me in this mode, though- what's supposed
to happen is that when you ram Smokescreen into a wall, his crane will
pop off as "battle damage". However, the thing pops off ridiculously easy,
and thus is incredibly annoying. Smokescreen's robot head is also rather
visible on the back half of this mode, even more so than Super-Con Armada
Smokescreen's. He has a Powerlinx port on the rear in this mode, but it's
only usable in robot mode, due to the plastic partially surrounding it.
He also has a Minicon port on the bottom front of this mode, and looks
rather decent when powerlinked to a larger Transformer.

    Robot mode is ridiciously
stupid-looking. His arms hang off his BACK instead of at his sides, and
start lower than his chest to boot. His "feet" are just a small panel to
keep him upright, and the crane part on his back keeps popping off (again).
His head and chest assembly also stick out far in front of the rest of
his body, and leaves a large hollow space behind them. He just looks really
weird! Not to mention that only his head can move within a reasonable limit
in this mode, severely limiting his playability. Smokescreen's got his
Autobot symbol below his chest.

    Smokescreen has a somewhat
kinda decent vehicle mode, but the rest of him just bites, plain and simple.
They didn't even try with this one.
