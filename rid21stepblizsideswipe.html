    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     <a href="rid21stepsideswipev2.html">
      "v2"
Sideswipe 1-step
     </a>
     released earlier in the same year, but rather a redeco
of the original Sideswipe 1-step mold. Which, quite frankly, is fine with
me, given my opinion of the "v2" mold. Anyways, the Blizzard Strike redecoes
are always very "arctic-y" in their decoes, and this Blizzard Strike redeco
is no different. The main color-- especially in vehicle mode-- is a very
pale off-white with a bluish tint that makes it look like snow, which is
of course an appropriate color. There's some dark blue-- considerably more
prevalent in robot mode than in vehicle mode-- that is also an arctic-y
"flavor". It both contrasts and complements the pale off-white extremely
well-- this is particularly prevalent in vehicle mode where it's used on
the Japanese symbol details. Even better, the dark blue plastic has a bit
of glitter in it, so it looks semi-metallic or like it's got a bit of a
"sheen" like ice. For the neutral color, Sideswipe has a decent amount
of black-- on some obvious parts like the wheels and on the front windshield,
as well as the fake "wheel" details molded on his shoulders and fake windshield
details behind his main body. As for some of the more minor colors, there's
some silver paint on the waist and face of the robot mode, and some fairly
light blue paint on the vehicle headlights and on the robot eyes-- they
look good, but the silver on the face is a bit too similar to the bluish
off-white plastic. The silver DOES work well against the dark blue, though,
and the light blue works well against the off-white, so they're nice accent
colors.

     The idea behind Blizzard
Strike Sideswipe may have been done quite a bit in the RID2015 line by
this point, but that doesn't mean it doesn't look good. Using an off-white
color as a base helps to differentiate him a bit more from the other Blizzard
Strike toys, but regardless he's got a dynamite color scheme that really
attracts the eye. My personal favorite version of this mold.
