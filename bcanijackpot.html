    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated deluxe
Jazz. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Animated Jackpot is a
pretty direct homage to the G1 Action Master of the same name, and has
much of the same look and personality (and an alt mode now, too). In car
mode, Jackpot's main feature is the nifty red-and-dark-orange stripe going
down the center of his otherwise primarily black color scheme. The stripes
really helps bring some attractiveness to the mode, though it's far from
the only paint app on Jackpot in vehicle mode. He's also light red windows
(painted red in the back in a noticeably lighter shade, unfortunately,
leading to a color mismatch there), along with some nice silver paint apps
on the wheel hubs and tailpipes. The light gray plastic on him has a slightly
glittery-metallic shade to it as well, making it not nearly as boring as
the light gray plastic you see on many TFs nowadays. In robot mode, Jackpot's
yellow plastic adds a bit more to the color scheme. If you've been reading
my reviews for a while, you know I'm generally not fond of the color yellow,
but used as a secondary color with black here, it looks pretty nice. It
also helps that even with all the paint apps on Jackpot's vehicle mode,
he's got plenty in robot mode, such as those on his waist (even the "pouches"
on the hips!), shoulders, and head.

     Speaking of the head,
Jackpot's got a new exclusive one made just for this toy. It's very well-sculpted,
taking the style of Animated and the characteristic "smirk" of many of
its characters and applying that quite well to Jackpot's G1 head, making
for a more angular and rather unique head sculpt. Painting the face, eyes,
chin, and forehead different colors also really helps to make it stand
out, too.

I think Botcon 2011's

     is a slightly
better rendition of this mold, Jackpot is an excellent Animated-style "upgrade"
to his G1 Action Master self and has an excellent color scheme in both
modes with plenty of paint apps and a great new head sculpt. If you like
Animated and are in the market for high-end toys like this, this is an
easily recommended purchase.

       Jackpot coasts through life with a smile
and a firm belief that everything will turn out okay. Because for him,
it usually does. No matter how dire the situation, things seem to come
out all right in the end. Of course, he realizes that sometimes luck needs
a helping hand, and can typically find some way to tilt the odds in his
favor... even when he's being chased by a pack of angry Decepticons (or
more recently, Transtech police). He uses his incredible luck and high
speed (up to 225 mph in roadster mode) to make up for a general lack of
power. In both modes, his side-pipes are photon emitters that can produce
blinding light shows, or be focused into concentrated heat beams.
