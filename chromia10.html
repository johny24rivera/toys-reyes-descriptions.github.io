    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Slugslinger. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Slugslinger

     Continuing the "pre-Beast
Wars" theme of the Botcon 2006 set, Airazor gets a vehicular form as well!
The color scheme is very nice, and spot-on Airazor. The light glittery
brown is a particularly attractive shade, and looks great against the orange-yellow.
The two colors together are, of course, the original
     <a href="airazor.html">
      BW
Airazor
     </a>
     toy's colors, only with the shades tweaked a bit to look more
vibrant. The gold, silver and black also go very well with the brown, though
my favorite color is a one new to Airazor-- a very attractive transparent
teal used for the two cockpits and the tip of the missile. It's a great
color to add to the mix, and gives Airazor a "cool" color to go with all
the warm colors. She also has plenty of paint apps, so no problem there,
though most of them are in the same places on this figure that they were
on Slugslinger.

     Airazor's head has been
remolded into a perfect likeness of her head in the Beast Wars TV show--
it's far more accruate than the original BW Airazor toy head, in fact!
It retains all the major features of Airazor's head, but without the beast-y
bird feathers (which certainly makes sense, of course). Otherwise, no mold
changes have been made to Airazor-- she still has the same shoulder connection
problem that plagued Slugslinger, unfortunately.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Pre-BW Airazor is a
great mold with a great color scheme and an awesome head remold. Overall
I think she looks better with Energon Slugslinger in terms of colors, but
when you combined the rather steep price, even for a Club exclusive, with
the fact that I think Slugslinger's head mold looks more interesting than
Airazor's (even though they did all with Airazor's head mold that they
could, of course), you're probably better getting Slugslinger unless you're
a particularly huge Airazor fan or competist.

       The Maximal Imperium employs many different
tactics in their attempts to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. The
smart and sassy pilot of the Chromia 10 heads up one of the numerous Maximal
Squadrons assigned to prevent any rogue Predacon factions from operating
outside the terms of the Pax Cybertronia. Airazor and her team are often
delegated recon missions deep within Predacon space where many Maximals
dare not venture. Her fellow pilots are inspired by her willingness to
put herself in harm's way if it means protecting the peace the Maximals
hold so dear. In vehicle mode she is able to observe her targets at a range
of up to 30,000 feet and recreate any enemy intel she comes across with
3-D virtual reality maps. Equipped with a titanium plated exo-structure,
in robot mode her weapon of choice is her retractable photon cannon.
