    Vehicle mode is a space
shuttle. Although a bit simplistic in its design (there's not much mold
or paint detailing in this mode at all), the overall design and proportions
are nice, with no extras whatsoever. There's also nice Decepticon symbols
on the wings. Speaking of the wings, their color is a couple shades lighter
than the very light gray used for the main body of the space shuttle, and
it makes it look rather odd in that way. A closer shade of color could
surely have been chosen. What I really don't like about this mode, however,
is the use of the dull yellow-green fade on the middle of the body. I realize
that it's supposed to give the space shuttle a "worn" look, but it just
makes it look like the plastic's yellowing. :\ Oddly, Movor is the only
basic

    component that can't hold
all his weapons in his alt mode in a convincing manner. Although his two
larger guns can be plugged onto his backside (see above), his smaller gun
can't be plugged in a hidden-away area. You can plug it into the top engine
hole on the backside, but it sticks out VERY obviously there and just looks
odd.

    Although Movor's robot
mode has more pleasing overall proportions than, say,

    ,
his doesn't really have any arms. They're very obviously just the front
halves of his space shuttle mode, and they look more like giant oven mitts
than actual arms and hands. Also, Movor's articulation is rather limited
in this mode- he can only move his arms at the shoulders (in two places)
and at the "hands". This makes him very limited in his posability. At least
the orange adds a bit of much-needed variety to the color scheme, although
a bit more paint detailing is still needed.

    Movor is a rather uncreative
and boring transformer, overall. He's worth getting if you want to form
Ruination, but as an individual toy, he just doesn't measure up.
