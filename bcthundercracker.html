not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For

     Thundercracker finally
gets the Classics update many fans wanted (though many hated that it was
a Botcon exclusive), completes the "core" trio of Classics Seekers. However,
though he looks good overall, some odd choices were made. For one, Thundercracker
is NOT the same shade of blue as his
     <a href="g1thundercracker.html">
      original
G1 toy
     </a>
     -- it's noticeably lighter, a more "teal-ish" color. Also, unlike
the Classics Seekers released in the mainline, Thundercracker doesn't have
any colorful stripes, just his rather plain red/white stripes on his wings.
It really doesn't look nearly as good as the decos on the wings of the
mass-released Seekers. However, the color scheme of dark blue, silver,
and black still goes together very well, and all the colors complement
each other very well. Thundercracker could use a little more black and/or
silver, though, as the teal-blue is still by far the dominant color on
the toy.

     Thundercracker is a
fine addition to the Classics Seekers and has quite a nifty color scheme,
though why it's not a darker blue like on the original toy is odd. I also
would've preferred a more original paint job than the slavish G1 stripes
on his wings. Purely on a color basis (not considering cost), I'd recommend
him more than Starscream, but definitely less than

       After being brought back on line by
Megatron, Thundercracker just could not fathom serving alongside Starscream,
the Decepticon who was the cause of his de-activation. Though he would
have been as happy to retire from the war altogether, Thundercracker decided
to join Dirge and Thrust under the command of Bludgeon. Despite his utter
hatred for Starscream, he often finds himself longing for the days when
he was by both Screamer's and Skywarp's side, raining fury down on the
Autobots.
