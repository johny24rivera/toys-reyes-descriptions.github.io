    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Supreme Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Supreme Starscream

     Well, I honestly can
say that this is one mold I never thought would be repainted. Cybertron
Supreme Starscream was a massive "blown up" mold in terms of complexity,
and seemed to solely be as big as he was in the Cybertron toyline because
of one episode. A humongous Starscream divorced from the Cybertron storyline
seems... odd. For this "Year of the Horse" edition, Starscream still keeps
his signature colors--Â  in fact, his color scheme edges MORE G1 than
his Cybertron version. Unlike this mold's previous outing, this version
has some of the Starscream signature dark blue, which contrasts against
the metallic red very well, particularly when both colors are of a nice,
eye-catching metallic shade. (There's also some dark blue that is more
of a flat color that's plastic instead of paint, but it complements and
is close enough to the dark metallic blue to pass as the same color at
a first glance.) There's also a fair amount of yellow/bronze, first in
the form of a translucent, glittery shade for his cockpit, missile launchers,
shoulders, and Cyber Key-unlocked shoulder weapons. It's another shade
that goes with its surrounding colors well, either via complementing them
(as with the red) or by contrasting against them (as with the dark blue
and light gray). Some bronze paint is also used on Starscream's crown piece,
which is another nice shade, but I wish a few more details on the crown
accessory had been painted. Unfortunately, Starscream's gray-- which makes
up the vast majority of his plastic and a good chunk of his color scheme--
is of a rather bland shade. At least it's more of a "straight" light gray
than a milky gray, however, which would have looked even worse. One thing
worth pointing out, though-- Starscream's hips are painted metallic red,
and these go through a lot of pressue and scraping when transforming him,
which means that the red paint on his hips can scrape VERY easily. Honestly,
that was just bad planning-- those should have been solid unpainted plastic.

     "Year of the Horse"
Starscream
is an iffy figure to recommend to even most completists. He's really overly
simplistic for his size, costs a TON of money (over twice the price of
Cybertron Supreme Starscream!), doesn't look vastly different from his
initial cheaper form, has hips that are prone to paint-scraping, and his
light gray is just a bland color. (I do think color-wise he's slightly
better than Cybertron Supreme Starscream, but this version's vastly inflated
price puts his score lower.) Because of all these factors, I'd only recommend
this release for the most diehard Starscream collectors.

       There is no scheme too low for Starscream.
His all-consuming hunger for absolute power overcomes what little reason
there is in him, driving him to adopt ever more vile plots in his quest
to unseat Megatron as leader of the Decepticons. No matter how wildly irresponsible
the plot, he will take any chance he thinks might grant him more power.
Over the years, he has poisoned his systems with more arcane and unstable
technology than any other Decepticon, and one day he will pay the price.
