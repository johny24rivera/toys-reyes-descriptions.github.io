    Optimus Prime's new form
got a star appearance in the
    <i>
     Age of Extinction
    </i>
    line, with this toy
actually being released to some online retailers early in 2014, before
the main line hit store shelves. In vehicle mode Optimus Prime is surprisingly
large-- more akin to the "old" Leader-class size from the mid-2000s than
the newer Leader class size. He's now a more windswept, aerodynamic truck
cab compared to his previous movie form, and this mode looks pretty near-perfect
when compared to the actual customized Western Star truck it's based on.
The lower section in the back may be a TAD short, but only just. There
is one obvious robot mode extra in this mode, and that's the chest easily
visible behind the front window. (There's also a gap in the back end, but
it doesn't reveal anything.) This wouldn't be so bad if the chest weren't
chrome, but it is, so it sticks out like a sore thumb. The side windows
aren't transparent plastic so at least the chest doesn't show from the
sides, but on the other hand this means that the windows mismatch. The
color scheme is pretty much classic Optimus Prime-- you know what you're
getting by now, dark blue and red with some silver/gray. The red used for
Optimus' rather extensive flame paint apps looks like it's a bit duller
of a color than usual, but it still looks great against the dark blue (and
in fact is lighter than it appears in this mode-- the dark blue plastic
"bleeds" through the red paint in this mode, whereas the red paint on Prime's
lower robot arms is the same shade, yet looks lighter). Nearly all of the
gray in this mode-- except for the wheel hubs and the back side of the
truck-- is either painted a rather eye-catching shade of silver, or is
chrome-- something we haven't seen much of lately at all, and in this mode
it's mostly visible on his front grill. As of this writing about three
years later after release (3/17), the chrome is still holding up very well,
so there doesn't seem to be much cause for concern when it comes to chipping.
The various paint apps and chrome do break up Optimus Prime quite well
in this mode, though another few flame apps on the top or the back end
wouldn't have hurt. I will say that this mode is a bit light on the mold
detailing, however-- granted, it's a streamlined truck, but even things
like the "bolts" on the side seem a little fewer in number than usual.
That said, there's still some parts-- like the smokestacks and steps on
the side-- that are quite intricately detailed. Optimus Prime has two weapons--
a rather long sword and very large shield. The shield is the cooler of
the two accessories, having a lot of extremely nifty "energy arc" detailing
on the transparent pale yellow parts, like the silver-painted parts are
"projecting" a larger shield-- it's stored on the top of the rear in this
mode. Not exactly an inconspicious place, but I've seen worse. The sword
slides into a slot on the underside (it can't store on the back in robot
mode, unfortunately). On a small side note, the tires look like they're
rubber, but they're not-- they're plastic, though they still roll quite
well. The paint detailing on the sword isn't as impressive, though having
a silver hilt while the rest of the blade and hilt are yellow make it look
sort of like an energy sword (even though it's not in the movie). The yellow
color in general seems a little "off"-- I think a clear transparent blue
like on Prime's front window would've looked a little better.

    Optimus' transformation
is surprisingly simple for such a large toy, mostly consisting of folding
up his truck panels and connecting his waist and shoulders to his main
body. As far as general proportions go in this mode, the "core" robot mode
is decent; there's plenty of that impressive mold detailing we've come
to expect from movieverse TFs in their robot modes, with little panels
and bolts everywhere, though Optimus Prime's new "knight" status in TF4
makes his core proportions smoother and curved and more like layered armor,
rather than with many obvious vehicle parts on the core robot. (His head
is sculpted with his mouthplate retracted, FYI.) The chest is just a touch
flatter, the arms just a bit skinner, and his feet smaller than his movie
model, but honestly given what the designers had to work with-- little
of Optimus' truck mode is visible AT ALL on his movie model's robot mode--
these are very small sacrifices. What IS a big deal is just the absolute
ton of truck kibble hanging off of Optimus in this mode. Pretty much his
entire truck mode is on his back, with most of the lower sides of said
truck hanging down down to his knees in a very unsightly manner. Granted,
much of the mass on his back is folded up, but it still gets in the way
of movement, particularly at the shoulders and knees. Optimus' legs fare
a bit better; there's still large sections of the truck hanging off the
sides, but parts of the roof and sides at least fold behind his feet to
provide better support. Optimus IS surprisingly stable in this mode despite
his back-heaviness because of this support, as well as the fact that his
ankles are ball jointed. Optimus' other points of articulation are at the
neck, shoulders (at two points, three if you include the blue "flaps"),
elbows (at three points), hips (at two points), and knees (at two points).
His hip "skirt" piece can also move forward a bit to get out of the way
for forwards leg movement. Thus, he's able to get into a decent number
of poses, considering how big his backpack is. Either of his fists can
hold his sword, though there's only a hole for his shield on his left arm,
oddly. Finally, as for colors, considerably more chrome is visible in this
mode, and I generally like it on the chest and upper legs, and the red
and blue chrome paint look pretty nice against all those details, but I
wish the blue was applied a bit thicker or was a bit darker, as it doesn't
quite stick out as much as it should on a few places like the shoulders.
Between the chrome and the paint apps on the appendages, this mode is well-covered
when it comes to paint.

    First Edition Optimus
Prime is a bit of a tough sell at $60 U.S. His truck mode is large and
pretty fantastic and his weapons are nice, but his robot mode has oodles
and OODLES of truck mode parts hanging off of it that just look bad. He's
also a touch simplistic for the size and price, given that he's not aimed
at little kids like the 1-step changers. I understand the constraints the
designers were under, but in robot mode this toy just doesn't cut it as
well as the regular mass-release Leader class AoE Optimus toy does. Only
recommended if you're some sort of Optimus completist, if you value size
and/or lots of pretty chrome over movie accuracy, or if you want a version
of this mold that's more difficult to transform than the 1-steps and simplified
toys, but not as difficult as the mainline Leader release.
