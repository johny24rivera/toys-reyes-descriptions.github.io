    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     All of the "classic six"
Seekers have now been repainted from this mold now, so who else is there?
Why, random-colored Seekers that appeared briefly in the background in
certain episodes of the G1 cartoon, that's who! Acid Storm here is the
"green Seeker" seen in the background in a few episodes of G1, though just
making Starscream green would have made for a fairly boring toy-- in addition
to being green, Acid Storm's got a fairly cool jungle camo deco. The two
different shades of muddy brown look quite nice against the green, and
really help differentiate Acid Storm from the other Seekers-- something
that's particularly important given how many uses this mold has had by
now. Black and the dull pastel blue make for excellent contrast colors,
one being substantially darker than the main green color while the other's
much lighter. I particularly like how much the blue looks like the color
of rain, which fits given Acid Storm's bio lists him as a "rainmaker".
There are a few, very minor, things I'm not all that fond of when it comes
to the paint job, however. For one, his robot arms are completely bereft
of paint apps, which makes them look rather dull against those rather dynamic-looking
wings. Secondly, putting FOUR Decepticon symbols on Acid Storm's vehicle
mode-- two on the main wings and two on the vertical tail wings-- is a
bit overkill, really-- two is definitely enough. Still, as said before,
those are really minor quibbles.

     Acid Storm is an inventive
thematic repaint that adds a new "Seeker" to the typical six that are repainted/remolded
from the Starscream mold. Although he gets major props for originality,
I don't think he tops a few of the other uses of the Seeker mold, though
he outdoes or ties some of the others-- overall, I'd put him in about the
middle as far as ranking how good each of the Starscream repaints looks
in comparison to the others.

       A member of an obscure squad of Decepticon
air warriors known only as "The Rainmakers," Acid Storm is known as an
individual only to his teammates and a very few others. He is highly intelligent,
eager, and dedicated utterly to the Decepticon cause. He has a talent for
marshalling vast amounts of data, as well as a way with words that would
make him a powerful speaker. However, he prefers to remain anonymous, as
part of his team. His hyperion3 blasters can seed natural clouds with a
highly destructive form of acid rain.
