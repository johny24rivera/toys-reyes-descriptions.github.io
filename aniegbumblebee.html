not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Bumblebee, of all 'bots,
in the Elite Guard? Well, at least according to the bio it's his ATTEMPT,
at least. Regardless, Bumblebee still retains his characteristic yellow
for this redeco, but it's considerably less prominent, particularly in
his vehicle mode. Instead black with bronze accents are his new main colors,
and it looks fan-TASTIC. Those two colors together look loads better than
Bumblebee's original, rather blah yellow color scheme. Making the lower
half of the vehicle mode bronze and the top half black also was a cool
touch and makes his vehicle mode look less plain. I don't like how they
just painted black over his siren instead of painting it the requisite
red, though. The yellow still makes him look like Bumblebee (well, moreso
I suppose, given his face sculpt), but it's in a lesser amount and serves
as a very nice contrast color to the black and copper. The silver Elite
Guard symbols, face, and headlights are also a nice contrast and a good
tertiary accent color.

     Elite Guard Bumblebee
is a really nice redeco, retaining enough yellow "Bumblebee-ness" while
making the overall color scheme much better and more visually interesting.
Unless you're a stickler for show accuracy, I'd go for this one over the
original deluxe any day.

       After getting up close to members of
the Autobot Elite Guard, Bumblebee wants more than ever to be one of them.
It is his personal opinion that the one thing the Elite Guard needs to
be perfect is to lighten up a little bit, and he's just the guy to put
the "lite" back in "Elite." His first step to fitting in with the Elite
Guard is to look the part, so he had Sari borrow some of her dad's auto-painting
robots to help him achieve his new look.
