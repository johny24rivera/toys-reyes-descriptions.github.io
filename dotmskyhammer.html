    Skyhammer is the only
"large toy" (i.e., voyager or above) for the DotM line that doesn't appear
in the movie, and as such, his helicopter mode isn't a particular type
of licensed helicopter, though it does highly resemble an Apache. Proportions-wise,
there's not much to complain about here-- there's no "underbelly kibble"
at all, and everything looks pretty spot-on, with the only real robot mode
extras being that his white feet are rather obvious near the tail of the
copter-- but that's VERY minor at best, since they're molded in to fit
in with Skyhammer's silouhette quite well and if it wasn't for them being
a different color, they would've fit right in. Skyhammer's mold is a surprsingly
detailed, with little panels, "rivets" nad the like pretty much everywhere
on him. His paint detailing also works quite well, with the bottom of his
rear two-thirds being painted silver-- that, along with the white and the
yellow-ish colors used for his transparent cockpit and on the rear of his
side thrusters, contrasts well with Skyhammer's dull blue. It's not exactly
an amazing color scheme, but it is fairly realistic and slightly more varied
than most movie characters' color schemes. Skyhammer has three landing
gear to help keep him level in this mode-- the first one underneath his
cockpit can fold back up, but the two behind his wings can only rotate
around circularly, thus being rather obvious even when they're "retracted".
The rotor spins very well, though occasionally the little "knobs" on each
propeller towards the center can hit something slightly as they rotate.
As for weapons, Skyhammer has two (non-firing) missile pods that are normally
stored on the underside of each wing-- they're made to connect with any
Mechtech-sized port, though, so they can be used on most other mainline
DotM figures. Beyond the four he's got underneath his wings, he's also
got one on the side of each of his side thrusters for a total of six. His
Mechtech weapon is a rather overly bulky double-barreled gun that's a rather
ugly shade of light gray, and is so bulky in fact that you can't mount
it anywhere without it looking odd. Pushing foward on the button on the
backside of the weapon causes the weapon to convert into a blade, though
it still retains its bulkiness in this mode. As with most Mechtech weapons,
it can't stay in this "activated" mode, making Skyhammer's Mechtech weapon
rather weak, overall. He also has two area for C-clip weapons near his
side thrusters, in case you want to pump him up with a few of those as
well.

    Transforming Skyhammer
can be a bit challenging the first few times-- his torso and arms in particular
transform in a complex (and rather ingenious) manner-- but it's not overly
frustrating, and it results in a robot mode that's also quite good. First,
the bad-- his main wings hang rather obviously behind his back, though
at least they stay out of the way of most articulation and peg into place.
His helicopter tail fins also hang out behind his lower legs and small
pieces of his cockpit hang up above the rest of his translucent yellow
shoulders, which otherwise look great. Due to his transformation, the way
his upper legs look is also a bit odd, being at a few weird angles to their
surrounding parts. These are all minor issues, though, and Skyhammer is
a really unique helicopter TF (in a good way), with the cockpit halves
forming his shoulders and his lower arms folding into their robot mode
configuration in a cool manner with the thrusters now acting as "guns".
The best part of Skyhammer in this mode, though, has got to be how his
rotors store-- almost all helicopter TFs have their rotors just hanging
off of some part of them in robot mode, but Skyhammer's fold around and
tab in at the sides of his shoulders and waist, looking a bit like a cool
"combat vest" or somesuch. Due to the placement of his Mechtech ports,
Skyhammer can also store his missile pods or weapons on the back of his
lower hands in this mode, though his wing Mechtech ports behind his back
aren't of much use here. Skyhammer's robot parts also also rather nicely
detailed mold-wise, with tubing and armor plating everywhere-- though it's
toned down slightly from most Movie toys, given his lack of an onscreen
model that needed to be reproduced in physical form. His headsculpt also
looks great, with a movie-ish faceplate but a transparent visor over his
eyes, giving him a bit of a "pilot" look. His upper legs could use a little
paint, but overall Skyhammer's various paint apps keep him from looking
too monotonous in this mode. I particularly like the blue used for his
face-- it's a striking shade of the color, and I wish more of it was used
on the toy. As for articulation, Skyhammer can move at the neck, shoulders
(at four points), elbows, inwards at the wrists, and he can also move at
the hips (at two points), waist, and knees (at two points). He could've
used a little ankle movement, but that's really the only thing missing
here-- given his lack of back-heaviness and kibble, you can get him into
some pretty neato poses.

    Dark of the Moon Skyhammer
is definitely the best new-mold voyager toy in the line, with an ingenious
transformation, a decent color scheme and number of paint apps, good proportions
in both modes, and a cool, unique robot mode. There's not much to complain
about here; highly recommended, even if you're not a big fan of the movie
aesthetic.

      Back on Cybertron, Skyhammer was a highly
decorated Autobot aerial assault commander. He was tasked with personally
advising Optimus Prime in countless skirmishes with the Decepticons. Skyhammer
is surprisingly nimble given his size and weapon payload. He is an expert
with projectile weapons, but also excels in hand-to-hand combat. He carries
an Energon blade bestowed on him by Optimus Prime as recognition of extraordinary
courage and heroism in battle.
