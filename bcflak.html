    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Defense Scattorshot.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Defense Scattorshot

     Flak here has a bit of
an interesting history. He was originally going to be released in colors
that were similar to
     <a href="uni2overload.html">
      Universe 2.0 Overload
     </a>
     ,
who himself was a redeco homage to G1 Flak. However, at the time he was
conceived, Fun Publications didn't know about the Overload release, so
when they did, they change Flak's deco to a more "arctic/urban camo" color
scheme that really isn't an homage to Flak at all. So Flak here is a homage
to the G1 character in everything BUT the color scheme, while Universe
2.0 Overload is an homage to Flak only IN the color scheme. Mmmkay... regardless,
I've always liked these arctic/urban camo paint jobs, and Flak is certainly
no exception. The white-and-gray stripes color scheme looks utterly fantastic,
and the dude's COVERED in paint apps-- no boring big patches of plastic
here. Black becomes more apparent in robot mode due to his treads, arms,
and head, and serves as a nice dark contrast color, but what REALLY makes
this figure pop are the small uses of a few minor colors. The red looks
quite nice as a "connector piece" color, especially against the black and
gray. The copper tips to the missiles look REALLY nice, and the transparent
green plastic used for the targeting reticle in robot mode is an interesting
choice, but surprisingly it looks really good. Honestly, I don't have any
problems with this dude's color scheme at all.

     Flak has a new head
mold, based on his G1 version's. It's very well-sculpted, and the green
visor looks quite nice against the other colors, similar to how the transparent
green looks. His Cyber Key is the same mold that comes with Cybertron Defense
Scattorshot, though it has Elite Guard wings painted around the Autobot
symbol in a rather cool effect.

     Botcon 2009 Flak is
a fantastic mold with an utterly fantastic paint job, even if the homage
may be a little screwed up. He's got paint apps everywhere and all these
colors mixing together is fairly original and just really catches the eye.
Definitely my favorite of the color schemes this mold has received-- my
favorite exclusive from the "core" Botcon 2009 boxset, and my 2nd-favorite
exclusive from that year overall. Even if you already have the mold, if
you have the money to be hunting down Botcon exclusives, I'd recommend
considering this guy.

       An experienced "alien fighter" who forged
his career in the Cybertronian Revolution, Flak is a fearsome opponent.
Space pirates, mutants, transorganics... Flak has fought them all, first
as a security officer, then as an explorer, and finally as a shock trooper
under Thunderclash's command. He does not yearn for battle, but it is his
only marketable skill. Off the battlefield, combat doesn't interest him;
it is his job, he does it when needed and he does it well. Each of his
weapons carries a unique feature: incendiary missile launchers conceal
an acid burst cannon and an electron blaster. He carries a negative energy
freeze rifle and has concussive force blasters concealed in his optics.
An expert tactician and long-range combatant, he lacks finesse as a melee
brawler. Flak sometimes has difficulty adjusting his tactics for use against
Cybertronian foes.
