       Offroad Skids trades
his slightly darker green for a more lime-green coloration this time around,
which increases the contrast between that and the dark gray, and looks
quite a bit better overall, in my opinion. The white stripes in vehicle
mode are also a welcome addition, and look great. The silver on the windows
and on the robot legs also looks pretty decent as well-- providing some
contrast, though perhaps giving a darker shade of the color a BIT more
of a presence might've looked a tad better. The other, less prevalent paint
apps-- like the red taillights, yellow headlights, and bronze Cyberglyph
markings on the car doors-- all do an excellent job of accenting the color
scheme, particularly the latter. Another bonus is that Offroad Skids has
pretty much every necessary detail painted in, with the exception of his
front grill.

           Like pretty much any
repaint of Mudflap, this "Rally" version keeps the general orange-and-gray
color scheme of the character but adds in a bit more to mix it up-- in
this case, a healthy dose of black. It fits with the orange quite well,
and serves as a nice dark contrast color that the scheme rather needed.
There is a downside to adding black plastic to Mudflap, though-- in vehicle
mode, having some of the black parts painted over with orange to help the
colors "flow" a bit easier in turn leads to all those unsightly "lines"
across the center that mark different pieces of his robot mode are actually
MORE of an eyesore on this version, due to the black plastic poking through
at the edges. My favorite new thing about Rally Mudflap is the rather nice
fragmented "gold" deco across the bottom half of his vehicle mode-- it
really goes with the other colors quite well, and the look of it makes
it look like it used to be a solid racing stripe, but the edges got "worn
down" over time. Going back to a more negative angle, the new deco does
take paint apps from some rather important details, like the taillights
and Mudflap's robot mode leg detailing.

             If you want to get the
Legends class versions of the Twins, this set is definitely the way to
go-- both of the toys get their best color schemes in this release, in
my opinion. The molds themselves are both pretty mediocre, unfortunately,
but at least they're in an eye-catching color scheme this time around.
