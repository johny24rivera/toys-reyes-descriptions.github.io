    Ultra Magnus' vehicle
mode is a car transport. It's a bit more "kiddie-fied" than his Super version,
in that's it's a bit more "stubby" and kiddie-proportioned. Still, it's
rather nice-looking for a basic-sized version. The detailing is pretty
nice, and pretty accurate to the Super-sized version. The dull yellow used
for the Autobot symbol on the front doesn't really look that good when
compared with the rest of the color scheme, however. The fact that much
of the back half is hollow also takes away from the look of the toy as
well, since you can easily see some of the robot mode internal components
used to make the transformation work. Also, although Ultra Magnus has ten
wheels, only four of them are real ones. The rest are just molded onto
the side, which is rather a cheap move if you ask me. And, to make things
even worse, only two of the six molded-on wheels are even painted! On the
upside, though Ultra Magnus is just the right size to carry a Spychanger
on his back (although it's rather obvious that they're wrong in size in
relation to each other).

    Although the transformation
isn't at all the same, Ultra Magnus' robot mode is remarkably accurate
to his Super version's. The only major difference is the upside-down transport
front hanging off his backside (which also has a tendency to snap off).
And no, he doesn't have a jet pack, sorry. Also, Ultra Magnus' articulation
is pretty darn limited in this mode for a new mold. It seems Hasbro took
the overall Spychanger's articulation and applied it to this guy as well,
which is unfortunate. His arms can only move at the shoulders, and his
legs can only move from side to side. Meh. At least his head can move in
a circle, but that's it. Rather limits playability. Ultra Magnus could
also use a bit more silver detailing on his arms and the middle of legs,
as well. But the detailing still isn't that bad. He still needs a good
weapon, though... Oh, and the Basic version of Ultra Magnus can't combine
with the
    <a href="ridopbasic.html">
     Basic Optimus Prime
    </a>
    , just in case
you're wondering. So no basic
    <a href="omegaprime.html">
     Omega Prime
    </a>
    combination, sorry.

    If you're not able to
afford the Super version of Ultra Magnus, the basic version's an okay substitute.
Just remember that if you spend less, you also get less.
