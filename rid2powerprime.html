      As with most Mini-Con
Weaponizers, I'll start with Aerobolt's "robot" mode first, as so many
of my comments about his alt mode tie into his robot mode. Although really,
Aerobolt's robot mode is a beast mode-- he's a bird. Like with many birdformers,
the legs are a little awkward-- it's like Hasbro doesn't know how to get
bird legs correctly below a bird that still becomes a robot (though...
this one doesn't become a robot, so that excuse is gone). The legs stick
out at a bit of an awkward angle to the rest of the toy, and his feet in
particular are a bit large proportionally, as well. The main bird body
is pretty good overall, however. The wings may be a TAD small and flat,
but those are pretty minor in comparison to the feet. His head is pretty
well-sculpted, but straightforward-- it's a streamlined bird head, not
much else to say about it. The mold detailing on the body is fairly basic,
with the Weaponizer-usual gear around the allegiance symbol, along with
some basic armor plating-like details. There's also little tailfeathers
poking out the back end. The mold detailing in the wings is great, with
fan details in the center and fairly intricate (for RID2015, anyway) blade-like
feathers on the ends. The color scheme is pretty basic-- the main color
is a milky blue, but it's a semi-metallic blue with a good amount of glitter
in it. It's a pretty decent shade. Unfortunately, the only other major
color-- used for the legs, tailfeathers, and back-- is that very blah light
milky gray. Beyond that, the Autobot symbol has been painted red, the beak
is a orangish yellow, and the eyes are somewhat light blue-- though I wish
the eyes were lighter, as it's difficult to even tell they're painted under
normal lighting. For articulation, Aerobolt can move his neck up-and-down,
his feet back-and-forth at the point where they intersect with the body,
and his wings can rotate around the shoulders where they connect to the
body. It's all used for Aerobolt's transformation, but it still means that
Aerobolt is a heck of a lot more articulated in this mode than the other
Power Surge Mini-Cons.

      Aerobolt is the leader
of the Weaponizer Mini-Cons in the show, but the toy... doesn't actually
turn into a weapon. Instead, by just moving Aerobolt's points of articulation
to the opposite end that they are in beast mode you get his... chest armor
mode. Yeeaaah, this mode is pretty weak. It looks like he got run over
on the street and is roadkill. The fans on the wings do work fairly well,
as do the extra little bits of wings on the sides, but otherwise it's pretty
obviously a flattened bird. And even with the fans, they're partially covered
by the bird feet in front of them.

        Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode for this large "Power Surge" version is... well... is it really fair
to call it a vehicle? I mean, there is the RID2015-usual cab section there
in the front, sure. But it's far too short proportionally and the back
80-85% of this vehicle mode is VERY obviously just the robot mode parts
folded up into a vaguely rectangular shape. Putting wheels on the bottom
of the legs near the back doesn't really help this. I guess(?) the large
wing bits are some lame attempt to try to cover this up, but they don't
work, especially since they're above the arms they're supposed to cover
a fair bit. Basically beyond the front cab section, you've got a fairly
solid square-ish section, but that doesn't look like anything. Behind that
there's some very obvious inside portions of clips with some unsightly
rectangular holes in them, and some bits sticking out near the bottom that
almost threaten to interfere with the rolling of the toy. Behind that,
you've got the wing sections (deployed in robot mode) that sit on the top,
about an inch or so above VERY obvious robot shoulders and arms that just
sit there not even really trying to be hid, and on the bottom you've got
the legs clearly there on the bottom, with the upper legs not fitting in
very well with the surrounding areas and the feet just hanging off the
back end, not even really trying to blend in with the rest of the mode
beyond some minor unpainted taillight mold detailing on their bottoms.
As a whole, the mold detailing for this mode is the RID2015-typical of
being fairly minimal, beyond some stylized lines here and there. There's
some nifty angular, ice chip-like details on the wings, the usual RID2015
trio of divots on the front hood, extremely small and warped side doors,
and the usual angular front grill details. The wheels also have some small
bolts molded onto them, which is nice. The rest of this mode is pretty
much just ridges n' such "left over" from the robot mode. The vehicle mode
has some classic bits of Optimus Prime in them, with dark blue mostly on
the back end for the lower legs and arms, and some red on the front cab
section and a bit at the front sides. The dark blue plastic is pretty typical,
but that red is a pretty nifty shade, with some glittery swirls mixed in
to make it semi-metallic in shade. The middle section is mostly a very
light (almost white) shade of gray plastic that helps add some more "light"
to the color scheme, and looks pretty decent if not amazing. Unfortunately
there's also that very blah light milky shade of gray plastic used on Optimus'
feet, fists, and upper legs as well. The wing pieces are a pretty cool
translucent blue, along with much of the sword that is held in between
his fists, essentially "slotted into" the middle of this mode (the hilt
of the sword is more of that blah milky gray). There's also a bit of black
plastic on the wheels and on an activation lever on the top. As for paint,
there's not much aimed at just this mode; just a bit of metallic black
on the windows and silver on the front grill. There's a port on the top
of the front roof to plug in Aerobolt if you want, but it's a pretty weird
place to plug him in, up there. None of the other holes in this mode that
look like they could hold Aerobolt are deep enough, unfortunately. It should
also be noted that the translucent pieces of the wings have VERY shallow
clips that attach them to the off-white lower wings, and come off at the
drop of a hat. It's EXTREMELY annoying, moreso because this is a toy that's
supposed to aimed at a younger audience of Transfan.

        Optimus' transformation
to robot mode is fairly straightforward, though not quite as straightforward
as most of the smaller Power Surge toys. Rotate up the arms from the side
and plug the shoulders in; rotate lower body around at the waist, separate
the legs, and fold out the legs; and then flip back the cab section. Especially
in comparison to the cab mode, this mode looks pretty darned good, except
for the incredibly obvious cab section that doesn't even fold all the way
down behind his back-- Hasbro really didn't allow for ANY intergration
between the two modes on this toy, did they? The wings hang off behind
the waist and legs in a fairly unsightly manner in this "unactivated" state.
The proportions are quite good overall in this mode, looking like a slightly
more beefed-up, wide-shouldered Optimus, though his lower legs are just
a TAD flat when looked at from a side angle. He's got some pretty good
articulation too-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points),
elbows, wrist and waist rotation, and movement at the hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and tilts at the ankles. I mean, that's better than
many Warrior toys, there. It should be noted, however, that Optimus' feet
are quite floppy, particularly the back ends, and worst of all, the ratchets
in his hips feel VERY weak and cheap. Heck, despite being careful, I broke
one of them very shortly after transforming the toy. This is just absolutely
inexcusable on a $50 toy aimed at young kids, who of course aren't going
to handle the toy as carefully as I do. The color scheme is much better
and more varied in this mode, with the dark blue and light milky gray breaking
up most of the toy, with the off-white plasitc on his shoulders and side
of his chest, with the chest itself looking really cool with white paint
over translucent cool blue plastic. The mold detailing on the chest is
pretty cool as well, with some linear vent details patched here and there
amidst the faux headlight details on the sides. He's also got some pretty
spiffy angular details on his shoulders, with some circular "power core"-like
details near the center that are sprayed light blue. Like other Power Surge
toys, Optimus has some light electric blue "electric circuitry" lines on
his upper legs, though they don't contrast all that well against the light
milky gray. There's some really eye-catching light blue paint apps on his
small shoulder fins and on some details on his lower legs that are surrounded
by white paint, really popping against their surroundings. The head has
pretty good detailing of Optimus' maskless silver face with light blue
eyes, and his side antennae on the head are impressively intricately detailed,
especially for a RID2015 toy. A new plastic color has been added to this
mode, as well-- a more medium shade of blue, used on his waist and on part
of his upper back. It's honestly close enough to his dark blue I'm surprised
that wasn't used, as overall it doesn't add much to the color scheme, though
it DOES have some glittery swirls in it, making it look semi-metallic.
Optimus' fists are molded with an extra tab that allows him to wield his
sword quite firmly and solidly.

        Alright, onto the Power
Surge noises and gimmicks. If you press in on the little piece in his waist
with a hole in it, lights on the sides, center, and/or top of his chest
will blink rapidly, and he'll say one of several things: "SURGIIING BLAST!",
along with a firing sound; a transformation sound; a truck "powering down"
sound with his center chest and top lights alternatively blinking; "Transform!"
with a center light in his chest blinking; a quick blasting sound with
his top chest lights blaring; "Roll out!" with his center and top chest
lights alternatively blinking; "Let's settle this in the sky!" with his
center and top chest lights blinking alternatively; and "Power Surge!"
with his center chest and top chest lights lighting up while a "radiation"
sound plays. After that, the toy will stay "on" until about 10 seconds
of non-use, saying another sound clip or two, after which it will turn
itself off without further use. Plug in Aerobolt into his chest and his
wings will flip up, a facemask will slide up in front of his face (with
some really cool light blue wing-like details on the forehead) and his
chest cannons flip out from his shoulders (alternatively, you can press
on a black slider on his upper back to do this manually, as often not everything
works correctly automatically-- sigh). He'll also say one of several sound
effects, often in a random combination-- a bird sound; "Thanks for the
power upgrade!"; "Let's join forces!"; a sound of his wings opening up;
and some other sounds from his non-powered up mode. (Most of the voiced
sound effects come straight from Peter Cullen, but a few seem slightly
"off". I don't know if I'm trying to pick apart the sounds too much or
if they got a Peter Cullen fill-in for a few of the phrases.) Unfortunately,
in a big departure from the other large electronic Power Surge toys, plugging
in other Power Surge Mini-Cons does NOT change any of the effects, and
some of them-- like Starscream's
        <a href="rid2powerstarscream.html">
         Lancelon
        </a>
        --
don't even fit into the hole properly! Why would you have this line-wide
gimmick and then not include it on the most expensive toy in the subline?!

        <font face="OCR A Extended">
         It's not that uncommon
for me to be a bit disappointed in a Transformer, but it's VERY rare for
a Transformer to actively make me ANGRY. This, unfortunately, is one of
those toys. Look, you want to make an electronic, simpler Optimus Prime
toy for the younger RID2015 audience that maybe makes some compromises
here and there for a more fun, playable toy? Have at it. But having a toy
where the vehicle mode is basically the truck front and then a bunch of
robot parts making up the rear 7/8ths of the vehicle, thin wing pieces
that fall off at the drop of a hat (and would ESPECIALLY annoy little kids),
add cheap ratchets that can break even when you're handling him carefully,
an auto-deploy gimmick that often doesn't fully work, and then include
NO cross-compatibility with the other Power Surge Mini-Cons on a $50 toy?
This toy is more likely to turn young kids OFF to Transformers than on
to them, and that's why it makes me mad; very few things work properly.
More effort (and more solid plastic) was definitely needed for this toy.
He's got good proportions and articulation in robot mode but beyond that
initial look in the box that's about it. Aerobolt is pretty... eh, but
he's not really a big part of this toy. Not recommended except for the
most hardcore Optimus completists.
