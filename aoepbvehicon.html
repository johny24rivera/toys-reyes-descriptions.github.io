    The rather simply-named
"Vehicon" is one of those vehicles that Cemetary Wind used that are on
super-high tires to track down Cade Yeager &amp; Prime through the corn
fields that "were so scary!". It's a pretty cool vehicle, and I'm glad
that it was able to make it into the toyline somehow, even as a fairly
rare-to-find tail-end release. In vehicle mode, for the most part Vehicon
is pretty spot-on with his proportions and detailing; the tires could stand
to be maybe a LITTLE bigger, but that's a small quibble. The main color
by far is black that has just a tinge of purple to it-- which not only
helps it fit in with how it looked in the movie, but helps tie it in thematically
with the violet visible in robot mode. There is some "regular" black too--
mostly on the wheels, in this mode, though it's also used for most of the
"core" of the robot mode parts. By itself, it's a pretty boring color,
though, so thank goodness for the silver-colored windows that give some
much-needed contrast to this mode. There's also some silver paint on the
winch on the front, as well as nice light metallic blue paint apps on the
headlights and red paint on the taillights. The silver "RALLY FIGHTER"
paint apps on the hood-- as well as the fake "Local Motors" logo on the
back end-- I question the use of, though. This is mainly because, in place
of those, more sensible paint apps on the wheel hubs or particularly on
the lights on the roof would have been appreciated much more. The mold
detailing in this mode is pretty minimal outside of the tires and a few
molded-in "spring" details around said tires, but then again that's pretty
accurate to the source material. The biggest downside about this mode is
the really obvious robot mode chainsaw-hand on the underside-- it REALLY
pokes out a lot, pretty much eliminating the large gap between the ground
and the bottom of the main vehicle body that this mode is supposed to have.
The non-chainsaw hand only sticks out slightly, and isn't nearly as much
of an issue. On a lesser note, there are little obvious square nubs on
the back end that clearly have to do with Vehicon's feet (they're his heels),
and the odd gap on the front side windows-- as opposed to having them being
solid plastic and painted silver like all the other windows on the toy--
looks out-of-place.

    To transform Vehicon
to robot mode, you simply fold out the sides, fold down the hood over the
robot head, and then rotate the waist and unfurl the legs, the toes 'n
such popping into place during the transformation. The end result is a
much more interesting mode color-wise than the vehicle mode, but unfortunately,
it has the same big issues, and that's a pretty good amount of vehicle
kibble. The sides of the vehicle mode hang behind the shoulders and arms
and are the biggest offenders, though there's also a section of the vehicle
that hangs behind Vehicon's butt and looks rather obnoxious. The windshield
piece also extends above Vehicon's back a bit unnecessarily high, as opposed
to just folding completely behind his back like you think it would-- though
this is for the gimmick. If you push in on the left shoulder first to make
sure the arm is "locked in place", folding down on the windshield on Vehicon's
back will make his entire left arm rotate upward at the shoulder, with
the lower arm rotating around in all directions and his chainsaw weapon
swinging around in a fast circle with it-- hence the "Chainsaw Thrash"
mentioned on the packaging. Fold back the chainsaw piece a little and a
rotary gun pops out above the wrist as well, which is a nice extra touch.
It's a pretty cool gimmick, though I wish the lever to activate it wasn't
so obvious. I DO love that you can simply "unplug" the gimmick by sliding
the left shoulder out again, so you don't have to automatically activate
it if you don't want to. Beyond the gimmick articulation, though, Vehicon
is very limited even for a Power Battler-- he can move forward at the right
elbow and rotate at the waist, and his toes can move slightly up and down.
That's it-- no real leg articulation at all, and I see no reason why his
head couldn't rotate, either. On the plus side, the mold detailing in considerably
more intricate and "movie-esque" in this mode, with pistons, angled armor
plates, vents, and the like all over the place. The headsculpt is particularly
awesome, with a mechanical "gas mask"-like mouth and a large green visor
with a bit of violet paint on the forehead. It makes Vehicon look like
he's wearing a helmet, which is appropriate for what I assume is meant
to be one of many of the same kind of 'bot-- i.e., a troop builder, even
though his placement in the last wave of the line makes actually troop
building him difficult. The paint apps on Vehicon in this mode also really
pop-- the metallic violet in particular on the lower arms and upper legs,
but the green and silver on the abs (and, of course, the silver on the
chainsaw) add to the existing vehicle paint apps to make sure that no one
area of Vehicon is too one-tone.

    The Power Battler Vehicon
has a great gimmick, a great look in some parts-- particularly in the vehicle
mode from several angles and the main body trunk and legs of the robot
mode-- and his paint apps in robot mode are really nice and help make him
look more interesting. He's also got a great headsculpt, but this is all
pulled down by some various obvious kibble in both modes, some of which
is a major eyesore. His articulation is also almost nonexistent. This is
the only toy of this vehicle from the movie released, so if you want it
it's pretty much this or nothing-- but though it has some awesome parts
to it, temper your expectations.
