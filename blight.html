    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Kickback. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Kickback

     Blight (COOL name!),
I think, is a decent repaint of Kickback-- an opinion that many other Transfans
don't seem to share, though I can't figure out why. I suppose what might
turn a lot of people off to Blight is the green-yellow, which, though I
have to admit doesn't look as good as Kickback's green, is by no means
gaudy. It's a perfectly fitting color for a tank, and it's not bright or
anything-- in fact, even though it's a light shade, it's a dull light shade.
(Don't know if that made any sense, but that's how it looks...) And the
black works REALLY well with it. The silver and purple also make great
accent colors, and the silver, purple, and black face looks loads better
than Kickback's odd orange-and-gray head. In fact, I think Blight looks
better than Kickback in robot mode, what with all the black, silver, and
purple paint apps. Though I don't think the tank mode measures up to Kickback's--
Blight doesn't have as many paint apps as his mold partner in this mode,
and he doesn't have any military-esque paint apps like the "B-12" on Kickback.
Just a few purple and silver paint apps. Oh, and the pastel blue paint
apps on the front look rather gaudy, too, but at least they're small. Plus,
the transparent blue weapon doesn't go as well with the yellow-green on
Blight as it did with the green on Kickback.

     Blight gets an unfairly
bad rap. Though I don't think he's quite as good as his mold brother Kickback,
he comes pretty close, and his robot mode looks great with all the paint
apps. Recommended.
