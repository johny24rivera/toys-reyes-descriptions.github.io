    Clocker's vehicle mode
is a speedy little convertible race-car-like... thing. Like many of the
Speed Planet futuristic alt modes, it doesn't fit in completely with one
type of Earth car completely. But regardless, Clocker's vehicle mode rocks
hard. Perfect proportions, for one. There's also some very nice mold detailing,
like the little vents on the side exhaust pipes to "let off more steam,"
little chairs molded behind the windshield, and generally all manner of
futuristic detailing. The color scheme-- white, silver, orange, and blue--
is unique, but yet it somehow fits together rather well. The only thing
I would've changed is making the orange parts that are covered in white
paint in this mode just a solid piece of white plastic, as the white doesn't
cover up the orange enough, since the orange is so much darker than the
white paint it actually shows through in some spots. But that's not that
big of a complaint, really. The transparent blue tires, windshield, and
headlights also look great, and contrast well with Clocker's otherwise-light
color scheme. And one of the best parts of this mode is that you can remove
a few parts if you feel they add to much to the bulk and the car-- the
side exhaust pipes and the top rear section behind the seats come right
off if you don't want them in this mode! As for Clocker's Key gimmick,
if you insert the Key into the rear of this mode, two little pieces on
the top flip out-- then, using your fingers, you can flip out little guns
to give Clocker some firepower in this mode! It looks rather cool, though
I am a bit dissapointed that the Key lifts up parts of the gun, only for
you to have to fold out the actual gun nozzles manually. Kinda takes away
form the whole "automatic" gimmick a bit.

    Clocker's robot mode
isn't quite as good as his vehicle mode, but it's still a very nice mode.
The articulation, for one, is very good-- he can move at the hed, shoulders,
elbows, waist, hisp, and knees, and some of these are on ball joints. Coupled
with his lack of a lot of back kibble and stable feet, you can get him
into a ton of cool poses. The only real restriction is that his shoulders
are molded in a kind of square shape, so the ball joint movement isn't
as free there as it otherwise would be. His elbow movement is also only
back-and-forth, not side-to-side. Another little downside to this mode
is that his gun, with the Cyber Key plugged into it, interferes with his
elbow movement. The gun itself also looks a little odd in this mode, as
it's a small square piece with the guns ABOVE it instead of to the sides
of the front of it. It looked fine and meshed well with the surrounding
area in vehicle mode, but sadly that's not the case in this mode. Some
upsides to this mode, however, are that the proportions are still spot-on
great, and the mold and paint detailing is very good for a basic. The head
molding is also pretty good, as it looks almost like Clocker has a "windshield"
on his forehead-- a nice touch. The bags under the eyes need to go, though--
it makes him look old, and he's supposed to be a little kid. The exhaust
pipes on the back of his hands are a bit big, but again, you can just take
them off if you don't like them-- not to mention he can hold then in his
hands like a gun if you want to use them that way. I also think it's rather
creative how the seats and side doors form his arms in robot mode without
managing to look odd- a very nice touch.

    Clocker is an excellent
basic, with only a few minor downsides. My personal favorite Scout-sized
toy of the first two Cybertron waves-- highly recommended.

      A young speedster with nerves of steel
and technique to spare. Quick-thinking, clever and courageous, his size
prevents him from presenting a real challenge on the track. He races out
of a sense of duty to his mentor Brakedown, and he knows every bit of road
on the Speed Planet like the back of his hand. It's his knowledge of the
Great Race that gives Hot Shot the edge he needs.
