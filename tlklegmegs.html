    Megatron's futuristic
jet vehicle mode is actually amazingly accurate to the movie model, all
things considered-- the size, simplicity, etc. Yes, there are extras--
the robot arms are rather obvious below what should be a very thin and
slim nosecone, and the feet are pretty obvious on the back, especially
painted as they are and with a noticeable gap in between them. Like many
Transformers with jet alt modes, there's a bit of an undercarriage here--
though again, considering the size, it's not bad at all beyond those arms
under the cockpit. Proportionally the jet mode is VERY accurate otherwise--
a very long body that's so skinny it's almost an extension of the nosecone;
a larger back end; even the wings are pretty spot-on, being fairly long
and skinny. The mold detailing is also impressive for the size, with little
panel lines and the like everywhere, along with important details such
as the ridged engine-like bits near the center, as well as the slanted
cockpit. Color-wise the toy is pretty dull, being almost all a dark gray,
but then again that's accurate to the movie model. The only paint in this
mode is some pale golden yellow on the cockpit and on the robot feet, as
well as a small silver Decepticon symbol on the left side of the nosecone.
Again, not much, but accurate to the movie.

    Megatron's transformation
is fairly straightforward, as you'd expect from a toy this small-- unfold
the legs out, flip the wings back, and then split the nosecone in half
and rotate them down to form the arms, with the top forming the cannon
on the right arm. Then open up the chest and fold out his head, re-closing
it again (though it can be a bit of a pain to get that head out-- you definitely
need fingernails). The end result is another pretty impressive mode for
the size-- even better than Megs' vehicle mode really. The only extras
are the wings on his back, but really at a Legion scale I don't see how
you could realistically get rid of his entire wings like in the movie model.
Everything else on his "core" robot mode is very proportional, with beefy
arms and legs. All of the major details are here, like the slightly asymmetrical
stripes on his shoulders and chest, more intricate detailing on his lower
arms, a "skirt" on his upper legs, and more pointed lower legs. Even keeping
his large cannon made up of his cockpit/nosecone piece is pretty nice.
His headsculpt is quite accurate, with a generally rounded head but with
a lot of "segments" to it, and with a wide, toothy maw. Beyond the paint
apps already talked about, there's some more pale gold on the middle of
his arms, a dab of red on his eyes, and then some dull brownish gray on
his lower jaw and the middle of his chest. He's actually a little MORE
colorful than he is in the movie, so I guess I can't complain as far as
accuracy goes, but man I do wish he had a bit more color-wise going on
here. I think the dark brownish gray used is so close to the dark gray
I wonder why it was even used, honestly. At least the gold provides some
good contrast. For articulation, Megatron can move at the shoulders, hips,
back at the knees, and his arm-cannon can also pivot in place-- very good
movement for a Legion toy, really, especially since it's almost all ball
joints.

    The Legion toy for TLK
Megatron is a good toy without even taking into account the small size--
yeah there's some minor undercarriage in the jet mode, and the wings are
right there in the robot mode, but both are very understandable given the
design. When actually taking into account the teeny size, these small downsides
become all the smaller. I wish he had a more interesting color scheme,
but that comes with the source material, not this toy. Great proportions
and detailing in both modes, fantastic robot articulation for the size.
One of the best small TLK toys out there.
