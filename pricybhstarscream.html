    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read
the review of the original Prime "Robots in Disguise" commander Starscream

     Unlike the

      deluxe
Beast Hunters Starscream figure
     </a>
     , the Cyberverse version isn't a new
mold, but in fact is a somewhat extensive remold of the original Cyberverse
Prime Starscream toy. Nearly all of the new details are meant to bring
this mode more "in sync" with his deluxe design, though; the main wings
are now more ridged, with the rear angled back and looking like feathers;
the robot mode chestplate has been changed and painted greenish gold to
closer match his deluxe toy; and his robot mode head has also been retooled
with the shark fin-like headcrest and gold ridges on the side of the face.
He also has a new weapon in the form of a large (proportionally) claw weapon
which is also a push-missile launcher and looks pretty cool, particularly
hanging underneath Starscream's jet mode like a capture claw (his new chest
has a Cyberverse weapon-compatible port in the middle of it for precisely
this reason). The one mold change that actually deviates substantially
in detail from his deluxe Beast Hunters toy is the front of the jet mode/lower
arm pieces; these actually look substantially more like a real jet cockpit
and nosecone, compared with the more abstract cockpit designs on both the
original version of this mold and the deluxe Beast Hunters version of Starscream.
I like this design better, as it keeps the toy a little more grounded in
reality while still keeping all the beastly detailing of the Beast Hunters
toys. What I really crow about when it comes to this toy, though, is the
color scheme. Of course, this is Starscream, so light gray is still a main
color, but it's a milky, semi-metallic shade that doesn't look that bad--
and all of Starscream's other colors look fantastic. The metallic gunmetal
works a nice compare/contrast dynamic with the lighter gray (though a regular
silver on Starscream's face would've looked better, methinks). The silver
works good for the cockpit windows, and the greenish metallic gold on Starscream's
chest, intakes, and wing-knees goes fantastically with all the red plastic,
which is just an eye-popping semi-metallic shade; heck, all of the colors
on this toy are metallic or semi-metallic in their shading! The end result
just looks great, and the larger proportion of red on this toy when compared
to the deluxe Beast Hunters version looks better than the higher proportion
of greenish-yellow on the latter.

Starscream, despite being a remold instead of an all-new design, actually
looks quite a bit better than the deluxe Beast Hunters toy (though admittedly
this is just as much because of the kibble problems of the deluxe toy as
it is the design additions to this version). The new detailing looks nice
overall, but the fantastic color scheme is pretty much the best Starscream's
ever had (that hasn't been an homage to one of the other Seekers). If you're
into the Beast Hunters re-designs of the main cast, I'd recommend picking
this up.
