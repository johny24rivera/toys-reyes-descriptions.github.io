       Shockwave is not just
the first, but the SECOND repaint of Armada Terradive to look almost exactly
like the original version of the mold. C'mon, we already get lazy repaints
for many of the store exclusives, now we have to deal with a few in the
main line, too? Shockwave does share a few differences from Armada Terradive,
but they are pretty minor-- namely, his gray is a bit darker, his purple
is of a duller shade, his black is more of an "off-black" and the chest,
cockpit, and arm paint apps have been changed a bit in their placement
and/or color. It's a good color scheme, but a very lazy repaint-- and Armada
Terradive carries off the same color scheme a little better, anyways. (On
a positive note, though, nice to see Hasbro has reacquired the Shockwave
name.)

         With the departure from Earth of the
Autobots and Decepticons, Shockwave and the Sky Attack Team found themselves
free to pursue their own interests. Shockwave has spent the last decade
hiding among the armed forces of dictators and tyrants around the world,
signing on with whoever is most likely to give him the opportunity to rain
fire down on helpless soldiers and civilians. There's nothing Shockwave
loves more than to see a huge column of oily black smoke rising from the
center of a populated area, and know that it was his bombs that lit the
fires.

           Tankor has a pretty appropriate
color scheme for a rough-'n-tough vehicle like a mobile missile launcher.
The dull orange and gray work pretty well together and, with the black
stripe paint apps added to the top of the vehicle mode, give Tankor a fairly
good "desert camo" feel. The onyl problem I have with him when it comes
to his color scheme is the white used in robot mode-- it doesn't fit in
with the "desert" look given to the rest of him and seems a little out
of place, though at least it doesn't outright clash with its surrounding
colors. The windows in his vehicle mode also need some paint apps to bring
them out more, though otherwise Tankor has a decent amount of paint apps.

side of the rear of his vehicle mode.

             After the Unicron Battles, many Mini-Con
chose to remain on Earth, in hiding and seperate from the ongoing conflict
between the Autobots and Decepticons. Tankor, with his teammates on the
Air Defense Team, hid among the armed forces of Earth so that they could
protect the humans from Shockwave and the Sky Attack Team. The desire to
protect human life is nearly an obsession for Tankor; he exists solely
to prevent the damage inflicted by Shockwave and his aerial companions.
The return of the Transformers to Earth has forced them once again to take
sides in a larger conflict.

             Shockwave vs. Tankor
is a rather cool Minicon set, IF you don't have any previous versions of
the Terradive mold. Shockwave is just way too similar to his predecessor
to justify the purchase if you have Terradive (unless you're a completist,
of course). Tankor has a pretty cool desert-ish color scheme, and I'd rate
him above the mold's color scheme as
