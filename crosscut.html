    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Skids. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Skids

     Crosscut here is an homage/update
to the Japanese e-HOBBY exclusive of the same name, which was a redeco
of the
     <a href="g1skids.html">
      original Skids
     </a>
     , so it's fitting that
Generations Crosscut is a redeco of Generations Skids. Crosscut's color
scheme-- by and large-- is pretty basic; black and light milky gray make
up a pretty significant majority of his coloration. They contrast against
each other well enough, I suppose, but the milky gray is of that really
blah color that I just wish was permanently replaced with more metallic
shades on TFs. There's a black stripe down the sides of the vehicle mode
doors and a bit on the rear and front bumpers to help shake things up a
little as well, but it's still a rather dull main color scheme. Luckily
there is SOME silver paint on places like his wheel hubs and the edges
of his windshield, but they're far and few in between. There's also some
dark transparent blue used for the windows-- and I rather like it, as it
not only gives some much-needed color to the vehicle mode, but it's dark
enough where you can't easily see the robot parts inside. What really helps
make the color scheme pop-- and, unfortunately, is only readily apparent
in robot mode-- is a really slick shade of metallic red that is just a
really eye-catching shade. Needless to say, it also goes well with the
rather neutral colors of gray and black. There's also a few paint apps
of yellow here and there, such as on the headlights, taillights, and missile
pack-shoulders.

     Crosscut has a new head
mold, which is pretty spot-on accurate to his e-HOBBY original version,
complete with a faceplate and a red "helmet" around his face. The sculpt
is quite well-done, and I actually like it slightly better than the already-good
Skids head sculpt. Otherwise, no mold changes have been made to this toy.

     Generations Crosscut
is a redeco that's likely only going to appeal to big-time collectors to
whom this rather obscure character means something to them. Not only is
Skids more well-known than him, but Crosscut's color scheme is pretty blah
and boring for the most part, particularly in vehicle mode where that really
nice cherry red isn't that visible. If his gray was painted silver, that'd
be a different story, but as-is, he's only recommended for obscure-character
collectors and completists; if you want one mainline release of this version,
his predecessor Skids is the easy recommendation.

       Crosscut isn't known for his accomplishments
in battle, but his role is no less valuable to the Autobot cause. The ambassador's
vast knowledge of languages and civilizations enables him to forge alliances
across the universe. The Autobots can establish footholds on other worlds
without firing a shot.
