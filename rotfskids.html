    Skids' vehicle mode is
a Chevrolet Spark, and is pretty darned accurate, overall. The proportions
are pretty much perfect, and the green color scheme is a bit unique for
a car and works well with him. The black stylized "skids" marks on his
sides that no doubt give his name help to break up the green a bit, though,
as does the black bit on his front. All of the NECESSARY details are there,
such as having transparent headlights, painted grills and tail-lights,
and the like, but his roof really could've used something, being devoid
of paint and nearly devoid of mold detailing. Some paint on the tires would've
been appreciated, too. His license plate, predictably, reads simply "SKIDS".
My main problem with this mode, however, has to do with being able to very
clearly see his robot parts inside the transparent blue plastic used for
the windows. This is one of those instances where either very dark translucent
plastic or just paint should've been used for the windows, as it rather
ruins the otherwise robot part-free alt mode. (If you look at Skids from
a direct-on side view, you can see the very tips of his hips and upper
arms poking down below the bottom rims of the car mode, but this is a minor
issue at best.)

    Skids' robot mode isn't
nearly as good as his vehicle mode, sadly, and has some MAJOR kibble issues.
Pretty much the entire top part of the car hangs off his back, and it doesn't
sit flush with his body below the waist, instead extending out down almost
to his feet. That's my biggest issue with this mode, as it really can impede
leg movement and just loooks bad. Skids also has most of his side panels
on his legs. They're wrapped around said legs near his feet, but seeing
as how his legs are pretty skinny, they still remain pretty unwieldy. On
the other hand, the rear wheel pieces on his shoulders add some bulk there,
and the car front works quite well as Skids' chest. His proportions are
another sore spot, with his legs being way too skinny and his head extending
a tad too much above his chest. I do like the uneven nature of his arms,
though, with one being a bit on the small side and one having an overly
large, bulky fist and lower arm piece. The mold detailing is fantastic,
and although it's something that definitely has to grow on you, I ended
up loving his head sculpt with the "tuft" of hair and the gold tooth. His
eyes could've been painted a bit better, however. The added jungle green
on his robot parts helps to contrast a little with his light green, though
generally two shades of green and gray just doesn't make for a very eye-catching
color scheme, though it's certainly not bad. (The jungle green that's visible
in robot mode is MUCH more palatable in person than it looks in these pics--
it's one of those colors that looks garish under camera light, for some
reason.) As far as articulation goes, Skids can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two places), at the wrist on his left arm,
and at the hips, knees (at four points), and ankles. Listing the legs implies
considerably more articulation that is actually possible, however, due
to the aforementioned roof-skirt hanging behind his legs and his having
small feet, which makes him rather off-balance particuarly given his back-heavyness.
Skids has two gimmicks-- pressing in on the center button on his chest
causes his head and chest panels to "pulsate" slightly, almost like he's
nodding his head to the beat of some music, which fits his character. In
addition, pressing in on the lever on his lower right arm causes his large
fist to shoot forward slightly while his lone gun on that arm pops up a
little for some shootin'. Both are pretty decent gimmicks.

    RotF Skids is another
of those movie designs that looks a lot better in concept than in reality.
Although his alt mode is great (except for the visible robot parts inside
his windows), his robot mode has some major vehicle mode kibble issues,
as well as some funky proportions (and in a way that isn't meant to be
funky-- granted, Skids being a comic relief character, IS a bit goofy in
his proportions on the CGI model). Althogh it's not too difficult to get
him from vehicle to robot, he's another RotF toy that's quite frustrating
to get everything to line up just right when transforming him back to vehicle
mode. He does have character, though, I'll give him that, and some pretty
decent gimmicks. Still, there's many better RotF designs out there, and
if you're only going to get one version of this character, I'd get the
more expensive Human Alliance version instead.

        In his vehicle mode,
Skids is a pretty good representation of the actual car in which is presented,
the Chevy Spark (Also called the Beat at one point I believe). Proportions
are spot on, and it rolls quite well when transformed correctly (more on
that later). With that said though, He is desperately in need of paint
apps. Compared to his larger Human Alliance counterpart, he just really
is lackluster. If anything, he could at least have the silver rim on his
tires like
        <a href="rotfmudflap.html">
         his brother's deluxe form
        </a>
        has.
Oh, and did I mention his headlights? Because those are quite nice looking
indeed. His tailights are just red painted plastic though, nothing fancy
(again, thats a different story on his HA form). Lastly, regarding to what
Beasty said about the light blue transparent windows, those don't really
bother me too much, but that is all a matter of preference.

        Quick transformation
note, turning him into robot mode isn't too hard, but getting him into
vehicle mode will spring quite a many curse words, so take your time and
make sure you know what you are doing, otherwise the car won't sit flat
on all four wheels. Robot mode for me is where he falls apart. Let me begin
with the good things, Beasty mentioned the backpack. Yes, it's there, yes
it's big. Personally, I don't mind it. For one, it's the twins "schtick".
And for two, it's at least more compact compared to his brother's. The
window hanging down behind his legs is the only thing that hinders articulation
and stability in this matter. Oh, there's a peg behind his neck that it
tabs into. Shave down the tab on the backpack a bit on either of the short
sides, so it doesnt push his head forward. Most people I know have already
done this, but if you are getting one MISB, you may need to do that as
it really does help. His sculpt really is good, and his gimmicks are nifty
while not getting in the way of the figure. Now, the bad things about him.
First, is a minor quibble, early releases of him did not have the gold
tooth painted, mine being one of those. This leads me to my second complaint,
he has a major lack of paint detailing on any part of him not seen in vehicle
mode. His legs and arms are BARE. Finally, the leg kibble as well as loose
knees really kills the stability of this figure, and can make him very
hard to pose.

       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Overall, I would get
this guy only if you are short of cash yet really want a Skids. Otherwise,
pass him up and spring for the Human Alliance version or the Tuner Skids
repaint instead.

           Because he is slightly less hyperactive
than his brother Mudflap, Autobot Skids has always thought of himself as
"the smart one." He likes to point this out at every opportunity. While
Mudflap zips around like a maniac, Autobot Skids prefers to impress his
superiors among the Autobot high command by behaving in a way he thinks
of as mature, which usually involves talking nonstop about anything that
occurs to him.
