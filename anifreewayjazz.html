    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated deluxe
Jazz. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     The debate rages (well,
sorta)-- is Freeway Jazz a repaint homage to

     ?

     ? Some
other character? Or is it an homage to nothing at all, but there's just
so many sportscars TFs he's bound to resemble someone with his paint job?
Regardless, the repaint of Jazz just oozes smooth. Normally I'm not a fan
of primarily monochrome TFs, but Freeway Jazz pulls it off exceedingly
well. His black parts are pretty much the same, but his white has been
replaced with a VERY nice-looking dull gray color. It's not the same milky
gray color used on so many other TFs-- this one almost looks painted, as
opposed to being blatantly plastic. Some light gray, gunmetal, and silver
highlights add to the monochrome-ness of the scheme. There is a little
color to Freeway Jazz, though-- his visor is the same blue it's always
been, his wheels are bronze, his headlights are a nice transparent amber
color, and a few paint apps are light red. If all comes together to look
rather realistic without missing the "cool" look of Jazz.

     Freeway Jazz is a repaint
that fits the character extraordinarily well, and also does the "monochrome
color scheme" thing stupendously, with there being several different "levels"
of gray/black to keep things visually interesting while using a nice semi-shiny
dull gray color. The bits of bronze/amber and light red help to add a little
color and keep him from being completely monochrome, though. Recommended
over the original Animated Jazz toy.

       With Decepticon activity at its peak
near the galactic rim, rumors begin to circulate that Earth may be getting
more evil visitors as well. In anticipation of incoming Decepticons, Autobot
Jazz goes undercover, immersing himself in Earth culture. From where he
hides in plain sight, he can enjoy the sights and sounds of Earth while
planning the perfect moment to strike.
