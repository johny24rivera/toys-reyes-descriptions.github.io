not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Masterpiece

     Boy, I never thought
I'd see a Shattered Glass toy outside of Botcon, yet here we are! As to
be expected, Masterpiece SG Optimus takes its cues from the original
     <a href="bcprime.html">
      Botcon
2008
     </a>
     toy; that is, he's not quite Nemesis Prime, but more of an Optimus
Prime with the red replaced with purple and under some very "dark" lighting.
For this Masterpiece version, the colors are appropriately very shiny.
The purple-- used mostly for the cab and the upper body of the robot mode--
is milky AND with some glitter in it, and just looks stupendous as a color.
For most of the gray-- used on his grill, upper legs, gun, some minor pieces,
the trailer stand, and much of the remote drone on his base-- it's also
this same milky/glittery color, which actually makes gray plastic look
pretty good for once! A very dark blue is used on his head, hands, lower
legs, and most of the REST of his base's remote drone, and also has this
same awesome milky/metallic sheen to it. All in all, these colors are definitely
Masterpiece-worthy. There's also quite a lot of black, used almost entirely
for the trailer-- and of course it's quite fitting for an evil Autobot.
As opposed to a shade of blue, SG Prime's translucent parts are mostly
a transparent green, like the faux headlights on his waist, his axe accessory,
and the cockpit of his trailer drone. This is a REALLY nice shade that
looks like a sour apple lollipop, if I'm to be honest. Oddly, the transparent
plastic used for his main truck windows is more of a yellowish-green shade--
I would have appreciated a bit more consistency, but it's still "good enough".
Of course Prime has a good number of silver paint apps, like on the sides
of his truck mode, his lower legs, and on his faceplate; metallic light
green on his headlights; metallic dark purple paint on the stripes on his
trailer; red on his eyes; and a bit of metallic gold on his forehead crest.
All in all his robot mode has a GREAT color scheme, and really helps nail
that "evil Prime" feel. However, the damage paint apps which are so prevalent
on the Botcon 2008 toy are very lacking here; he's got a "ding" in one
of his windows, and in small print on one side it says his catchphrae "Till
All Are Gone!", but that's about it. It's a shame, because given how large
of a toy he is there's a LOT of room for silver or white "scrape" paint
apps. The trailer is almost all a solid black and also really suffers from
not having enough paint apps.

     No mold changes have
been made to MP Shattered Glass Optimus Prime, though unfortunately the
"Roller" drone has been removed from the toy.

     Masterpiece Shattered
Glass Optimus Prime is a toy I never thought I'd see, but man is it appreciated.
It's nice to see this great Botcon evil Prime color scheme applied to pretty
much the greatest Transformer mold of all time, and the vast majority of
the colors are really nice shades that pop extremely well. That said, the
almost complete lack of "damage" paint apps is a definite oversight-- the
redeco needed to be a bit more wacky. To get him up to a solid 10, I'd
recommend the

labels,
     </a>
     which really add back the wackiness and "Hannibal Lector"-esque
feel to the toy. (They're MORE than worth the price, trust me.)

       In the Shattered Glass universe, Cybertron
is a dark and different place. Once just a simple librarian named Optronix,
the deranged and dangerous warrior now known as Optimus Prime plotted and
schemed his way to power on Cybertron, forming a loyal and lethal band
of followers known as the Autobots.
