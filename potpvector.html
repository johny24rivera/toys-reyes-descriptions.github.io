    As is the case with the
other Prime Master figures, Vector Prime-- the "inner Prime Master" for
this set-- doesn't look a thing like
    <a href="vectorprime.html">
     he traditionally
has
    </a>
    . Rather, he's got a fairly nondescript robot mode for his Prime
Master's robot mode. He's got your typical Titan/Prime Master proportions,
with typical fist details on the hands, skinnier leg details on the lower
legs, a vent and some ridges on his waist and upper legs, and a couple
of squares on his chest. His head is also pretty average, having a very
average "curved helmet with two side antennae" helmet and a "normal" face
with two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The color scheme in this mode is dark
gray on the body and legs, with dark blue on the arms and a titch of silver
paint on the face. The silver goes quite well against the dark blue, but
otherwise this color scheme is a bit too dark, and could have used another
paint app or two. As with all Prime/Titan Masters, Vector Prime can move
at the neck, arms (at the shoulders), hips, and knees in this mode (with
the latter two each as one point, since both of his legs are molded together).
His alternate mode is a "Prime Core", essentially symbolizing the embuing
of Vector Prime's powers to whoever's wielding the Prime Armor he's slotted
into in this mode. This design's rather inspired, with a dark blue ridged
circle around the edges, compete with four "claw" triangles coing in at
each corner-- sort of like a compass, and also hearkening back to the original
Vector Prime's stomach design. In the middle is Vector Prime's "symbol",
a circle in which three dots are connected to each other, sort of like
a constellation. It stands for Vector's mastery over space/time, with him
"teleporting" to various places instantaneously. (The "constellation" portion
can, of course, bring to mind "space" as well.) The symbol itself is painted
a nice light metallic silvery blue, with both contrasts and complements
the dark blue of the rest of the front quite well.

    Vector Prime can fit
inside the "Pretender armor" that comes with him to form the full set,
and this Pretender armor is an homage to G1 Metalhawk. As a whole, Metalhawk
doesn't look all that unique for a Pretender in G1, having another "human
in armor" look to him. However, for this version-- what with the human
face removed and all-- you can see the inner Prime Master's face through
the space in the helmet instead. The front portion of this mode is pretty
well-decorated, with several intricate details on the main body including
a shark-fin-like helmet, litlte yellow bits that come in on the sides of
his fairly dark red chest, red abs, silver "teeth-like" details on the
sides of the abs, a blue armored waistplate, and large polygonal silver
kneecaps. What isn't painted on the front of this mode is dark blue. When
looked at from a side view, you can see that most of the rest of this mode
beyond the front is dark gray-- not exactly the most eye-catching color.
In spite of the silver and yellow paint apps, that's my biggest issue with
this toy's color scheme-- both of the main colors are dark, so beyond the
chest and upper legs Vector Prime/Metalhawk's a bit too dark. Either the
blue or gray should have been lightened up some, methinks. Metalhawk's
got some fairly generic robotic detalils on his arms and the rest of his
body beyond the front, and like all Prime Master "exosuits", he can move
back-and-forth at the shoulders, but that's it as far as articulation goes.
For a weapon accessory, Metalhawk comes with a long single-barreled gun
in this mode that can be held in either his hands or clipped onto his back
if you want it out of the way. I like the addition of all that silver paint,
though holding it in his hands, it's kind of ridiculously large proportionally
for Metalhawk. As with all Prime Masters, to use the Pretender's "weapon
mode", you just fold out the weapon portion from the upper back, flip out
a small peg between the feet so a larger Transformer can hold the toy,
and then-- if you want-- attach the Prime Master in Core Mode onto the
top back to serve as a sort of "power source" for the weapon. Of course,
with such a simplistic transformation, it means you've got obvious arms
on the sides and the entire Pretender shell front on the bottom of this
mode, though the overall silhouette isn't too bad. Obviously, given the
handheld weapon, this forms a long single-barreled gun in this mode for
larger TFs to wield. It's okay, but not particularly unique, and the dark
gray plastic that dominates the body of this mode is kinda boring, too.

    Vector Prime/Metalhawk
has a few things going for him-- a well-painted, well-detailed front of
his Pretender mode, and a really unique and awesome symbol for his Core
mode-- but other than that he's slightly below average for a Prime Master
set. (Not that that means a whole lot, given how similar all the Prime
Master sets are structurally.) He needed more light colors (particularly
in weapon mode and Vector Prime's individual modes), and although his gun's
a solid weapon, it's not particularly unique. Plus, though it looks alright,
the Pretender shell isn't particularly unique, given it's another "guy
in a suit" Pretender.
