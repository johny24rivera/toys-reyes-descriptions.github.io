    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War
Within Optimus Prime

     Optimus Prime gets repainted
in Optimus Prime colors as... Optimus Prime! Wow, what an amazing redeco!
All kidding aside, although he still shares the basic color scheme as this
mold's original deco, the colors are mixed around and used in amounts more
akin to Movie Prime's color scheme (sans the flames). That is, there's
considerably more blue and a bit less red, with some more gray creeping
in. The paint scheme does an exceptional job of mixing all this up so that
no part of this version of Prime's deco job gets too boring, however. Using
some nice silver, black, and dull gold paint apps here and there-- particularly
on the waist, the shoulders, and the front of the lower legs-- really helps
to achieve this. Heck, with the silver and gold Optimus Prime looks almost
royal in places, given the inherent glossy-ness of paint over Prime's many
diecast metal parts. The actual plastic gray-- mostly used for connector
parts-- is pretty dull, but given hwo little it's used overall this is
a fairly minor quibble. Especially when you consider that, unlike the original,
this guy's paint isn't sloppy and doesn't chip!

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Prime, so unfortunately he still suffers from
the loose, dangly joints that plague this mold. Also, he doesn't come with
a stand like most other 6" Titaniums.

Optimus Prime has a great deco job-- the best that this mold's gotten,
in my opinion, with the accent colors of gold, black, and silver really
helping to make Prime's base colors stand out. A shame about the inherent
looseness of the mold's joints, and when you consider the lack of a stand
and the $5 U.S. price jump, it makes me a bit more hesitant to recommend
him even though he has the superior color scheme. Still, if you don't mind
the slightly increased price and really want this mold, this guy's your
one to look out for.

       From the fires of a war that laid waste
to their planet, to the final battle on their adopted home world, Optimus
Prime has led the Autobots. For millions of years, he has stood like an
unmovable pillar, even as chaos consumed all around him. He is more than
a mere leader to his fellow AutobotsÂ—he is a symbol of all they stand for.
He is justice, peace, and compassion personified. While he lives, the Autobots
will never fail, never falter, and never give up.
