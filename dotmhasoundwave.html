      This version of DotM
Laserbeak keeps his bird mode more or less the same, with excellent proportions
and detailing (particularly on his midsection and turbine-wings). Other
than a missile sticking out his back end, Laserbeak doesn't have any extras
in his beast mode; this is clearly what this small toy was primarily made
for. The only details that don't seem quite "right" here are on his head--
his little beak-like nodules are a bit oversized to the point where they
look like a weird mustache. He's got a decent amount of paint detailing,
with a really nice dark red metallic spray app on each of his wings, along
with blue eyes, light red turbines, and a few parts along his back painted
black so that there's no large unbroken bit of dark gray. That said, I'm
not fond of the light red plastic used for his legs-- it's just a bit TOO
light, and seems out-of-place with his otherwise fairly dull color scheme.
For articulation, Laserbeak can move at the base of each wing and at the
hips; both are on ball joints and can get a good range of motion, however.
It's not a whole lot of movement, but hey, this version's rather tiny,
something's gotta give. I do find it a bit oversight that there's no steady
place for Laserbeak to peg in and "perch" on Soundwave in the latter's
vehicle mode, though.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Laserbeak's transformation
simply consists of flipping his (spring-loaded) missile launcher out from
underneath his body and then folding up his wings and legs-- but for an
accessory, this is fairly decent. It fits over Soundwave's shoulder and
pegs into place nicely enough, with the "Laserbeak stuff" mostly out of
the way and out of sight behind the shoulder. Only the beast head is a
particular eyesore in this mode. There's also two small pegs for Mr. Gould
or another Human Alliance human figurine to stand on and "man" Laserbeak
in this mode, to give him a little extra play value.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      For what basically amounts
to a little "Targetmaster", Laserbeak is pretty decent. He's got some nice
paint apps and proportions in beast mode (even if his articulation is a
bit sparse), and his gun mode-- while having an obvious big backpack formed
from his bird parts-- manages to hide most of it surprisingly effectively
and works with both Mr. Gould and Soundwave, to boot. This certainly shouldn't
be the REASON you're getting this set, but for what he does, he does fairly
well.

        Soundwave's vehicle mode
is a Mercedes SLS sportscar, and has some pretty slick proportions that
are spot-on with the actual vehicle-- which is, of course, expected at
this scale for licensed vehicle modes. All the necessary mold detailing--
vents, lines, wheel axles, 'n such-- are here, but little more, which is
fine given the sleek nature of the vehicle. Other than a few small dark
blue flaps if you look at Soundwave from the back end, he has no robot
mode extras at all in this mode-- and even the aforementioned flaps are
really minor even if you're looking right at them. The paint detailing
here is mostly limited to his lights, grills, and covering up the transparent
portions of the doors. The light red taillights are a nice touch, as is
Soundwave's license plate-- a throwback to part of one of his famous catchphrases,
"SUPERIOR" as in "Soundwave Superior, ______ Inferior". Unfortunately his
primary color is a pretty dull-looking shade of light milky gray-- at this
pricepoint, I really would've preferred some metallic or semi-metallic
paint over practically the whole body of the car, like what's used on his
car doors. Both of Soundwave's doors open up vertically, just like on the
actual car, and you can place two Human Alliance human figurines in inside,
who fit in a bit snugly. The Mr. Gould figurine is a decent enough interpretation
of the DotM character in mini-plastic form, but with enough liberties taken
so they probably didn't have to pay the actor to make it. Mr. Gould is
your standard Human Alliance figurine, with the usual articulation and
holes in his feet and upper back to allow him to interact with larger figures
in the subline.

       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Soundwave's transformation
to robot mode is a bit tricky-- particularly the first few times-- but
not much moreso than most other $30-sized figures in the subline. Soundwave's
robot mode looks pretty excellent-- from the waist up. He's got a very
nicely-proportioned chest with a fragmented front grill, a DYNAMITE headsculpt
with a red visor painted to look like it's absolutely blaring red, and
nice, beefy shoulders and arms. His hands are three-fingered, with the
thumbs not being able to get close enough to give him a fist capable of
holding anything, but at least it LOOKS cool. There is a fair bit of car
kibble on his back-- his doors, roof, and front hood, to be specific. The
front hood and roof stay out of the way and behind his back, thus being
a minimal eyesore at worst, but his car doors... not so much. I hate how
much they just "hang off" his shoulders with no real set place for them,
though at least they add some visual bulk, there. Two of his wheels are
on his shoulders as is his movie design-- though again, I wish they tabbed
or locked into place somewhere. His light blue electric "sound weapons"
on his forearms look great and help to give Soundwave a bit more individuality,
though the large Decepticon symbols painted on two of them are a tad obnoxiously
large and definitely not in the best place. His robot mode parts have a
ton of mold detailing on them, as you'd expect from a movie toy, with angular
ridges everywhere. The addition of dark blue and black really helps to
break up this mode visually in terms of color and is much appreciated.
The gold and light blue accents on the chest, waist, and forearms serve
as nice contrast colors, as well. Soundwave's legs are where, visually,
he falls apart-- they're undersized skinny little sticks of legs that,
when collapsed, form ONLY the part of the car behind the rear windshield,
just to show you how comparatively little mass they consist of. He has
his three toes splayed out in a manner that makes him quite stable despite
this, but this makes his proportions off and really gorilla-like, which
is most definitely NOT what he looked like in the movie. For articulation,
Soundwave can move at the neck (side-to-side, as well as up a little),
and at the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), at the base
of each thumb and at the base of the two fingers on each hand (they both
move as one piece); he can also move at the hips (at three points), knees
(at three points, though they're at rather odd angles due to his transformation),
ankles, and at the base of each toe. His mouth can also move up and down
(well, more accurately the rest of his head EXCEPT his lower jaw moves
up and down, but it has the same effect). His shoulders are a bit restricted
because of all the kibble there, but with the exception of waist movement,
he's doing pretty well in this department, particularly given how stable
his feet are.

        Human Alliance Soundwave
&amp; Laserbeak is a pretty decent set, for the most part. I DESPISE Soundwave's
puny lower legs, and that by itself makes up 90% of my quibbles with this
figure (the rest mainly being his dull coloration in vehicle mode and all
his kibble around the shoulders). However, those problems aside, this is
a rather neat mold, with quite a lot of posability and play value. Mildly
recommended, given that his U.S. release was sadly cancelled and he was
only ever released overseas (hence you'll have to pay a markup for him).
If it weren't for his legs it'd be a full-blown recommendation, but alas...
