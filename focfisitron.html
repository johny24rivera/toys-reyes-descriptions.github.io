not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Swindle.

     "Fisitron" is another
version of Ironfist. Admittedly FunPub has already done this character
as a
     <a href="bcanifisitron.html">
      BotCon 2011 exclusive
     </a>
     , but that version
was in the Animated style and had more saturated colors-- this version
is closer to the "traditional" Transformer style and color-wise is MUCH
closer to his original toy. (Plus, the original Ironfist's alternate mode
was a jeep, so using FoC Swindle's mold makes sense if you're going for
a Cybertronian version of him.) Fisitron's main two colors are a creamy
tan and a rather dark shade of perwinkle (the latter much more apparent
in robot mode). These two colors contrast against each other EXCEEDINGLY
well, and both just look good even by themselves. It's actually a rather
realistic color scheme for a character from the early '90s. Without the
chest there's a bit too much unbroken periwinkle on the upper body in robot
mode-- nearly everything from the knees up-- but, thankfully, there IS
that big chest flap to help vary the colors-- though it may not help much
from a back angle... Fisitron also has some light brownish gray plastic
used for both his wheels and his combiner hands, and it's honestly an ugly
shade of the color that looks a little "dirty" but not enough to actually
look like dirt's on the wheels. Thankfully, it's not used much. There's
some silver on the engine pistons on the front, the tailpipes, and the
wheel hubs, though the silver is so close to the brownish gray it doesn't
stick out enough, especially for a FoC toy, if you ask me. The addition
of some light orange on the kneecaps and some seafoam green on the lower
legs both contrast quite well with the tan and hearken back to his original
toy as well, and help to vary up Fisitron's colors more. There is just
a LITTLE bit of that early '90s color madness in Fisitron's color scheme,
with his headlights being pink (again accurate to the original toy).

     Fisitron has the

     head, but not the FoC Roadbuster weapon, unfortunately.
Thankfully, Fisitron's head is painted quite nicely, with a silver faceplate
and metallic silvery blue eyes, though the mouth "gas mask" area does look
a bit too bulky/"mean" compared to Fisitron's original toy, which had a
more straightforward faceplate.

     FoC Fisitron is a nice
"normal" update of the character, and mildly recommended if you liked the
character in the IDW comics. His colors are top-notch (light brownish gray
excepted), and contrast and complement each other very nicely. That said,
the mold is rather medicore, which does dampen my enthusiasm a bit-- but
hey, if you like the character or want another character compatible with
the mass-retail FoC Wreckers, here you go.

       Ironfist was an assembly line worker
in the factories of Polyhex, known only for a modest and agreeable personality
that brought people together around him. None would have suspected that
his profession was a front for his true passion as an underground weapon
designer, for which he was known across the infosphere by the alias "Fisitron".
When Ultra Magnus appeared at the factory one day and asked for him by
name, Ironfist immediately thought that his illegal hobby had gotten him
arrested, but the truth was even stranger: Unknown to him, a routine physical
examination had shown the origins of his mechanical genius to be a "combination
spark"-- a rare genetic mutation giving him the potential to innately bond
and interface with other machines. Welcomed by Magnus as a new member of
the Wreckers, the days of "Fisitron" having to conceal his true nature
are long past, as he proudly discovers new ways to lend his ever-growing
abilities to the Autobot war effort.
