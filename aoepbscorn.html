    One thing about Scorn's
wacked-out spinosaurus mode when compared to his
    <a href="scorn.html">
     "Generations"
deluxe version
    </a>
    is that this one is actually more accurate to the movie
model. Whereas the deluxe had a more traditional spine-fin along the back,
this one has more accurate separate, long spikes (made of rubbery plastic
for safety purposes, of course). Granted, there should be more rows of
them, and they should be longer, but because of the transformation this
might not be practical. Overall the proportions are quite good in this
mode- there really aren't any robot mode bits to speak of, which is always
good. (The pointy robot "knight" feet on the back end of the dino feet
are technically extras, but they blend in so well as heels I don't really
count them. They also help keep Scorn considerably more stable in this
mode.) There's plenty of excellent mold detailing in this mode, with spike
or spike-like protrusions everywhere and what looks like a more movie-accurate
dino head when compared to his deluxe version. There's also a really nice
segmented-and-spiky tail section (again, made out of rubbery plastic),
and the fake teeth on the upper legs (for robot mode accuracy's sake) also
look pretty good. The overall color scheme is pretty basic, being mostly
a fiery red and light milky gray. Unfortunately, the shade of light gray
is exactly that really boring blah shade that I wish Hasbro would quit
using and instead use a more metallic shade. There's a bit of black on
the feet and dino head, light blue paint on the eyes, and a bit of silver
on the top of his spines. Unfortunately there isn't any of that orange
like on the deluxe, which really would've helped spice things up a bit
in this mode-- it's not a BAD color scheme, just a bit dull, particularly
given the shade of gray. Most of the paint apps are also focused on the
dino head, the spines, or the lower legs, which means that his body and
tail are very much two-tone and need a bit more variety. Also of note is
that the light red paint used on Scorn is just noticeably lighter than
the red plastic, though just slightly-- you likely won't notice upon a
first glance. For articulation in this mode, Scorn can move up-and-down
at one section at the tail, back-and-forth at the hips, knee rotation,
and downwards movement at the neck. I really wish some dino arm articulation
or at least jaw movement would have been added, but otherwise it's adequate.

    The transformation is
pretty simple, even for a Power Battler-- you just split apart the head
and fold them down the sides to become the robot arms, fold up the dino
arms on the shoulders, and then straighten out the legs. Scorn's proportions
for the main body and legs are quite good in this mode, though the legs
could stand to be just a TITCH longer. The arms are where this mode suffers,
with the dino and neck-halves not being thick enough to really work as
arms, not to mention how movie-inaccurate they are (with the hands just
merely molded into the inside of the dino head-halves). (This is another
reason Scorn REALLY should have had jaw articulation-- so his hand-claws
could open and close in this mode.) Other than that, the dino mode kibble
folds away pretty well-- the dino arms work nicely folded against the shoulders,
and the spines and tail are behind Scorn's back and out of the way. The
mold detailing on the robot parts is also extremely well-done and surprisingly
intricate, with "abs" and various armor plating-like detailing on the main
body, and a hip "skirt" and feet also very well-sculpted. There's also
some silver on the faceplate and sides of the main body, with some orange
on the main body as well, all of which helps to break up Scorn's color
scheme and make it more attractive than it was in beast mode. (The orange
is a bit duller than I'd like, though.) Scorn's Power Battler gimmick is
an odd one-- rotate the right shoulder forward and the middle section of
his entire body will actually fold all the way around, allowing for the
"tail whip" gimmick advertised on his packaging, with his tail swinging
forward in front of his body rather abruptly. What's especially odd about
this is that there's an entirely
    <i>
     new
    </i>
    front and head for Scorn when
his tail is deployed in the front (it's on the back normally). It's almost
identical to the one seen when his tail isn't deployed, but his visor is
blue as opposed to black for this version, and his faceplate is black instead
of silver and a bit more angular and mouth-like. I rather like this head
design better, even if it isn't movie-accurate. Simply flip the tail back
to put Scorn back into his "normal" robot mode. What's great about this
is that if you don't want Scorn's tail swinging loosely behind his back
when it's not deployed you can simply closeup the dino back halves, and
it's just as secure then as it is in dino mode (that is, very). On the
negative side, the shoulder method of deploying the tail whip often doesn't
work, so I usually just manually do it. For articulation in this mode,
Scorn can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
hips, rotation at the knees, and at three points on his tail when it's
deployed-- not spectacular, but a little above-average for a Power Battler.

    Power Battler Scorn
is the only "simplfied" toy for him in the AoE line, with no 1-step changer
being released for him. As such, if you want a simpler-to-transform toy
of the character, this is really your only option. Luckily, this is one
of the best Power Battler molds overall, with minimal kibble in both modes,
good proportions, excellent mold detailing, and fair paint detailing (he
could use some more in beast mode). His tail gimmick is rather odd-- particularly
in that it gives him two completely different robot chests and heads--
but if you don't like it, just keep the back closed in robot mode and you
never have to give it a second thought.
