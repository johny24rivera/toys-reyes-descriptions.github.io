    Velocirazor's alt mode
is a disc or sawblade-- all the initial Autobot Mini-Cons are supposed
to be discs, but the combination of this guy's name and the edged directional
little bits sticking out the sides of the disc mode make it look more like
a sawblade. It looks pretty cool and better than most of the disc modes,
though the bottom left portion is a bit telling, as it's noticeably skinnier
for a bit and it's flat at the bottom; that's where Velocirazor's feet
are. On a (much) lesser note, a section of the upper right hand portion
is hollow on the side because that's where the arms are and there has to
be a gap in between said arms, but that's being reallllly picky. Look-wise,
this is pretty solid, with more sawblade-like detailing around the center
and quite a few robotic details. Unfortunately, as is the norm with Mini-Cons,
there's no paint at all in this mode. Velocirazor is completely a milky
aquamarine color, which is a pretty nice shade, though I wish it was just
a touch darker. Presumably because the milky aquamarine couldn't be used
for completely unyielding plastic gears very well, a few minor connection
pieces-- only really visible on part of the sides of this mode-- are a
slightly lighter pale shade of aquamarine. It's a bit of a mismatch, but
not a huge deal given how little it's used.

    To transform Velocirazor,
you take the top portion and rotate it out to the left, while the tail
automatically folds out from the bottom of the disc to the right, and there
you have Velocirazor's velociraptor mode. Of course, given that he's a
disc, it's a bit 2-D-- when looked at from a front view, he's definitely
a bit too skinny, but I don't really see how this is avoidable given the
pricepoint and auto-transform gimmick. From the recommended view-- the
side view-- this mode looks pretty decent, with some really nice intricate
detailing on the raptor head (though I'm not sure what the horns are about--
I'm not aware of raptors with horns, but I could be wrong). The only paint
detailing on the toy is on said head, with yellow eyes and silver horns.
He's also got two small raptor arms, and a long curved tail. Proportionally,
the body is about right, but it's a bit too "low"-- a bit saggy-- which
makes Velocirazor look just a tad fat. If a bit of the mass from the bottom
had been placed near the top, the body would be just about perfect. Because
the body is a bit "bottom-heavy", Velocirazor has almost non-existent legs,
with it going almost directly from his body to his feet, complete with
a molded-in large claw on the end of each foot. From a top view, Velocirazor's
back is just a tad weak as you can see all the gears in there, but that's
a minor downside. For articulation, you can rotate up the main body with
the tail automatically rotating down slightly if you want to begin the
transformation back into disc mode without completing it, but except for
that movement that's a side effect of the auto-transform gimmick, he has
no articulation. Velocirazor's armor bits are a transparent red, which
looks great and contrasts excellently with the aquamarine-- it ALMOST makes
up for the lack of paint apps when it's on. Almost. All of his armor bits
are focused towards the front of this mode. He's got a really nice "muzzle-like"
piece that goes over the front of the head, small guns that are on his
shoulders, and MORE guns that go on the side of each foot, so he's got
plenty of firepower. He's also got two more asymmetrical pieces that fit
on the sides of his body-- on the left side, he's got a fairly large blade
piece that sticks out the front, while on the right side, he's got another
gun that connects to the body with a needlessly large segment that definitely
becomes the rear fin of the Wave 2 "bonus figure" and looks a bit odd here
without being part of said bonus figure. That last piece also falls off
kinda easily, so I'm not fond of that. The rest look great, though. In
disc mode, everything can fit except for the muzzle piece, unfortunately.

    Velocirazor is one of
the better Autobot disc Mini-Cons, with a a very solid disc mode and a
pretty good velociraptor mode as well. He's got some minor proportional
issues-- mostly with the feet and lower body-- and like most Mini-Cons,
he has very little paint and almost no articulation. His armor pieces (with
the exception of the shark fin-piece) are pretty cool too, though I think
not being able to have the muzzle piece on in disc mode was an oversight.
Still, overall, he's a great unique soldier for your Mini-Con army.
