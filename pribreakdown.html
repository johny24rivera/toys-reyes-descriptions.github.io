    Given how often he goes
toe-to-toe with Bulkhead in the show, you'd think that Breakdown's Cyberverse
toy was a commander-class toy like the
    <a href="pricybulkhead.html">
     former
    </a>
    ,
but unfortunately the big guy is represented as a tiny Legion-class toy.
Still, size aside, Breakdown's vehicle mode looks quite accurate to the
show, being a dark blue (very) heavy duty vehicle. Beyond the back bumper
looking a bit too obviously like the bottoms of his feet, he doesn't have
any robot mode extras in this mode, either; proportionally, his only issue
is that his windows/drivers' area is a bit too small vertically when compared
to the rest of the vehicle, but only just so-- his proportions in vehicle
mode are exaggerated a bit on the show model, as well. A nice shade of
dark blue is used for his main color, having a glossy, almost semi-metallic
finish. However, that said, I would've liked a more dominant light color
here. There's a decent amount of black on his wheels and tires, but the
only light color here is the silver on his front bumper and grill (which
are detailed excellently). His rear bumper could've also used some silver
paint, as well as some of the rails molded onto the top of this mode to
give it a bit more visual pop. For a weapon, Breakdown comes with a weapon
that apes his vehicle cannon, though it's the same translucent pale light
purple as the other Prime Decepticon legion toys from 2012. The weapon
is a bit large proportionally when compared to the vehicle mode, but it
does scale well with other Cyberverse weapons, and can be held in two different
ports in this mode-- both of them behind the front window on the roof,
on opposite ends.

    Breakdown's robot mode--
as is typical of a Legion-class toy-- suffers the most out of the two modes
when it comes to show accuracy. Breakdown's legs are fairly well-proportioned
compared to his show model, and his chest is more or less okay, if a bit
overly encumbered with large hinges because of the transformation. However,
Breakdown's arms are where this mode becomes sub-par. Even given Breakdown's
"beefy guy" proportions, his shoulders and arms are overly large and long.
They're also articulated oddly, making it difficult for him to pose said
arms and have it look natural. Speaking of articulation, Breakdown can
move at the shoulders (at two points), side-to-side at the elbows, and
at the hips. His knees can technically move, but only at an unnatural forward
point because of the transformation. I REALLY wish Breakdown could move
forwards at the elbows, but otherwise he's decent enough for the size class
in this respect. Breakdown's colors are thankfully broken up a bit more
in this mode with a bit more silver (such as on his shoulders and waist).
His face sculpt is also well-done and detailed excellently, with his red-orange
face, silver head crest, and yellow eyes all picked out cleanly even at
this small scale. His other (more angular) details on his shoulders and
legs are well-sculpted too, though his hands that are molded into the sections
that become his front window and vehicle mode "nose" suffer a bit because
of the odd shape of said pieces. Both of Breakdown's hands are molded so
that he can hold his (or some other) Cyberverse weapon, but due to the
transformation, you can also peg them onto the side of either of his forearms.
The middle of his back-mounted wheel can also hold a Cyberverse weapon
for "storage" here, though because of the placement it can't really be
used well in vehicle mode.

    Breakdown's vehicle
mode is pretty well-done for the size class, but his arms in robot mode
are really awkward-looking and badly articulated, and I wish his knees
could've moved some more given the transformation, as well. He also could've
used a bit more lighter-shaded paint to liven things up a bit. Still, the
toy isn't all that bad-- what IS a crying shame is that this is the ONLY
toy of Breakdown-- a character who's actually
    <i>
     in
    </i>
    the show-- that
you can get domestically, which was just an absolutely bizarre decision
on Hasbro's part, when you've got two 2012 voyager class molds in the same
line that were made of non-show characters. If you like Breakdown and can't
afford imports, unfortunately this is your only real option.

      Breakdown is more than happy to take
any mission Megatron assigns him-- especially if it means a chance to take
on Bulkhead. The two big bruisers have had a beef for a long time, but
Breakdown means for it to end on Earth, once and for all.
