    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Defense Scattorshot.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Defense Scattorshot

     Dropshot is a bit of
an enigma. Usually all of the repaints labeled in the "Classic Series"
of Universe are homages to G1 characters, but Dropshot's paint scheme shares
absolutely nothing in common with the G1 Micromaster of the same name,
even though his stats are the same and the vehicle mode, though not exactly
the same, is somewhat similar. That aside, Dropshot would look fairly at
home in a desert in vehicle mode, due to his predominantly yellow color
scheme. It's not a bright yellow, though, but rather a dull pale yellow.
The dark brown goes very well with the yellow, particularly in robot mode.
The dark green would normally be an okay color for contrasting with the
yellow, but these particular shades just don't work together, IMO-- plus,
it blows the whole "desert" look to him, particularly in robot mode, and
just makes him a rather odd mish-mash of colors. The same goes for his
transparent purple plastic, though it's used so sparingly that's a pretty
small complaint. The light gray is a sort of color that goes with almost
any color, and these are no different-- but it is a rather dull, boring
color, and doesn't really contrast well with any of the other colors. He
does have a fair number of paint apps, such as the painted treads, the
well-painted silver bits on the shoulders and face, and the really nice
silver fade on the front of the "missile packs".

     Dropshot is a great
mold, but the colors used clash a little with each other-- particularly
the dark green-- and aren't the greatest in the first place. I'd recommend
picking up Cybertron Defense Scattorshot before you look for this guy.

         I find it odd that this
mold was used twice in the Universe 2.0 line, but I'm not complaining,
it's a nice mold. Yellowish tan, brown, and military green is a more military
color scheme, as opposed to the blue that was on the original version of
the mold. Unfortunately, the colors are in the wrong places. He desperately
needs some camo in vehicle mode, he's just wayyy to plain. At least a black
paint wash or SOMETHING. Honestly, when you compare this to the other versions
of the mold--
         <a href="uni2overload.html">
          Overload
         </a>
         , Flak, and Scattorshot--
he's really bland in comparison. With that said though, I do like his color
distribution in robot mode, and the bits of translucent purple are really
eye-catching. On the contary, I agree with what Beastbot said, in that
these colors aren't meant to go with each other, at least not in these
amounts, and the translucent purple is moreso random.

         Dropshot is an okay
figure, and even though I received him at no charge, I still dislike the
color scheme. I'd recommend picking up his series-mate Overload instead.

            Decepticon Dropshot is always fighting,
even when no one else is. He takes every opportunity to pick a fight, and
is always the first guy to throw a punch (or fire a missile). If the robot
he's fighting with doesn't fight back, well, that's fine with Decepticon
Dropshot. The way he looks at it, anyone who doesn't fight is a coward,
and deserves a beating. He's not really interested in having a reason to
fight, and he doesn't care whether his side wins or loses, as long as he
gets to pound on someone. Other Decepticons avoid him, unless there are
Autobots around for him to pick on.
