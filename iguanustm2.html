    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 iguana. This mode is very nice, with no extras whatsoever. Like all Transmetal
2s, this Transformer has an asymmetrical look to him. One of the weirdest
things is that one of his beast mode eyes is normal, and the other eye
is robotic and more than twice as large! Although his robot mode chest
can be easily seen through his neck-fins, this doesn't matter too much.
One of the nice things about this mode is that when his missle in his mouth
fires, his neck-fins spring up at the same time, which is a nice effect.
Although Hasbro put in a new type of launcher in this toy that makes the
missle shoot farther than most of the other Beast Wars missle launchers,
it is a LOT harder to lock the missle back in place inside his mouth- you
really have to push.

    Robot mode is very nice
as well, with few extras. Although this toy looks a bit small for a deluxe
in robot mode, he really isn't, he just is almost as wide from front to
back as he is side to side, and this makes him look smaller. The detailing
on this toy is superb, with wires and scales all over the place. His spark
orb is inside a panel of the left side of his chest; it's very easy to
locate. There are three factors in this mode that make Iguanus looks more
like a pirate transformer than anything else: 1. There is a sort of eye
patch nailed to his face over one of his eyes. 2. His tail is connected
to his head, and gives the appearance of his having long "hair" pulled
back in a ponytail. 3. His neck-fins become a sort of ragged "skirt" in
this mode, much like medieval warriors, samurai, and pirates used to wear.
The only complaint I have about this mode is that his missle is supposed
to become a "sword", but the missle doesn't look anything like a sword-
it's much too rounded. They should have made the missle a little bit more
pointy when they thought this Transformer up.

    A very nicely done Transmetal
2. Highly recommended.
