    Instead of being another
repaint of his
    <a href="movstarscream.html">
     original movie voyager toy
    </a>
    ,
Starscream gets an all-new mold in the size class for Revenge of the Fallen.
And man, in vehicle mode it is simply a MASSIVE improvement. Gone is the
bulkiness and rather ridiculous amount of undercarriage robot mode kibble--
instead, even from a side few, it's very streamlined. The only real robot
extras to speak of are the fairly obvious robot hands on the back end,
the only blight on an otherwise very well-designed mode. Starscream still
has the same really dull, boring tan-and-black color scheme that his original
Movie toy had, but this time it's done up in "Cyberglyphic" tattoos that
really add to the attractiveness of the figure. Having little carvings
all ove rhis wings and main body in this mode really make look like more
than your average jet-- and yes, it does sort of ruin the whole "robot
IN DISGUISE" aspect, but when it looks this cool and it isn't used all
the time I can deal wit hit. Starscream has three fold-out landing gear
in this mode as well, and two missiles which can attach under his wings
or be plugged into the launchers on his back end to look sort of like boost
trails.

    Starscream's robot mode
is an improvement over his original Movie Voyager's in some respects, and
worse in others. It's better in the way the overall body is set up-- the
transformation is INSANE while not being overly complicated, with you basically
turning Starscream's main body INSIDE OUT for the bulk of the transformation--
and his tailfins actually fold in to become parts of his chest, a particularly
ingenius. It's a bit wider this time around while still being screen-accurate
without being a bit too absurdly bulky. The wings also fold up behind his
boyd and at the sides of his chest in a very efficient manner, to minimize
any big wing pieces sticking out-- it works remarkably well, particlarly
at the pelvis where the upper tail wings fold in to essentially become
part of the main body and cover up a bit of an unsightly gap that would
be obvious otherwise. Starscream also has a really cool "Mech Alive" gimmick--
turn his head from one side to the other and bunch of little gears in his
chest spin! This is especially impressive given that these parts aren't
even really connected in vehicle mode. Starscream doesn't have those annoying
missile-hands either, but rather regular hands with one spring-loaded missile
launcher on the top of his lower arms (though unlike the box instructions,
they can't flip back anywhere-- that was cut for budget reasons). They're
a little on the wimpy side when compared to Starscream's movie model, however,
and the part where the shoulders connect to the main body still loooks
just as awkward here as it did on the original Voyager (though at least
the connections don't sag under the weight of the arms this time). The
legs are the one part about this Starscream that I would say is definitely
100% worse than the original. The original had the mass and look more or
less right, but on this version the legs-- are way too skinny and short,
even considering Starscream's gorilla-ish proportions. His feet are also
too small, though I do like the pistons sticking out the top of his bird-ankles.
Starscream's head sculpt is also... off... somewhat. I can't quite EXACTLY
pin down what's wrong, but the upper head loooks a bit too skinny. As far
as articulation, Starscream can move side-to-side at the neck, as well
as at the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips
(at three points), knees (at three points), and ankles. This is certainly
fairly good, though the way his missile launchers are situated on his arms
makes them look rather odd in many poses, and his small feet make him a
bit more unstable than he should be.

    I think the new RotF
Voyager Starscream mold is definitely a step up from the previous Movie
Voyager mold, but I don't think it's better in every aspect like many Transfans.
The proportions of the legs and, in some aspects, the arms and head, are
off, and his claws show pretty obviously in alt mode. Still, that's negates
and then some by his excellent man body design, very intuitive transformation,
great tattoo paint apps, and almost flawless alt mode. Definitely recommended
over the original Movie's Voyager Starscream mold.

      The moment his sensor net registered
Megatron going offline, Starscream knew the battle was over, and the AllSpark
lost. He converted to vehicle mode and boosted for outer space, hoping
to buy enough time to rally the Decepticon survivors. Returning from Cybertron
bearing the marks won during his reign over the Decepticon army, he is
focused on conquest. With a new army behind him, he has the strength to
persue his own goals, and perhaps, when the time is right, bring Megatron
back.
