    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Deluxe
Jazz toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Deluxe Jazz toy

     The more things change,
the more things stay the same-- at least when it comes to Transformers'
paint jobs, that is. Enter the Target Exclusive redeco of deluxe Movie
Jazz, which has been painted to look almost exactly like the
     <a href="jazz.html">
      original
G1 Jazz toy
     </a>
     , completely with racing stripes and the original white-and-black
color scheme. He also has the "4" number emblazoned on the front and sides
of his vehicle mode, as well as his name in a logo very similar to the
"Meister" logo on the original G1 toy. The paint apps look really nice,
especially in vehicle mode, and give Jazz some really nice contrast that
simply wasn't there before, as well as a very eye-catching color scheme
this time around. The robot head paint job also looks better, with this
particular mix of black, silver, and blue just seeming much more natural
than Movie Jazz's "real" color scheme. The red is just a TAD too light,
but that's as far as my complaints go when it comes to the colors. Unfortunately,
because of all the extra paint apps in his vehicle mode, Jazz's robot mode
is relatively bereft of paint apps, but his car paint apps are still present
enough in this mode to keep it far from boring-looking.

     Jazz's G1 color scheme
just seems to fit more naturally on the toy and look a lot better, and
I'm not just one to say "It's better cuz it's G1"-- it really does catch
the eye a lot easier and has better contrast than the Movie Jazz's original
colors. If you only get one version of this mold, get this version-- it's
much better-looking than the others.

       During the long process of being rebuilt
by Autobot Ratchet, there was a lot of time to think. Autobot Jazz digs
his Earth vehicle form, but the silver paint job got scratched too easily,
and dust stuck to it like cyberflies on old oil. Also, it wasn't nearly
eye-catching enough. Just because he's supposed to be in disguise doesn't
mean that he can't be noticed. With help from Bumblebee and Autobot Ratchet,
he picked this color scheme as the one most likely to get him appreciative
looks from all the humans the passes on the freeway.
