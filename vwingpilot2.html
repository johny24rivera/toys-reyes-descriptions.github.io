not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the SWTF Shock Trooper.

     This time around the
V-Wing clone pilot has been done up in more "Empire-friendly" colors--
i.e., monochrome, for the most part. Like most Star Wars Transformers,
an off-white forms the main color, with light gray being the main secondary
color. Some of the off-white is a bit brownish in shade, though, making
it a tad more eye-catching. Black is used in significant amounts on the
wings and parts of the mech mode, though, and that contrasts fairly well
with the white and gray. Still, it's pretty boring particularly in vehicle
mode. The chest in mech mode is really the only part that I particularly
like the look off--the nice triangular black designs on the side of the
chest, and the nice metallic gold "pipes" on the stomach, work quite well
together. I really wish that gold had been used in larger amounts on other
parts of the mold.

     The V-Wing Clone Pilot
redeco is honestly pretty boring-looking, with the color scheme being almost
entirely monochrome-- parts of the mech mode chest are the only real exception.
Given that it's already kind of a below-average mold, I can't recommend
this to all but the biggest V-Wing fans, particularly if you're already
got the original Shocktrooper, who is himself nothing to write home about.
