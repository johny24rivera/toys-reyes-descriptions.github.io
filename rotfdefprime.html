is like many of the late-line RotF repaints, in that some deco bits have
been altered along with one of the main colors, but it's by no means a
"full" repaint. The dark blue is pretty much everywhere on this version
of Optimus Prime that it is on the original deco job, though the blue is
a bit flatter, and a slightly duller shade. The main change is that the
front portion of the cab-- as well as more of his robot mode-- has been
changed to a light gray. Having too much light milky gray is already a
problem with many of the movie toys' color schemes, and adding MORE of
it certainly doesn't make Defender Optimus Prime more attractive. It really
makes him look boring, particularly in vehicle mode, where it almost looks
like the front part of his paint job has been burned off because of extreme
heat or something. The change of the flames coming off the front grill
being changed to a light metalllic red helps a little bit, but it doesn't
contrast as much as it should-- a darker metallic red would've looked a
bit better there. (That said, the silver flames against the dark blue look
really nice.) His robot mode looks a little better, with more paint apps
spread out over all his gray plastic to vary it up a bit more-- including
a really nice shade of metallic bronze-- but generally his robot mode also
looks more boring than it did in its original paint job.

     Defender Optimus Prime
is pretty much the antithesis of what you'd want from a redeco of a mold
that's been released several times so far-- it takes the color scheme and
adds in a bunch more gray, thus making it look really boring next to any
other color scheme this mold has had. There's a few minor improvements--
like the shade of bronze in robot mode-- but definitely try to get ANY
of the other voyager class Movie Prime toys before trying to get this one.
Bleh.

       Since the battle in Egypt, Optimus Prime
has outfitted himself with the gear he needs to take out airborne opponents.
Unfortunately, Mindwipe attacks on two fronts, taking cheap shots at the
Autobot from the air, while his hypnotized flunkies assault him on the
ground. Optimus Prime struggles desperately, searching for a way to take
out Mindwipe wihtout harming any of the innocents he's brainwashed.
