    Leadfoot here was only
released in Japan, by TakaraTOMY, though it was originally designed to
be released by Hasbro in the United States and other countries as well,
as a Target exclusive in a two-pack with a
    <a href="dotmtopspin.html">
     Topspin
    </a>
    redeco. Unfortunately, that deal fell through (in a big way-- seriously,
how does a retail company reject a brand new mold made for them with their
company logo dead-center in both modes?!). Thus, even though I don't normally
review TakaraTOMY toys and stick to toys released in the states on my website,
I've made an exception for this guy since the DotM line seems to be missing
a little something without a mainline Leadfoot toy.

    Leadfoot's vehicle mode
is a Chevrolet Impala NASCAR car, but like Topspin, this version is all
weaponized-- and boy, does Leadfoot have a lot of weapons! Beyond the most
obvious bits sticking out of his vehicle mode-- his huge jet-like engines
on the back end-- he's got two missile pods on the sides of the hood, a
regular blaster, a machine gun, and a rotary gun-- and yes, all of these
are removable and can stick in any Mechtech-compatible port on him, of
which there a whopping seven, all reachable in both modes-- a TON for a
deluxe. Leadfoot also comes with a "regular" Mechtech weapon with a gimmick,
though it's a redeco of the
    <a href="dotmratchet.html">
     original deluxe
DotM Ratchet's
    </a>
    chainsaw-gun weapon. (At least they picked one of the
best Mechtech weapons to use again!) There's also exposed robot detailing
all over the place, given that Leadfoot's in his "Stealth Force Mode" for
vehicle mode on this toy, and it all comes together to form a rather busily-detailed
toy, but in a good way. The back end is a bit hollow, but only because
of an engine exhaust port deep in it-- there actually aren't any robot
mode extras beyond what little you can see inside Leadfoot's front transparent
window, which is quite impressive. The overall color scheme of red, black,
and gray works well enough for a NASCAR toy, even if it's not a particularly
eye-catching scheme-- though the bits of silver on the front grill, black-fade
on the "burnt" back ends of the engines, and transparent dark blue headlights
do give his color scheme at least a little bit of pop. The dull milky green
tan-- what little is visible in this mode-- is just a plain ugly color,
however. A straight tan would've worked considerably better-- I'm not sure
why they chose a greenish, sickly shade of the color. The biggest downside
about this mode, really, is that Leadfoot is bereft of his sponsor decals--
yep, TakaraTOMY apparently didn't get the rights to put them on the toy.
As such, despite all the weaponry Leadfoot manages to look a bit "naked"
in this mode, particularly on his front half. This can be fixed by buying
yourself a wonderful set of
    <a href="http://www.reprolabels.com/">
     Reprolabels
    </a>
    stickers for this toy to deck him out in his logos-- this costs extra,
of course, but I think it's more than worth it, particularly since you're
buying an import toy anyways at this point. (This is also why I'm using
official pictures on this review-- my own copy of Leadfoot is decked out
in these stickers.)

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Leadfoot's robot mode
isn't as good as his practically flawless vehicle mode, but it's better
than I'd expect at a deluxe scale, and used a couple of ingenious transformation
"cheats" to pull off an admirable amount of accuracy to the movie model.
Be forewarned, though, that Leadfoot's transformation is rather complex
for a deluxe; he has a few unexpected twists and turns, and the first few
times you might be a bit confused. The end result is definitely Leadfoot,
though, with his relatively stocky, short legs, wheel-front-hood-gut, and
an extremely well-done, silver-painted headsculpt, complete with dark blue
visor. The "gut" doesn't stick out nearly as much as on his movie model,
but that's a bit understandable given how difficult it would be to make
that happen, and it's still most definitely a gut, so it's no big deal
to me. His arms are a bit skinny and two-dimensional, though, which is
a bit of a put-off. Leadfoot does have several obvious panels from his
vehicle mode here that hang off as unapologetic kibble, and it's here where
he gets most of his points taken off on his rating-- long pieces on his
upper arms, more compact pieces on his lower arms, a backpack that-- though
it doesn't get in the way of movement much-- sticks out enough where it's
rather noticeable, and bits of his front bumper also serve as heels in
this mode. They do give him added stability, however, and the lower-arm
panels have weapon posts (his hands aren't sculpted to hold any of his
weapons), so those two obvious bits of kibble don't bug me that much. Despite
those kibble pieces, though, most of them tuck fairly out-of-the-way for
articulation, and the amount of ingenuity that went into incorporating
as many of Leadfoot's actual vehicle bits into his robot mode as there
are overshadows all this, for the most part. His rear two wheels are on
long, independent pieces to allow them to hang below his front hood as
his gut; his turbines serve, quite well and fairly accurately, as his shoulders;
and two small bits near the bottom of his vehicle mode fold together on
his upper chest to make fake car doors, which I think is the most ingenious
move of all. Leadfoot's robot bits have plenty of mold detailing-- springs,
shard-like edges, and the like-- though the increased use of that sickly
tan on his legs and hands helps to wash a lot of this mold detailing out,
unfortunately. For articulation, Leadfoot can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows, inwards at the wrists, the hips (at three points),
the knees, and the ankles. Rotation at his knees and elbows are the only
real points missing here, given how nearly impossible waist articulation
would have been with this design-- and given that he's quite stable, this
means that you can get him into a good number of poses (though his shoulder
movement is a bit restrictive because of the vehicle panels behind it).

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    It's a real crying shame
that this mold never saw release outside of Japan, as it's one of the best
molds in the DotM line and manages to make "another movieverse sportscar"
design very intriguing, fresh, and innovative. Unfortunately, as I type
this this toy is going for big $$$ on eBay-- multiple hundreds, usually--
so this is only for Transformers fans with deeper pockets at this point
(I was lucky enough to get mine when it was being sold for only a bit over
Japanese retail)-- but if you fit that description and like the character,
by all means pick up this awesome mold.

      Leadfoot was one of the best drivers
on Cybertron. His appetite for speed led him to scan one of Earth's fastest
cars for his vehicle mode. His second love? High-powered weaponry! The
firepower carried by this Autobot is so great that much of it is left exposed
in vehicle mode-- a tactic devised to intimidate any Decepticon foolish
enough to take him on!
