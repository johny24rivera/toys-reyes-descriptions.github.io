    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Dune
Runner. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of
the Fallen Dune Runner

     This redeco is meant
to be an homage to the triple-changing character from the original G1 series,
who transformed into both a helicopter and a dune buggy. Well, this one
just transforms into a dune buggy (with weapons). Beyond that, this mold
bears little resemblance to G1 Sandstorm beyond the colors. The colors,
though, are pretty spot-on-- the main plastic color of light orangish tan
is a pretty eye-catching shade, particularly when complemented by the light
orange paint that's most obvious in Sandstorm's vehicle mode and on his
robot chest. By itself, however, these two colors would be a bit bright
as a color scheme, and that's where Sandstorm's black comes in, as a nice
dark contrasting color (particularly in robot mode, where it's more prevalent).
There's a surprisingly large number of other colors (for a Scout-class
toy) that are used as accents-- the silver on the headlights, rear section
and the machine guns looks nice against the black. The paint used for the
front windows is actually a duller shade of silver, something completely
unnecessary but still appreciated as it makes the windows look a bit more
"shaded" and helps them stand out from the surrounding light orange well.
His taillights are painted red as you'd expect, and his robot face has
a light silvery blue visor and a white upper lip. This latter paint app
is my only complaint about Sandstorm color-wise; this facesculpt already
looked way too much like it had a goofy mustache, and now it's downright
impossible not to see that when you look at Sandstorm's face, here. It's
a bit too goofy, in my opinion.

     No mold changes have
been made to "GDO" Sandstorm.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The release of Generations
"GDO" Sandstorm was made largely obsolete when a larger, actual triple-changing,
more direct G1 update was made available at mass retail about a year later.
That said, that still doesn't discount how awesome this color layout looks
on this mold, with just the right amount of each color to make for a pretty
nice "themed" paint job that catches the eye while still being somewhat
realistic. This is my favorite color scheme this mold has had-- if you
want this mold but don't have it, or simply want a "movieverse" Sandstorm,
I'd recommend this redeco. But if you're in for more of a triple-changing,
G1 update, the larger Generations Sandstorm's the one you want.

       Sandstorm doesn't fight for justice
or glory. He fights because explosions, life and death challenges, and
non-stop action are awesome. They are what he lives for. Excitement like
that gets his engine gunning, and nothing is as exciting as fighting Decepticons.
