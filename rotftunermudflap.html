    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe RotF
Mudflap toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
deluxe RotF Mudflap toy

     Tuner Mudflap, like many
redecos of main movie characters, is more of a themed variant than an all-out
complete repaint. Although nearly all of his plastic colors have been changed,
Mudflap still retains the basic orange-and-gray color scheme his original
deluxe toy had. The orange is noticeably darker on this version, however,
and a bit glittery, which makes it look a bit better, in my opinion. The
most obvious change is that Mudflap has a graffiti-esque "speed bolt" painted
on his car doors, which is a pretty cool motif and definitely makes the
vehicle mode look more attractive. Gold plastic has also replaced much
of the light gray plastic in robot mode-- it looks better and goes with
the orange better, in my opinion, but let's home that years down the road
he doesn't suffer from Gold Plastic Syndrome and his limbs start to crumble...
The other change Tuner Mudflap has is that his tinted clear plastic has
been replaced with a transparent dark blue color that really stands out
excellently against the orange, and is a way better color choice. This
color also carried over to his headlights and robot optics (which also
have bits of a nice light blue shade of paint on them), and improves the
look of those parts as well.

     No mold changes have
been made to Tuner Mudflap.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Tuner Mudflap isn't
different enough from the original for me to recommend it if you already
have this mold, but if you don't, every color change this redeco has looks
better than the original's scheme, which makes this an easy recommendation
if you're considering which version of this mold to get and don't particularly
care about strict color scheme accuracy to the movie model.

       There was a time when Mudflap would
have been intimiated by a warrior as accomplished as Sideswipe. But now,
with the final battles of the war in his past, and a hot new engine and
paint job, he's ready to give the Autobot sword-master a run for his money.
Mudflap can't outfight Sideswipe, but there's no doubt in his mind he can
out-drive the older Autobot.
