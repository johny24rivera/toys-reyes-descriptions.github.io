    Slash is the newest member
of the (G1) Dinobots, based loosely on the
    <a href="aoeslash.html">
     Age
of Extinction version
    </a>
    , but of course made robotic to fit her brethren
and made a female as well. In raptor mode, Slash looks pretty good overall,
with one notable exception; the robot legs stick out fairly obviously underneath
her front section and stomach. However, I'm a bit torn on this, because
WITHOUT those legs, she'd look too skinny. So... ideally, I think, there
should have been some way to tuck her legs in more closely to her body--
when viewed from the side, there's a definite gap you can see through much
of her midsection. She also has her robot hands pretty visible on the back
ends of her feet, though given that both her feet and her hands are black,
this isn't nearly as obvious as with the robot legs. Otherwise, the proportions
are pretty good in this mode, with some mechanical details on some places
like her tail and claws, and more complicated robotic details like circuitry
wiring on her transparent pieces on the top of her head, her main body,
and on her hips. Yes, just like the other PotP Dinobots, she has the excellent
combination of clear plastic on those parts with metallic gold painted
on the INSIDE of those parts to give them a really cool look. Most of her
is a milky gray or black plastic, with the main body being red-- again,
fitting her right in with her Dinobot brethren. She's also got some silver
paint along her hips as well as some on her main body. Finally, she has
some red paint on her eyes, though it's a little darker than I would've
liked; maybe making them lighter would've helped them stick out more against
the surrounding gold/clear plastic. For articulation in this mode, Slash
can move at the lower jaw, up-and-down at a bit below the base of her neck
(primarily because of transformation), back-and-forth at her shoulders,
and at her hips (at two points) and knees. I wish her ankles had a bit
more movement, but otherwise she's pretty articulated for a small animal
toy. You can flip up the gold section on her back to reveal a seat for
a Prime/Titan Master to ride in in this mode, which is a pretty nifty addition.

    To transform Slash to
her robot mode, you open up her back section, flip in her head and upper
body section, and close it again; flip out and around her robot legs from
the dino body; flip back the tail to reveal her head; and then change her
dino feet into her robot hands. The end result is a bit neuter in gender
in its look overall, easily being able to pass for a female but the toy
pass for a more lithe male, as well. Anyways, as with Slash's dino mode,
there's some obvious robot kibble here-- the dino arms are the most obvious,
sticking out obivously and obnoxiously behind her upper legs and just kinda
hanging out there without any place to lock into. On a lesser note, there's
also the tail on back, but this mostly sticks in with her overall silhouette
and isn't that big of a deal. Same with the dino claws on the bottom of
her robot arms. If you ignore those bits, though, she's a pretty proportional
robot figure, and fairly well-balanced too despite her small feet (as she
has large heels). Some more basic robotic details and vents are on her
main body and legs, and her headsculpt is nicely done to boot, with a round
head with a vented crest in the center, a red visor, and a normal, silver-painted
mouth and nose. Compared to her dino mode, her red is a bit more apparent
in this mode, with the gold mostly relegated to her shoulders and kneecaps
now whereas the red is most of her main body and on her lower legs as well.
Black and milky gray are still both pretty apparent, with a black stripe
up the center of her body in addition to some silver on her sides. For
articulation, she can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows,
hips (at two points), and knees. Given that her shoulders and hips are
on ball joints, this makes her fairly articulated and poseable.

    Slash is a nice "mini"
addition to the Dinobot ranks, keeping the same basic color scheme and
aesthetic as her larger traditional comrades but adding in a new dino to
the mix. She has at least one obvious piece of kibble in both modes, but
other than that she's a pretty solid mold, with good articulation, proportions,
and a nice gimmick allowing Titan/Prime Masters to "ride" her in dino mode.
I do wish she formed some part of the Dinobot combiner Volcancius, though
(some fans have come up with some "unofficial" combinations, but nothing
official), and that she came with a weapon.
