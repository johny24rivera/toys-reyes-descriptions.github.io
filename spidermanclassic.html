    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Spider-Man. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Marvel TF Spider-Man

     Spider-Man's "classic
costume" repaint isn't much different from this toy's original deco, since
his "classic" costume isn't much different from his modern incarnations.
Really the only major change is that the fairly light blue on the original
has been changed to a dark, flat blue, which contrasts better with the
red, in my opinion. The red is also a tad darker than on the original version,
though this color change isn't nearly as noticeable as the different shade
of blue. Otherwise, all the colors, and paint apps are identical to the
original version, so nothing to say in that respect that wasn't covered
in the previous review.

Spider-Man is a waste of a repaint, honestly. It's so close to the original,
honestly, why bother? It's just replacing two colors with different shades
of those same colors. Just re-release the original if he's a popular figure.
If you're considering which one to buy, I think this one is SLIGHTLY better
than the original due to the slightly darker color scheme and the slightly
increased contrast because of the darker blue. But if you already have
the original one, this one definitely isn't recommended, even if you're
normally a completist.

       Capable of phenomenal acceleration,
and maneuverable enough to weave through traffic as easily as Spider-Man
himself dodges bullets, his motorcycle mode is the ultimate extension of
his style. In mech mode, it duplicates his powers almost perfectly, with
powerful electromagnets that allow wall-crawling, and missile launchers
that fire explosive blasts of webbing strong enough to entangle even the
most powerful machine opponent.
