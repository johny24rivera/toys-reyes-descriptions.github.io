    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
helicopter. This mode is certainly reminiscent of the "official"
    <a href="arcyclonus.html">
     Armada
Cyclonus
    </a>
    toy, but for some reason, the cockpit resembles Cyclonus when
he's plugged into Crumplezone, and not Cyclonus when he's solo. Regardless,
this mode is pretty crummy- but then again, so was the "official" Cyclonus'
vehicle mode as well. The body of the helicopter is too large, the wings
are too small, and his arms are clearly visible under them. His head is
also just right THERE in plain sight, which ruins any look of authenticity
this mode might have had. And although there's excellent mold detailing,
not much of it can be easily seen, since the only paint on this entire
toy is on the robot face. Cyclonus' gimmick is pretty cool, though- roll
him along on a flat surface and his rotor spins faster and faster until
it finally takes off. Granted, you really have to try hard to get this
thing to go THAT fast, but it can happen. Only drawback to this is that
the rotor is a seperate piece, and can come off easily. Cyclonus has one
Powerlinx port on the top tail end of this mode, and a Decepticon symbol
in front of his cockpit windows.

    Basically all you do
to transform Cyclonus into his robot mode is pull his helicopter tail forward
to become his legs and pull up on his head a little. As such, the two modes
are very similar. The huge rotor on the top behind his head just looks
goofy in this mode, however. His chest also sticks out way too far for
a Transformer, and looks ridiculous compared to the straight feet.

    Cyclonus has a cool
spinning rotor gimmick, but that's about it. Unless you're a completist,
pass.
