    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Skyblast. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Skyblast

     Skyblast, compared to
his Energon version, has a much more realistic color scheme this time around,
as is fitting when compared to the other Target Exclusive movie Scout repaints--
after all, the live action movie's aim was to make Transformers as realistic
as possible, so realistic colors are needed to help shoe these in to the
movie line. Movie Skyblast has an overall urban camo color scheme, with
black and a dull gray being his main colors-- hardly exciting colors, but
realistic. The camo paint decos look great on his vehicle mode, with the
white and light tan working fairly well together. The transparent light
purplish brown is a pretty ugly color, however, and doesn't contrast well
with the other colors-- making it a clear weapon or a transparent black
or goldish-yellow weapon would have worked better, methinks. As good as
the camo scheme is in jet mode, however, it breaks up quite a bit in robot
mode and doesn't look nearly as good- especially since the side of his
wings that are the most easily visible in this mode are almost completely
unpainted while the other side of said wings is covered in the stuff--
needless to say, it doesn't look all that hot. The few patches of metallic
greenish gold on the upper legs and head do look nice against their surrounding
colors, however-- I wish it had been used more on the figure.

     No mold changes have

     Movie Skyblast is certainly
a realistic-themed repaint, even if the alternate mode itself isn't very
realistic, but compared to Energon Skyblast he seems rather dull, and the
color used for his transparent pieces isn't attractive at all. Thus, I'd
recommend the original over this repaint.

       A young aerial daredevil with a talent
for painting complex designs in the sky using only his exhaust smoke, Skyblast
is looked on with awe by Decepticon and Autobot alike. No other flyer among
either army is capable of the intricate maneuvers that are this robotÂ’s
specialty. He is friends with few others, preferring to spend his time
alone in the sky he loves. In addition to his incredible skill as a pilot,
he wields a powerful electro-discharge cannon in combat that is capable
if knocking other flyers out of the air with one shot.
