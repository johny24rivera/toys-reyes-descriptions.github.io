    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to PotP Liege Maximo/Skullgrin.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of PotP Liege Maximo/Skullgrin

     It may not look like
it at first glance, but Megatronus and Bomb Burst here are actually remolds
of PotP Liege Maximo and Skullgrin. For Megatronus himself, all the robot
parts are the same, being pretty darned generic overall. The colors are
different, with the main body and lower legs being a fairly dark gray while
the head, arms, upper legs, and backpack/core front are a light, slightly
brownish gray. It's a pretty boring color scheme overall I must say-- yeah,
the two shades of gray do contrast against each other, but they're still
two different shades of gray. They don't pop in any sense of the word.
At least there's a bit of silver paint on the face of Megatronus in robot
mode. The new core sculpt looks really good, with the edges looking like
a series of edgy, metallic entangled vines surrounding the Megatronus symbol,
which is outlined in red and contrasts nicely with the light gray. Said
symbol looks like a sharp, three-pronged crown, both on the top and on
the bottom-- emphasizing not just how Megatronus feels about himself, but
also the first letter of his name to boot. There's also a few "bling lines"
on the edges to show off Megatronus' crown's majesty, I guess. Anyways,
one of the best of the PotP Prime symbol designs.

     Bomb Burst is the Skullgrin
mold, but with a different front section that flips down for the Prime
Master to fit into-- that is, a different head, chest, pelvis, and upper
legs. The new piece is very well-detailed, both in terms of paint and the
mold itself. He's a Bat.... man, not to confused with the DC superhero
of course. The head is a fierce, angular-looking face, with gold eyes and
light blue ears. The chest plate looks like cracked armor, painted a dull
pink with some claw-like details on the top and bottom. The pelvis has
some medieval-like armor details on it, and is painted a somewhat dull
gray. That said, despite the neat new details, Bomb Burst as a whole has
a color scheme just barely above Megatronus', with the claw weapon on the
back, the arms, and the base color of the chest being light bronwnish gray,
while the rest of the body-- the back and the feet-- are a fairly dark
gray. Again, there's a bit of contrast, but not much at all, making this
guy look pretty boring as far as his colors go.

     PotP Megatronus/Bomb
Burst isn't a bad design any more than the other PotP Prime Master sets
are, but the colors are blaaaaannnd, and combine that lack of visual interest
with the issues that all other Prime Master sets have and he's definitely
one of the worst sets released. Not recommended except for completists
or Pretender fans.
