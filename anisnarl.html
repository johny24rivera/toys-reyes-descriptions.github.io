    Snarl's beast mode is
a robotic triceratops, and a definite homage to G1 Slag (the robot's no
longer named Slag because it's become a common Transformers curseword).
This mode is quite close to flawless, and shows off the Animated aesthetic
perfectly. I particularly love the smooth black lines on the triceratops
face and tail, the transparent red horns (though not so much the nose--
what is he, Rudolph?), and the circuitry lines on his head crest. The red/black
designs on his upper legs also fit in well with the Animated look and help
give a bit more diversity to Snarl's paint job, to boot. I'm not sure why
they painted only the front of his head crest gray, though-- it looks odd
having the outline and the back of it red. I would've just molded it in
gray plastic, it would've made more sense that way. The top of the robot
head sticks out entirely too obviously from Snarl's back in this mode--
by far my biggest complaint about this mode-- but other than that, there
are no real robot extras, so no problems there. His club weapon can't be
stored in this mode, though, which irks me. Snarl's articulation in this
mode includes movement at the mouth, the base of each horn, and back-and-forth
at the hips and knees of each of his four feet.

    Snarl's robot mode is
where most of his points get taken off in his overall rating, though there
are some definite things to like about this mode, which I'll get to first.
For one the proportions give Snarl a lot of personality-- I love how his
arms are longer and winder than his legs, and his incredibly stocky body
and very unique/well-done head sculpt just ooze a "big dumb caveman" personality.
Of course, giving Snarl a lava-club, which can be held in one of his hands,
only enhances this aspect of the toy. I also quite like how the tail splits
into two halves and rotates upwards to "frame" the robot mode at the shoulders,
thus enhancing the look instead of just looking like random beast mode
kibble. Little flame-parts also pop out of his shoulders in this mode,
which is a cool little gimmick. As far as articulation goes, he does fairly
well in this area, too-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points),
elbows, at the thumb on each hand as well as the four fingers (which all
move as one part), and at the hips (at two points) and knees. So he's not
extremely posable, but it's certainly enough to "get the job done", as
it were. However, there's some pretty noticeable downsides to Snarl, and
pretty much all of them have to do with his main body-- simply, I hate
how it's constructed. It's almost entirely hollow, and it shows, either
through gaps in his side red pieces, the fact that he has pretty much no
waist, or looking at him from the backside. His waist piece actually connects
considerably in front of where his hips come together, which looks really
odd from a side view. Also, his triceratops head folds up in a really awkward
manner on his chest, not really melding into the overall shape of the toy
at all. Removing the thing altogether and sticking it on his back would
have been a preferable option to this, where it just hangs off his chest
as the most blatant extra in the entire robot mode.

    Snarl has the best alt
mode of any of the Dinobots, but his robot mode suffers for it, as the
main body looks and is hollow and his beast and robot heads stick out and
are rather blatant in both modes. He does have a very unique look befitting
of the Animated toyline, though, and he's far from a terrible toy-- he's
just not the cream of the crop.

      One of the first robots brought to life
on Earth by the power of the AllSpark, Snarl has a lot in common with the
dinosaur whose form he takes in beast mode. He's almost impossible to hurt,
first of all, and he really likes smashing stuff with his tail, or ramming
it with the horns on his head. He prefers his beast mode to his robot mode
because he has more options for how to smash stuff as a triceratops. He
doesn't take delight in random destruction the way some Decepticons do--he
just really likes being strong, and breaking stuff seems like the best
way to enjoy it.
