    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Dead End.

     Well, this is certainly
one of the last characters I expected to see as a BotCon exclusive! Unit-3
is the more sensical name for
     <a href="underthree.html">
      Under-3
     </a>
     , one
of the goofiest Beast Wars Happy Meal toys that transformed from robot
detailing inside a shell into a lion... head. It was so simplistic because
it was only for kids under three, hence the name. Given that Under-3 formed
ONLY a head, making a "vehicle mode" version of that seems a bit easier
than vehicle forms for most other characters that had animal alt-forms,
with Unit-3's alt mode having several features of a lion's head. The central
portion of the bumper is painted black like a lion nose (alternately you
could see the neat red-and-black headlights as nostrils, with the front
bumper being the mouth). There's wavy lines near the back end like a lion's
mane, interrupted only by the unpaintable plastic in the middle of the
car doors-- this plastic is a noticeably paler shade of yellow than the
rest, but it's only used very sparingly. The black windows (even the rear
window is painted!) make for decent "eyes". The robot look is a surprisingly
close match for the original Under-3 toy, with the paint apps on the head,
legs, and to a lesser extent the arms and chest all fairly accurate to
the Happy Meal toy, with a few extra details given the larger size and
detail of Unit-3. As for Unit-3's color scheme itself, much of the plastic
(particularly in vehicle mode) is mostly a fairly straightforward yellow
color, which makes sense. I'm not that big a fan of the color yellow in
most instances, but the black details-- especially in robot mode-- really
contrast against it quite well. What really makes the color scheme pop
is the light red, though-- used on the back, headlights, and Maximal symbol
on the vehicle mode, and on the lower arms, lower legs, eyes, and abs of
the robot mode. It really contrasts extremely well against both the yellow
and black, and keeps Unit-3 from having too much of a "Bumblebee-esque"
color scheme. Silver is also used here and there, like on the head, chest,
lower arms, and wheel hubs-- mostly to help Unit-3 match his Happy Meal
toy a bit better, but the additional paint apps on a toy that already has
quite a few of them is appreciated. (Really, the taillights in vehicle
mode are the only details that could've used some paint that don't have
any.) Unfortunately the hand/foot/gun weapon is a blah light milky gray
plastic, but thankfully that's the only part of the toy that's that color.

     Unit-3 has the same
mold changes made to the base mold as
     <a href="cwstreetwise.html">
      CW Streetwise
     </a>
     ,
but no mold changes unique to this release. Which is fine, since Streetwise's
head and detailing works darned well for the character.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Unit-3 may not exactly
have a lion beast mode, but there's enough "lion-like" details on his vehicle
mode to make it a bit lion-like without going TOO far in that direction,
and the robot mode coloration and paint apps just homage his Happy Meal
predecessor PERFECTLY. Plus, it's one of the best molds from the Combiner
Wars line. Out of all the BotCon 2016 exclusive toys, I feel that this
is the most creative from a concept standpoint, and just a darned fun/unexpected
homage. Highly recommended if you're in the market for BotCon exclusives.

       The Maximal known now only as Unit-3
is the surviving member of the similarly-named battalion. Shocked from
the trauma, he has buried all earlier personality traits under three quadruple-encrypted
layers in his central processing system and now only responds to his new,
self-appointed designation. His commander, Prowl, has tried to find methods
to restore the buried personality algorithms but has only found scraps
of fragmented information. Secretly though, Prowl appreciates him as the
perfect soldier who will follow orders with a lion's heart and a head that
understands the chain of command.

       Unit-3 is a data collection specialist,
sent on special assignments where other investigators have come up empty.
His sensors can detect odors and sounds from vast distances and analyze
trace chemical contaminates in single parts per billion. Banks of processors
hidden throughout his alternate mode allow him to store and process more
information than most other robots.
