    Beast mode is some type
of flying lizard. This mode looks extremely cool- in fact, I'd go so far
as to say that it's the best beast mode of the basic Beast Machines Maximals
(excluding the
    <a href="bmbfts.html">
     Battle for the Spark
    </a>
    line). It
has a very fierce look to it- especially the beast face. The detailing
is exquisite on this toy, which is another plus. Here's an interesting
thing to note- the spark crystal, which is located under a panel on the
top of Geckobot's beast head, actually serves as her eyes when the panel
is closed, which was very creative on the designer's part. The action gimmick
is rather weak, however- by pushing the front fin of each wing forward,
you make the other three move backward. Wow, like
    <i>
     that
    </i>
    serves a
purpose. I suppose it could be interpreted as some kind of "wing-flapping
action", but it really doesn't look like it. Thee other, albeit minor,
downsides to this mode are the lack of jaw movement, the easily visible
robot head on Geckobot's lower neck, and the fact that this toy is rather
small for a basic.

    Robot mode is...well...to
put it bluntly, horrid. With the exception of great posability and detailing,
there are no redeeming features to this mode. The color scheme on the main
body is mostly limited to dark turquoise in this mode- it would have been
nice if there was a bit more color variation, as it makes this look a bit
more like a prototype in this mode than the final product. The beast head
and tail sort of hang off the back, and although they don't get in the
way, they look rather odd- most Beast Machines toys have few, if any, extras
in either mode. Most obvious, however, is the incredibly odd articulation
of the arms. The arms can bend in five different places each, and, to add
to this oddity, the back part of the arms is lodged behind the front part.
I tried for a long while to pose Geckobot's large arms in a position that
would have made them look normal for the picture above, but it was nigh
impossible. An interesting thing to note about Geckobot's head and body
is that is decidedly neutral in gender- the tech spec never refers to Geckobot
as a "he" or "she" either, making the owner responsible for deciding Geckobot's
gender.

    An excellent beast mode,
but this is offset by a very bad robot mode.

      One of the few Maximals capable of aerial
operations, Geckobot is extremely swift and maneuverable when flying. Equipped
with storage cell on back that powers a variety of energy pulse weapons.
Wings and tail act as super-sensitive energy receptors, giving Geckobot
a high level of endurance during long-range reconnaissance or attack missions.
Very intelligent and create - enjoys constructing 'garbage art' sculpture
out of destroyed Vehicons.
