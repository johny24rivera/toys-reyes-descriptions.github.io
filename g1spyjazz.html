    Mold History
   </b>
   : Jazz's mold was originally
planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers: Generation 2,
but it never went through. The mold finally saw release for RiD with the
Side Burn Spychanger, and now it's back again as Autobot Jazz!

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Side Burn Spychanger.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Side Burn Spychanger

     As with all the G1-themed
Spychangers, Autobot Jazz highly resembles his
     <a href="jazz.html">
      G1 counterpart
     </a>
     in vehicle mode. He has the same colored stripe running down his middle
as G1 Jazz did, and he also has the same number "4" in the appropriate
places as well as the "Martini" symbol on his car doors. About the only
thing really missing in this mode is the "tailfin" that the original Jazz
had. It's definitely a solid fan nod. It should be noted, though, that
Jazz himself has few paint apps- most of the decorations, like the stripes
and numbers, are pre-applied stickers. They don't seem to be in any danger
of coming off, though, so it's all good. In robot mode, though, Jazz really
loses his touch- he's almost entirely white, to the point where he looks
prototypish. His black visor is really his only paint app here. There's
no secondary colors at all, and that has to be my main complaint about
Jazz; he really could have used some more black. Of course, the robot mode
doesn't look anything like the original Jazz, but it's a repaint homage,
and you can't really expect those to be too awful close to the actual toy
they're doing the homage to.

     Jazz is a solid toy
in car mode, but he has no secondary colors whatsoever, and this especially
becomes apparent in robot mode. Add to this his slightly-inflated KB Toys
price ($4), and I'd have to recommend the Side Burn spychanger over him
unless you're a particularly rabid Jazz fan.
