    This guy has a bit of
a name issue. In the movie itself-- as well as on the Japanese packaging
that he's released in-- he's referred to by the un-Transformer-y name of
Que-- a nod to 007's scientist helper, but a bit too obvious of one. In
the comics and in most other references to him (like in video games), he's
referred to by the name Wheeljack, which certainly fits with his overall
personality and is more "trademark-friendly" for Hasbro. Anyways, in vehicle
mode Wheeljack is a Mercedes-Benz E550 sportscar. The dark blue plastic
in this mode is pretty much his only major color, but it looks quite similar
to a car finish in terms of the semi-metallic nature of it, so I don't
mind it that much, even if another decoative paint app or two would be
appreciated. The silver trim on his wheels, as well as the paint on his
front bumper, door handles, and silver-and-red paint on his taillights
remain his only main paint apps in this mode. The mold detailing is also
sparse here, but accurate. The proportions are pretty spot-on perfect,
as you'd expect from a licensed alt mode. The only "robot extra" is a very
minor one-- when looked at the side from a level position, you can see
his robot chest jutting just a little below the bottom rim of the car--
but again, this is really being nitpicky. Even his tinted windows are dark
enough where you can't see the robot parts inside. Wheeljack has two Mechtech
ports on his roof in this mode. He comes with a plethora of weapons-- a
long spear, a small gun that looks like a nail gun, another small gun that
looks like a saudering gun, and a Mechtech weapon that looks like a workbench
in its default mode. Unfortunately, only the latter can plug into either
of his Mechtech ports, and it looks rather odd doing so-- his other three
weapons can only be held or attached via C-clips, and can't be stored in
this mode, which bugs me a fair bit and is definitely the weak point of
this mode. Accessories that can't store= accessories that are easier to
lose. His Mechtech "workbench"-- when you press forward on the little gray
slider on it-- extends a sawblade to turn it into a weapon. Like most Mechtech
weapons, however, it can't lock in this mode, and defaults to the "workbench
mode" when you're not pressing on the slider.

    Wheeljack's transformation
to robot mode can be a bit tight in terms of unplugging/tabbing in everything
without accidentally popping anything off, but other than that it's not
overly complicated like some other movieverse toys. The result is a robot
mode that looks considerably more interesting than his rather vanilla "another
sportscar" vehicle mode. Proportions-wise, he's quite good-- his arms are
a tad on the overly lanky side, but other than he's great in this department,
with a solid-looking chest and legs. There is a bit of kibble, however.
Some of it folds out of the way well-- like that on the back of his legs
and his backpack, which is a bit noticeable but doesn't get in the way
of movement much-- but the odd straps formed between his shoulders and
his chest don't peg together anywhere and look a bit odd. The car panels
on the sides of his hips also are rather obtrusive when it comes to moving
him around in that area. The color scheme is broken up considerably more
in this mode. The good news is that the addition of a light milky aquamarine
complements his dark blue very well, and the bronze and silver paint apps
on his face, chest, and upper legs look great and help to add at least
a little more color there. However, the bad news is that the VERY over-used
color gray is also apparent in this mode, between the blah light milky
gray and the slightly-less-blah darker brownish shade of the color. The
dark gray serves as a decent enough color, but I really wish that light
milky gray had been replaced with another color, like some more aquamarine
or something. The mold detailing is incredibly well-done in this mode,
with all the relevant details on his chest, arms, and the like. His head
detailing is remarkably intricate and movie-accurate-- however, I don't
like the headsculpt at all, and here's why-- it's very obviously just a
robotic take on Albert Einstein's face. Yes, it gets across his personality
quickly, but the more "human" features on TFs tend to be a bit more vague
or taken from general stereotypes and not an actual historical person.
Here, it's just not inspiring at all and I have difficulty seeing it as
a Wheeljack/Que head and not an Einstein mecha. Wheeljack has four Mechtech
ports in this mode-- two on his upper back, and one on the back side of
each of his forearms, so can pump him up with weapons pretty nicely. He
also has two C-clip points on the sides of his chest which-- when you attach
his little weapons to it-- makes for a fairly convincing "toolbelt" look.
His hands can also hold all his weapons, so everything's storable in THIS
mode, at least. For articulation Wheeljack can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at three points), waist, hips (at two points),
knees, and slightly at the ankles. Thus, he's got a pretty decent range,
though the kibble on his shoulders and hips restricts a lot of the movement
range at those points.

    Dark of the Moon Que/Wheeljack
is one of the better deluxe molds from the line. His vehicle mode is admittedly
rather boring and too "same-ish" among the various other movieverse Autobots,
but it's a very accurate mode. As a robot, Wheeljack suffers from a few
minor kibble issues and a headsculpt that-- though accurate-- I do not
like at all, but he's got good proportions and articulation and a host
of accessories that really increase his play value. Unfortunately, this
toy was only released by TakaraTOMY for Japan and some of the Asian market--
his Hasbro release was cancelled due to flagging sales for the DotM line,
so you'll have to spend more than usual to pick up this guy. If the price
doesn't automatically disqualify him for you, though, I consider him worth
it.

have failed spectacularly, but when they succeed, they often change the
