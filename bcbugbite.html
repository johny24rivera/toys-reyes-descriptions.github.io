    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics deluxe Bumblebee.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics deluxe Bumblebee

     Bugbite is a Decepticon
with a bit of a history-- Bugbite was originally a Gobot from the '80s
who transformed into a car almost identical to Bumblebee. Much later, Bugbite
was released as a white Decepticon repaint of the G1 Bumblebee mold in
Japan, as an homage to the character. And now, Bugbite shows up here in
the states as a Botcon exclusive with a similar repaint idea, but with
some a few additional paint additions. The basic black/white/purple scheme
works quite well, and the red and silver accents work pretty well, particularly
against the black. I also really like the shade of white they used-- it's
not a straight white, but more of a pearlescent color with just the slightest
tinge of purple in it-- and it makes Bugbite's colors look a bit more eeevil,
like he's a bit ghostly or something. The purple tribal tattoos on his
vehicle mode look really sweet, too, and help to break up what would otherwise
be a fairly dull alternate mode without those nifty, eeeevil designs (same
goes for the purple fade pattern on the trailer, too). And, surprisingly,
the Bumblebee head works as an evil character, with the friendly smile
looking more like an evil smirk what with the red eyes and all. The only
complaint I have about the colors is that his arms and legs in robot mode
are completely black, and devoid of any paint apps to break up that color
a bit more.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon Bugbite, though he does have the same widened space
on the chest for the faction rub symbol that
     <a href="clascliffjumper.html">

     has, but earlier versions of Classics Bumblebee didn't.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Bugbite is a pretty
interesting and unexpected homage repaint for an exclusive, but it works
pretty well, and the tribal paint apps look especially eye-catching. Color-wise,
I don't think he QUITE measures up to Classics Cliffjumper, but I think
he easily outclasses Classics Bumblebee.

       Bugbite is a Decepticon shrouded in
mystery. Many serving under Bludgeon are unsure as to why he gained such
favor. commander of one of the finest ships within Bludgeon's army, Bugbite
enjoys unusual freedom of action, often disappearing for months at a time
with his eclectic crew of ne'er-do-wells on missions of which none of them
ever speak. Many under his command have abandoned partners and friends
without a word leading many to suspect even greater duplicity than is typical
among the Decepticons.
