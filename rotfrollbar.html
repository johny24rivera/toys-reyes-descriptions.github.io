    Rollbar's vehicle mode
is a delivery truck-- something you don't see Transformers take alt modes
of all that often. The proportions for this mode are pretty spot-on, with
the exception of a few minor robot bits on the very rear end, but that's
a small quibble at best. The gray plastic is fairly dull, but the dark
blue works quite well with it, and there's enough paint apps to keep Rollbar's
color scheme from getting outright boring. The windows are painted, as
are the headlights, the bumper-- all the necessary details, plus a "red
bull/star" logo which, combined with the color scheme, probably makes Rollbar
some kind of generic Red Bull delivery truck, which is a nice touch. The
silver Autobot symbol on the left side of the front area looks really random,
though-- not only is it in an odd, very asymmetrical place, but it almost
blends in completely with the surrounding gray... what's the point? The
mold detailing is pretty sparse in this mode, especially for a movie toy,
but given the alt mode it's at least fitting, even if it makes the mode
look a little more "simple" than it otherwise would have.

    Rollbar's transformation
is fairly innovative, particularly for his size class-- the way the back
part of his vehicle mode folds up and around to become "fake windows" on
his robot chest and how his real truck front goes behind his back is a
pretty nice touch. Unfortunately, it doesn't save the robot mode from some
rather clunky problems. First and foremost, there's almost entire halves
of his vehicle mode hanging off his body behind his arms, which are definitely
an eyesore (though at least they tab in securely to the main body-- and
using the rear-view mirrors from vehicle mode as the tabs was a stroke
of genius). His arms are also really wimpy, and are honestly a bit overshadowed
by the aforementioned big hunks of vehicle mode hanging behind him. The
legs, chest, and head all have great proportions, though, and excellent,
highly-detailed mold sculpting. The head looks sort of like "Prime Jr."
in a way, what with the familiar dark blue/silver/yellow coloration and
the faceplate. One more color is introduced into the overall color scheme
in this mode-- sky blue-- but it just doesn't work with this color scheme
at all. It's way too light and random, and honestly looks prototype-ish
in its coloration. There's also the continuation of the random Autobot
symbol placement in this mode, what with Rollbar's allegiance symbol being
on the side of his left leg. I guess he's not all that proud of his allegiance?
As far as articulation goes, that's sadly Rollbar's second-biggest weakness
next to his vehicle kibble-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two
points), elbows, hips, and knees. That's not TOO bad in and of itself,
especially given that most of those joints are ball joints, but yet again
the vehicle kibble comes into play here. It prevents a lot of cool arm
poses, given their inability to move back at the shoulders much, and trying
to get his legs into his dynamic poses often fails because the kibble makes
him rather back-heavy.

    RotF Rollbar is the
weakest of the first-wave Scouts of the line. Although he has an excellent
vehicle mode, two big pieces of his alt mode hanging off his robot mode
present two big problems, both in terms of interfering with movement and
just generally looking bad. His rather random sky blue plastic doesn't
help much with his otherwise okay color scheme, either.

      Rollbar is happiest when he's following
orders. He is uncomfortable with improvisation, and terrified of being
put into a leadership position. Despite that, he is a highly skilled navigator,
and has a keen mind for tactics, making him an invaluable asset to his
commanders. He is extremely strong and tough, and though he prefers not
to fight, he can be a challenge to Decepticons many times his size
