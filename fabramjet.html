    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Battle Blade Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Battle Blade Starscream

     Alright, finally a Fast
Action Battler-only Movie character (even if it is just a repaint)! Ramjet
is an homage to the G1 character of the same name, what with being a repaint
of Movie Starscream and having similar colors to his G1 counterpart. The
light gray, by itself, doesn't look all that different from Movie Starscream,
but the addition of dull red and black really contrast well with the main
color and make the toy infinitely more interesting-looking, even ignoring
the G1 colors. Ramjet certainly has a wider variety of colors than FAB
Starscream, especially in robot mode-- no large patches of only one color
here! His black-painted face with the red optics also looks really, REALLY
evil. I also particularly like the paint apps on his wings in vehicle mode--
the black and gray bordering on the dull red wings looks really nice, and
the silver Decepticon symbols on the wings are just icing on the color
scheme cake.

     No mold changes have
been made to Claw Slash Ramjet.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Claw Slash Ramjet's
colors look quite good together are a definite improvement over the rather
bland-looking Battle Blade Starscream. Too bad the mold itself isn't much
to look at, or I'd recommend this toy.

       Ramjet is crazy, even by Decepticon
standards. He's got missiles, lasers, cluster bombs, and even vibro-claws
sharp enough to cut duratanium armor, but he'd rather just smash head first
into his enemies. A lifetime of head injuries has left him a little muddy
in his thinking, but he is super tough.
