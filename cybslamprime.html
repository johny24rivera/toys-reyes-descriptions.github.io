    As is the case with all
the toys in the Cyber Slammers subline, Optimus Prime's vehicle mode is
a chibi-fied version of his movie truck mode, being much wider and stubbier
than it would be in real life. The colors picked for Prime are excellent
shades, though-- in fact, I'd venture to say that of all the toys of Movie
Prime sporting the red-and-blue flame deco, the colors on this one are
the best. The glitter mixed in with the red plastic makes it look really,
really nice, and the same goes for the blue flames as well. The silver
and black also contrast very nicely against the red and blue, and the light
silvery blue is an appropriate color for the truck windows. He could use
more paint detailing on the rear half of this mode, but otherwise he looks
great, and although his mold detailing is definitely sparse compared to
most of the other movie toys aimed at older kids, it's pretty above the
standard level of detail set by the other Cyber Slammers.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Optimus Prime can be locked in truck mode by pushing the white tab on the
bottom of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Prime's robot
body into his vehicle mode, the truck will take off (providing he's on
a flat surface), and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode
body will pop back up again. Because of this gimmick, Optimus doesn't really
have any lower body in robot mode, just most of his truck mode. His main
body, head, and arms are molded onto the underside of his truck mode roof
and doors. The paint and mold detailing is very good on his robot parts,
however, especially on his chest. His head also has some nice detailing
on it, but those weird "big iris" eyes just don't work on someone like
Prime. Like the other Cyber Slammers, Prime's articulation is very limited--
his head can move from side to side and his arms can move back-and-forth
at the shoulders, though the shoulders snap back into their default position
once you let go of them. Unlike some of car Cyber Slammers like

    </a>
    ,
however, because of the nature of his alternate mode, the vehicle parts
hanging off Prime's arms in this mode are a lot larger than on the car
Cyber Slammers, which looks a bit more unsightly, not to mention the vehicle
wheel base is a bit larger. Granted, these are rather small beefs since
this toy is aimed at kids who won't care about stuff like that, but it
is worth mentioning.

    Overall, Optimus is
roughly average as far as Cyber Slammers go-- he has a bit more "kibble"
in robot mode (though having vehicle kibble in robot mode certainly isn't
something the Cyber Slammer subline is shy about), but on the other hand
his colors are excellent and play off of each other very well, not to mention
he has quite a bit of paint detailing.
