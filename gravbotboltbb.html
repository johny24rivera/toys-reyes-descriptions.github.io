    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Gravity Bot
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Bolt Bumblebee is a bit
different from your typical "inverted colors" Movie Bumblebee repaint.
Yes, he's mostly black, and yes, his primary accent color is of the yellowish
kind. However, his lightning bolts and robot mode helmet are made of an
EXTREMELY nice-looking metallic gold, and really work well with the black.
Plus, Bolt Bumblebee also has some metallic bronze, silver, and metallic
bluish silver as well, making him look very metallic indeed as far as the
accent colors go. Even the lesser-used accent colors, such as a bit of
light sky blue and red, really pop on the few places they're used and stand
out greatly from the black and other colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Bolt Bumblebee.

     Yes, he's "just" a Gravity
Bot repaint, but Bolt Bumblebee has an outstanding deco job, with all of
his paint colors-- mostly metallic-- really working well against the black
and other basic colors. Plus, gold lightning bolts are just schnazzy. Definitely
recommended over the original Gravity Bot Bumblebee; I wish this same gold
coloration had been applied to more of the various Movie Bumblebee repaints,
that's for sure.
