    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Grimlock. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     As is evident by the
name, this repaint of Activator Grimlock has been done up in very fiery,
magma-like colors. Light red, black, and brown are the dominant colors,
with the red being just the right color for "lava" while the brown looks
more like "cooled lava". Quite a creative combination, there. The bits
of orangish yellow-- another magma-y color-- also contrast against the
other colors quite well and help to round out the whole package. However,
what really brings this repaint up from just "cool" to "fantastic!" are
the jagged, stylized "lava vein" paint apps on the robot chest and legs,
as well as the jagged "dirt" paint apps on the robot shoulders/dino hips.
They REALLY make Grimlock look like he's made of pure lava rock now, and
though they might look a bit over-the-top on a "normal" Transformers figure,
on a stylized Animated figure they fit right in. The fade paint app on
the dino back that goes from light red to dark brown to yellow at the tail
is also a great paint apps, as well. If I had to make one complaint-- however
small-- about the toy's paint job, it would be that the dark brown jagged
"dirt" paint apps on the shoulders are hard to see against the black--
they don't contrast well enough.

     Fireblast Grimlock is
an utterly fantastic repaint, with every color having its place on the
toy and the great "lava vein" and fade paint apps really making the character
look elemental and fiery. A great redeco for an Animated toy-- if you get
only one Activator version of a character you already have a "mainline"
version of, make it Fireblast Grimlock.

       When Lugnut dropped Grimlock into a
volcano, he thought he'd seen the last of the Dinobot. Grimlock loved the
hot lava and absorbed its power into his body. His supercharged breath
can melt asphalt into tar in seconds, which Grimlock plans to use to trap
Lugnut on the ground, where he can't escape.
