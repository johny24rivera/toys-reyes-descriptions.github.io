    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Dinobot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

is definitely the 'bot who has the most color scheme changes when compared
with the original version's paint job-- literally none of the colors on
this toy are the same as on the original version. And overall, this version
of Dinobot looks more show-accurate than the old version-- the light bronzish
brown color used for the dino flesh is dead-on accurate with the TV show,
the face is painted correctly, and the dark brown used on the stripes is
also accurate to the show. However, this is a toy that definitely fits
into the category of "so close, yet so far". For some reason I can't fathom,
Dinobot's legs have different paint apps this time, which, at least in
their placement, is very show-accurate-- however, the "bone" paint apps
are GREEN, not bone white like they should be. The blue coloration on the
inside of his tail-spinner is also not show-accurate AND doesn't look that
good to boot. Plus, his sword (which, surprisingly, isn't short 'n stubby
like the last time this mold was used for
     <a href="tfdbgrimlock.html">
      Transformers
Dinobot Grimlock
     </a>
     ), should be silver, as well as some other parts of
his legs, and his upper arms should be the same color as his lower arms.
His beast mode eyes are also blue, when they should be white. Dinobot DOES
sport a nifty new Maximal allegiance symbol paint app on the left side
of his chest, though.

is really a missed opportunity-- some colors are spot-on show-accurate,
while a few others are completely wrong, and you have to wonder what the
designers were thinking when they made the 10th Anniverary toy look this
way when the entire POINT of this line was to make the old toys more show-accurate!
Taken by itself, the color scheme isn't bad, but it really aggravates me
that such an opportunity was passed up. Still, I think the toy does look
better than the original Beast Wars Dinobot.

       A warrior to his core, Dinobot lived
only for honor won in combat. Disgusted by the greed and dishonesty of
Megatron, and with a life debt owed to the Maximal leader, he joined Optimus
Primal. Though Dinobot was never fully trusted by some Maximals, his strong
honor code and philosophical nature led him always to the path of victory.
He was one of many to fall in the Beast Wars, sacrificing his life in a
heroic battle against overwhelming Predacon attack.
