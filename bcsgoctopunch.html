     Shattered Glass Octopunch,
despite the lack of a shell and different alt mode, shares the same general
colors as his original G1 version's Pretender monster shell. His main colors
of a nice dark seafoam green and gray work well together, particularly
with the fuchsia and translucent yellow secondary colors. There's also
a rather nice shade of plastic used for most of his upper body (or top
of the vehicle mode) that's halfway between the off-white and seafoam green
colors used on other parts of his mold. It really works well, having that
nice "transition" effect in place there. Since this mold doesn't have a
whole lot of "Octo" in "Octopunch", his chest has four tentacles painted
on it. While I think it's rather creative that these blue tentacles come
down his chest and look like they "poke out" along the molded wires near
the bottom of Octopunch's chest, at the top they're rather unfortunately
positioned-- they look a LOT like duck heads facing each other. Seriously,
when I first saw the toy I saw those BEFORE I saw that they were tentacles.
You'd have thought that the people putting these together would have seen
that, but I suppose not. Using this mold as Octopunch also takes advantage
of the toy's scuba-diver-like headsculpt, given that the original Octopunch's
Pretender shell had a scuba-diver head as well, and Shattered Glass Octopunch's
head is painted very similar to G1 Octopunch's "head dome" in terms of
the color layout-- a really nice nod, there, that really sells this as
Octopunch.

     Shattered Glass Octopunch
has a great color scheme that's both pretty original and homages his G1
Pretender shell's colors quite well. The tentacle paint apps and head color
layout are also really nice nods to his original version to boot. Couple
this with it being a great toy, and you've got one of the better Botcon
exclusives here, definitely. Plus, if you don't like Shattered Glass, simply
cover up his red Decepticon symbol with a normal purple one and it would
be very easy to repurpose him as a normal "Classics" Octopunch instead.

       Octopunch never really got the hang
of this "war" thing, but it wasn't the fighting that confused him. It was
the passion everyone put into it. To him, being a soldier just meant having
a new job and when you have a job, you do it well. Ask any Decepticon and
they'll tell you, Octopunch is an average 'Con; he likes mechatecha-soccer,
enjoys an energy-brew, and unlike most of his comrades, he has no major
psychological hang-ups or eccentricities.

       Octopunch wields a pair of positron-torpedo
launchers capable of bringing titanium alloy to the boiling point in a
single impact. In vehicle mode, he can skim over the surface of any liquid
or solid surface, though uneven terrain can hamper his movement. Experimental
rheaniumum rust-proofing, originally intended to allow for unlimited underwater
functionality, inadvertently rendered him immune to nanotech weapons, making
him an invaluable resource against the infectious Junkions.
