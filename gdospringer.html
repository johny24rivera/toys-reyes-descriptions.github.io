    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Tomahawk.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Tomahawk

     This version of Springer--
like many "redeco toys" of him-- has decided to leave the "triple-changing"
aspect aside, and instead has focused on one of his G1 toy's alt modes--
in this case, the helicopter mode. Having an Apache-esque helicopter works
great for Springer's vehicle mode, and this version focuses on more of
his gray coloration in vehicle mode, with his light and dark green plastic
colors coming more into play in robot mode. I quite like this decision,
as it makes the modes look a bit more individualistic, given the mold's
simplistic transformation. The light and dark green are both great shades
of the color, and complement and contrast against the others excellently,
particularly the black and yellow. The gray on the helicopter mode does
admittedly look a bit dull, but at least it's realistic. Springer's also
got some light milky brownish gray used for "minor" parts like his landing
gear, missiles, and waist piece-- I'm not fond of this color, so I'm glad
it's used sparingly. The other accent colors are some yellow trim in vehicle
mode, some silver on his face and tailfan, and a rather unique striped
light-blue-and-greenish-gold pattern on his wings. The yellow and the wing
patterns really help to shake up his alt mode in particular, keeping any
one large part from being just one color (bluish-gray, in particular).
I do wish that his dark green plastic was used in a few other places, though,
as it's a GREAT shade and is only really visible in robot mode.

     GDO Springer has two
mold changes-- first off, he has a new head mold, and a very G1-y head
mold at that. It looks almost unchanged from his G1 design, with the proportions
only SLIGHTLY modernized. The head itself looks great-- but not on this
movie-esque body. With the chicken-walker-like legs of the robot mode and
the general look of the toy, the head sticks out like a sore thumb-- even
if you had never seen Tomahawk, you'd KNOW from looking at Springer that
this was not this toy's initial head sculpt. On a more positive note, Springer
comes with a sword accessory, which can be stored underneath one of his
wings in helicopter mode (or, obviously, held in one of his hands). It's
nice to see Springer's signature weapon make it onto this toy.

     Generations "GDO" Springer
is a pretty decent mold with a fairly nice and fairly G1-accurate color
scheme. However, his head is incredibly out-of-place on a movieverse toy,
and a new mold, triple-changing Springer was released less than a year
after this toy, making this release of the character a very hard recommendation
despite his decent score, unless you're either a diehard Springer fan or
just really really like this mold.

       Whenever danger strikes, Autobot Springer
is there to strike back. He leaps into action at a moment's notice, never
caring for his own safety as long as there are others to protect. His heroic
nature is backed up by incredible natural fighting skills and the inborn
ability to lead.
