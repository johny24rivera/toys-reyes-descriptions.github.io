    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Waspinator. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Beast Wars Waspinator

     Waspinator's color scheme,
though certainly not a polar opposite scheme when compared to the original
toy, is substantially different from its predecessor. The green on Waspy
has been lightened up a bit and given a more attractive metallic sheen
to it-- a softer, lighter green has also been added to the appropriate
parts to make Waspy a bit more show-accurate. The transparent plastic used
for the wings, missiles, and eyes also has a softer bluish tint to it,
and the insect head eyes also have a lighter shade of blue on them. The
yellow on the striped pattern on the thorax and upper legs also has a more
golden metallic sheen to it. In addition, a few brand-new paint apps have
been added to Waspy to make him a bit more show-accurate-- namely, the
yellow patterns on the lower legs and the black rims around the eyes (though
I think the rims are a bit too thick on the upper portion of the eyes).
The head antennae and mandibles have also been colored yellow, the latter
isn't really a show-accurate paint app. There's a small Predacon symbol
on Waspinator's upper back now, as well. The only real thing I would have
changed is taking away the mustard yellow on Waspinator's shoulders and
waist pieces-- they're not show-accurate at all, the soft green should
have been used in their place instead. All of the colors come together
quite well, however, and make Waspy look pretty darn cool.

     No mold changes have
been made to 10th Anniversary Waspinator. Before you buy him, however,
you may want to look around the twisty tie surrounding his thorax in the
package-- I didn't, and I found out too late that the twisty tie had scraped
off some of the metallic paint of the thorax in the package.

     10th Anniversary Waspinator
is a great repaint, with some great metallic-looking colors and some nice
new show-accurate paint apps. Not just the most show-accurate scheme out
of the three this toy has had, but also definitely the best-looking.
