    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RotF Legends class Bumblebee

     Cyberfire Bumblebee here
is another "variant" of Legends Bumblebee as opposed to a "genuine" full
redeco. The base colors of dull yellow and black are the exact same as
on the original-- the main difference here is that the deco job in vehicle
mode is a bit of a loose homage to
     <a href="anibumblebee.html">
      Animated
Bumblebee
     </a>
     , what with the two stripes on the left side of the toy. There's
a few more additions beyond just that, though-- there's a bit of an overly
large Autobot symbol on the right side of the roof, and smaller flame-with-Autobot-symbol
paint apps on the sides to justify the "fire" in Cyberfire Bumblebee's
name. The windows are also painted a silvery blue on this version as opposed
to the (in my opinion, better) moderately dark blue windows on the original
RotF Legends Bumblebee. It makes sense though, as the windows are ALSO
roughly the same shade here as on Animated Bumblebee. The front bumper
bits are painted silver on this version, but the taillights and back bumper
are sadly left unpainted on this version.

     Cyberfire Bumblebee's
pretty meh. Oh, it's a good Legends mold with a decent enough paint job--
but this toy has been done in these colors enough times by now, and just
a few different paint apps in vehicle mode isn't near enough to justify
purchasing it again, even if you're a fan of the mold. If you're a big
Animated Bumblebee fan who ALSO likes the movie aesthetic, this might hold
some minor draw, but otherwise there's really no point to pick up this
toy.
