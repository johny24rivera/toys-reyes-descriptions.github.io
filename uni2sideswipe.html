    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Sunstreaker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe 2.0 Sunstreaker

     Sideswipe's colors are
very accurate to his
     <a href="g1sideswipe.html">
      G1 toy
     </a>
     . Though red,
black, and white isn't a very original color scheme at this point, it still
looks nice, and just the right amount of each color is used (particularly
in robot mode). The shade of red used-- which has an ever-so-slight swirly,
glossy quality to it-- also look fantastic even by itself, which makes
the almost entirely red vehicle mode much more attractive than Sunstreaker's
yellow. The silver and yellow accents also really contrast well with the
other colors, and using a very dark translucent black for the windows in
vehicle mode was a nice idea-- they look like they're clear, but still
heavily tinted, thus hiding any robot bits that you may have been able
to see through them. Sideswipe's red paint also meshes very well with his
red plastic, which is a big plus, particularly in car mode. I also like
the black stripes along his sides and the clear-silver headlights, they
both really look nice and add something extra to the vehicle mode.

     Sideswipe has one mold
change-- the head is new and designed to look like his G1 self, and is
a very well-done sculpt. However, this mold was actually designed in advance
for Sideswipe, so Sideswipe actually has an alternate transformation from
Sunstreaker, even though no mold changes in those respects have been made!
It basically ends up with him having a G1-accurate chest and a quite accurate
robot mode, despite sharing 95% of his mold with Sunstreaker. An utterly
brilliant move, I must say. As far as looks go, I think the design is slightly
better than Sunstreaker's, as the front hood for the chest meshes with
the surrounding parts better than Sunstreaker's chest.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Sidewipe
is a fantastic mold in a fantastic color scheme, and even if you already
have Universe 2.0 Sunstreaker, he has an alternate transformation and a
new head, thus making his robot mode partially "new" as well. Highly recommended,
even if you already have Universe 2.0 Sunstreaker.

       Sideswipe is a natural-born fighter.
He's had little formal training in the arts of war, yet he has an instinctive
nature that makes him one of the most dangerous warriors among the Autobots.
He is not as self-centered or cold blooded as his brother Sunstreaker,
but the two are nonetheless close. When they fight side by side, they are
truly a force to be reckoned with.
