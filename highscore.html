    High Score's alternate
mode is a video game controller, similar in its button layout to any of
the Sony Playstation systems, but with a few aesthetic (and color) differences
to avoid licensing and copyright issues. Overall, this mode is very good,
with perfect proportions from any angle, albeit the size is the main thing
that keeps it from being able to pass as a real game controller at a glance--
High Score's only about half the size of a real game controller, one of
the biggest size discrepencies among the Real Gear toys. Also, unlike Power
Up, High Score's buttons aren't able to be pushed in, which is a bummer
and rather ruins the playablity factor of this mode, limited as it admittedly
is. High Score has all the mold detailing required of his alternate mode,
albeit it not much more. His paint detailing is rather lacking, though,
as only a few of his buttons are colored and he only has a few more paint
apps in robot mode that aren't visible in this mode. The overall color
scheme of off-white and gray with green accents also isn't particularly
eye-catching, but it's realistic for a game controller and the colors certainly
don't clash, so I don't have a problem with it.

    Even though his alternate
mode is pretty good, High Score's robot mode is where he REALLY shines.
Not only does he have practically no alt mode kibble-- the flap behind
his head is the only exception here-- he has great articulation, proportions,
and is just an all-around awesome figure. His long arms and small feet--
no doubt intentional-- make him look rough 'n tough, and give him tons
of personality. His visored, faceplated head design also looks pretty darned
cool, too. He can move at the head, shoulders, elbows, waist, hips, knees,
and ankles (at two points), though many of these are on ball joints that
allow for nearly unrestricted movement (the only exception is the knees,
which are a little limited in how far they can move forward). His colors--
namely the increased amount of visible dark metallic green-- look better
in this mode and break up each other better, as well. Honestly, the only
real complaint I have about this mode-- and it's a pretty small one-- is
that there's a rather noticeable gap between High Score's head and his
chest. Other than that, he's pretty much perfect here.

    High Score 100 is, in
my opinion, the best Real Gear mold, and that's really saying something.
His robot mode is practically flawless, unique, loaded with personality,
and his controller mode has perfect proportions, even if the size discrepancy
between him and a real game controller is pretty noticeable. Highly recommended,
unless you're a huge Halo fan, in which case you may want to wait for the

      High Score 100 has been made into a
master martial artist by years of watching some of the most dangerous fighters
in the known universe try their skill against one another. By careful observation,
and copying their moves over and over again, he has reached a level of
fighting skill previously unheard of among Transformers. If you are patient,
and willing to learn, he will teach what he knows, but be warned: the path
to ultimate power is fraught with hazards.
