    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Sergeant Kup.

     Swerve's been a somewhat
constant character to turn up as a repaint of someone else, though up until
now his various redecos (except the original G1 toy) have all been of cars.
This redeco changes that, finally returning Swerve to his original alt
mode of a truck. Red and black works very well for a truck (and just in
general), and although he doesn't have any fancy decals on the doors or
anything like that, the silver on his bumpers and front grill-- as well
as the large Autobot symbol on his roof and having his front hood painted
black-- help break up his color scheme enough where his truck mode doesn't
look too bland. A little bit of white shows up in his truck bed, but the
vast majority of the color makes itself known in robot mode, thus making
the robot "reveal" of a new color a nice change, too. The white obviously
contrasts well with the black, but also the red as well; Swerve is a character
with mostly primary, Autobot-y colors, and they all work quite well on
this redeco. He does have a bit of a slightly ugly shade of light milky
brownish gray used on a few minor parts like his lower arms and upper legs,
however, and this isn't just a very appetizing color to me. Making all
of his gray the same mid-range, slightly metallic-looking hue of plastic
that his rifle and a few other minor connector parts are made of would
have been the better choice here, methinks.

     The only mold change
made to Swerve is that he has a new head-- a head that calls back some
of his G1 self, like the red helmet and white face. However, this toy was
released just as Swerve finally became a semi-main character in the popular
comic
     <i>
      More Than Meets The Eye
     </i>
     , where a short, stumpy, visor-faced
comedian became the persona most associated with him. Thus-- through no
fault of Hasbro's own, at this point-- this head mold doesn't really evoke
Swerve as he's come to be known, given that he has two clearly separate
eyes on his face and a pretty serious expression (in addition to not being
a squat little guy). It's a good head sculpt, though.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Swerve is an excellent,
interesting redeco of the Kup mold, hitting all the right notes in terms
of his primary color scheme and having different colors dominate his different
modes. However, his head sculpt and taller, serious-looking demeanor in
robot mode don't really fit what his personality has become, which is unfortunate
as it's a pretty nice redeco. I'd still recommend this toy, just... repurposing
it as someone else is probably better if you're at all familiar with his
comic personality.

       Swerve is a genius, but you wouldn't
know it to watch him drive. He's often so preoccupied by the analysis of
whatever material he's been given that he completely loses track of where
he is or where he's going. When he's not working on a tough problem, it's
not uncommon for him to wander aimlessly into the middle of a battle.
