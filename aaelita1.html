    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Chromia.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen
Chromia

     At long last, the last
of the three biker sisters from Revenge of the Fallen gets a toy! Only...
it's just a repaint of Chromia. Although they were both motorcycles, Elita-1
was most definitely an entirely different design from Chromia in the movie,
and it really irks me that she's relegated to a repaint when she had a
different design commissioned. Putting that aside-- well, even the COLORS
are wrong. Elita-1's design in the movie was mostly purple-- this one clearly
isn't. Again, really bad move. Beyond that fact that she has the same face
as the other Biker Sisters (like she's supposed to), an unusual robot body
structure, and that she's a motorcycle, there isn't anything this toy has
in common with the Elita-1 movie design. It's a shame, because it really
colors my appreciation of the toy. I mean, the color scheme itself is fairly
nice-- the black/silver/light gray color combo is a bit overdone, but the
really nice pale metallic pinkish purple contrasts extremely well with
the other colors. It really makes the color scheme, in my opinion, which
is why I wish there was more of it-- particularly near the back half of
the vehicle mode or below the waist in robot mode. From some angles, it's
still a bit too "two-tone" with the black and silver/gray being a little
too dominant. The transparent dark blue plastic also helps to give the
scheme a bit more color, though it's used so rarely it really doesn't mattter
much in the grand (color) scheme of things. Elita-1 has a couple of nice
silver "Cyberglyphic" paint apps that help at least a little to match her
up with her sisters, but otherwise there really isnt any purely decorative
paint apps in terms of those that aren't pinkish purple. (One nice little
nod is that her license plate reads "3L 174", a "133t" play on Elita's
name.)

     Autobot Alliance Elita-1
is a decent enough repaint-- roughly on par with this mold's previous usage
as Chromia, just judging the mold and color scheme by itself. Unfortunately,
it completely falls flat at representing the character it's supposed to,
being a repaint of another character when it was supposed to be a completely
original design, and has the wrong colors compared to the movie model to
boot. Such a wasted opportunity...

       Though she is a sister to Arcee, Elita-1
has more in common with Sideswipe. She and the swordsman team up whenever
possible-- especially if it means they can get away somewhere nice to do
a little Decepticon hunting. This time, the two Autobots have found themselves
up against Axor, who should present just enough of a challenge to make
things interesting.
