    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Deluxe Prowl.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe 2.0 Deluxe

     Like the
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      G1
character
     </a>
     , Silverstreak here is a repaint and slight remold of Prowl,
and like the G1 character, his color scheme is dynamite. Silver, black,
and red is a pretty color scheme no matter what toy you put it on, and
Universe 2.0 Silverstreak is no exception. In vehicle mode in particular,
his colors pop, since most of the gray plastic in his vehicle mode is actually
painted a very attractive shade of metallic silver as opposed to being
dull unpainted gray plastic. All that silver goes perfectly with the painted
black and the transparent blue windows. On the flip side, many of his exposed
bits in robot mode are the aforementioned gray, but this is likely done
so that the paint doesn't scratch much during transformation. He doesn't
have many colors that are solely used for accent colors, but the few he
does have-- like the sky blue bits on his waist and the light red on his
headlights-- look really sharp and contrast well with the surrounding colors.

     Universe 2.0 Silverstreak
has one mold change-- Prowl's siren has been removed, so Silverstreak's
just a normal police car. Other than that, he's the same as Prowl.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Silverstreak
is a fantastic repaint, and a few of the mold's shortcomings are the only
thing that keep it from getting a 9.0+ rating. Still, I really have no
complaints about his very eye-catching, dynamic color scheme, and I'd definitely
recommend this toy the most out of the three color schemes this mold has
received.

       There's not a lot to be said about Silverstreak
that he hasn't already said himself. In fact, there's not a lot to be said
about anything that he hasn't already said, becuase he never stops talking.
Ever. He talks to his partners on guard duty. He talks during his charge
cycles. When he's alone, he talks to himself. In battle, he chats with
his opponent. Despite his formidable weaponry, Decepticons prefer not to
fight him mostly because they get sick of talking to him.
