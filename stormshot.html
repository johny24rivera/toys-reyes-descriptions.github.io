    Stormshot's alternate
mode is a jet. As you'd expect from a RID2015 toy, it's a bit stylized/"kiddie-fied",
but I think Stormshot goes a bit too far (at least in this mode). He looks
like he'd fit in with the Rescue Bots line of toys, honestly. I'm not sure
what it is-- the fairly soft curves, the rather primary colors, the wide
nosecone-- but it just looks a bit TOO "friendly" for a jet. Anyways, that
aside, this jet mode is like a lot of Transformer jet modes in that there's
a bit of kibble underneath-- most notably, the robot arms that poke out
blatantly underneath the main wings, particularly popping out the front.
They're sorta "disguised" as engines due to the mold detailing near the
front, but it's not really convincing-- and the turbines don't look nearly
"complete" either, as they're a bit open due to the articulation needed
to move down those shoulders for the transformation. On a lesser note,
the robot feet are fairly obvious on the back end, and the robot head and
body poke out a bit more from the underside than they should, though they
aren't visible from most normal angles in this mode. Stormshot does have
a fold-out landing gear piece that helps keep him level, though. Ignoring
these issues, the rest of Stormshot's vehicle mode looks pretty solid,
keeping in mind the aforementioned caveat about his overall look. He's
got a wide, fairly flat nosecone with cockpit windows detailed in; rather
unremarkable but decent wings; and small vertical tailfins and regular-sized
horizontal ones. Compared to most RID2015 designs, he's got an above-average
amount of mold detailing, with several angled designs on his wings, as
well as some horizontal lines and panels on the top of his nosecone and
back end. The color scheme is pretty straightforward, being red, white,
and blue, for the most part. All of his white is a "pure" white, and his
red is painted on, being a fairly neutral shade of the color. The blue,
however, is three different shades. All of his blue plastic is a rather
dark, flat, almost navy blue, but oddly with some glitter in it, which
helps offset some of that dull-ness. Most of the blue paint in this mode
is of a metallic dark shade, and looks pretty nice. For just the cockpit,
there's some moderately light glossy blue, which is spot-on for a cockpit
window color. Stormshot has two weapons, both of them black; a short, sawed-off
gun and a larger gun with a longer barrel. Both can be cobined to form
a rifle-like gun. There's several storage options; there's a port for the
weapons under each wing, as well as a port on the top middle of this mode.
You can also store the gun underneath the nosecone, though it looks better
if you have them both combined when you plug it in down there.

    Stormshot mostly transforms
like a
    <a href="cwskydive.html">
     Combiner Wars Aerialbot
    </a>
    , but with the
combiner aspect obviously removed; the arms fold out from the sides and
down, the legs fold and extend out from the back end, and the nosecone
fits on his back. The only remotely original aspect of his transformation
is that his wings do a little flip for this mode, but otherwise it's very
much "been there, done that". Anyways, in robot mode Stormshot looks pretty
good overall, and less overly "kiddy" compared to his jet mode. Silhouette-wise,
he's not really original, with the wings behind him and the nosecone sticking
up a little behind his upper back like a lot of jet TFs, while his wings
have the tailfins hanging off them. I would not consider this kibble given
that it accentuates the look of the mode; it's just not original. There's
several cool details on Stormshot's chest, like some asymmetrical detaiiling
on the pecs with two straight lines and an angular one on one side, while
the other has his Autobot scan symbol; right below both are what look like
intake vents. He's got a somewhat trim stomach, and angular interlocking
armor bits around the waist that look like they'd belong on most other
RID2015 toys. I also like the high curved spikes to the sides of his head;
they make him look a little more unique, at least. His head itself seems
like an amalgamation of a lot of Aerialbot TFs' heads, with a a red angular
visor, a white angular paint app above said visor, a silver "normal" face,
and more red on the center forehead spike, with the rest of his blue head
having small side antennae and vents on the sides of his chin. Beyond the
aforementioned engine details on his shoulders, Stormshot's appendages
don't have much more than the bare minimal mold detailing on them; rather,
the paint apps are what help distinguish his limbs. His lower arms have
a nice blue/red combo with a white diagonal line separating the colors,
while his lower legs switch between white and blue, with red spiky knees
and white below said knees. Really, add this to the red and blue on the
chest, as well as a bit of metallic black on the abs and the added amount
of black on the appendages, and Stormshot really does have quite a lot
of paint on him-- this is the best part about the toy, I'd venture to say.
There's no large portion that's remotely lacking any real paint. For articulation,
he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
inwards at the wrists, and movement at the hips (at two points) and knees.
Although I wish he had waist rotation-- there's nothing in his transformation
that would prevent it-- otherwise he's quite articulated, and well-balanced
to boot.

    RID2015 Stormshot isn't
a BAD toy by any means, he's just rather boring and very unneeded. There's
all these amazing Decepticon designs from the show that never got any toys
at all, and here one of the Warrior class slots is taken up by a jet Transformer
that wasn't in the show and doesn't really have anything unique about his
design. He does have an impressive number of paint apps, great robot mode
proportions and articulation, and a decent (albeit overly kiddy) jet mode,
but I would MUCH have rather his slot have gone to one of the many great
Decepticon designs that never got a toy instead.
