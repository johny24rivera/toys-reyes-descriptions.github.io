    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Sledge. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Sledge

     Bonecrusher's color scheme
is fitting for a construction vehicle, I'll at least give him that. However,
that doesn't mean it looks good. The brown itself, along with the minor
colors like metallic gunmetal gray and bronze, I have no problems with.
The yellow, though, I have a big problem with-- it's a gaudy, glossy shade
of yellow, and really does not serve to make the figure look appetizing
at all. Plus, most of the yellow paint apps seem to just almost coat an
entire plastic piece instead of actually being good paint detailing-- like
on his legs on the inside of his shovel, for example. Sledge had some really
good detailing, like the pipes in the middle of his legs, but now it's
all just one big blob of yellow paint. So even though Bonecrusher has the
same number of, if not more, paint apps than his predecessor, he looks
sloppier than Sledge does. The gray I don't have as big a problem with
as the yellow, but it is a somewhat ugly shade of gray, as it's halfway
between gray and tan, and without any color wash to make it look faded
or anything, it doesn't come off looking very appetizing. The transparent
blue Energon parts also tend to clash with the gray and brown colors, as
well.

     No mold changes have
been made to Bonecrusher, although he does have a new blue Powerlinx symbol
on the inside of his shovel, whereas most of the Sledges had no such symbol.

     Bonecrusher is still
a good mold, but his color scheme could have been much, much better. The
gray and the yellow just do not work with this toy. So I'd easily recommend
Sledge over this guy, if you only want one of the mold.
