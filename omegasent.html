    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Omega Supreme.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Omega Supreme

     Boy, I tells ya, the
repaints of the Supreme-sized toys just completely blow their previous
versions out of the water-- it's almost enough to make me wait through
the first version and just buy the second one. (
     <i>
      Almost
     </i>
     being the
main qualifier, there.) Omega Sentinel just gives Omega Supreme a royal
beatdown in the color scheme department-- he looks fantastic. For one,
the robot mode is no longer a mish-mash of two differently colored vehicles--
now both of the vehicles have the same general colors on them, so it makes
for a much more unified robot mode. As for the color scheme-- black, silver,
and orange/red just look so slagging GOOD on this toy. It's a bit of a
nod back to G1 Omega Sentinel, who were basically sparkless guardians of
Cybertron, led by Omega Supreme. The G1 Omega Sentinels looked just like
Omega Supreme, and had a similar color scheme to Energon Omega Sentinel
here. But Energon Omega Sentinel here improves on his predecessors a little
by adding in more orange and red for some good contrast. And it all works
incredibly well-- the scheme is certainly less kiddy than Omega Supreme's,
and gives the toy a more serious look. Omega Sentinel's also got boatloads
of paint apps-- tons on his arms and chest, especially. My only real complaint
is that the eyes on the secondary head-- seen once you take off the Headmaster
in robot mode-- aren't painted on Sentinel. It's a shame, because I think
that that little bitty head was a really cool idea, and now it just looks
like a lifeless stump without any paint on it. Also, although the robot
head still looks cool, the transparent blue plastic over a solid orange
face doesn't work as well as the transparent red plastic over Omega Supreme's
face did. Omega Sentinel's Headmaster part, being a combination of orange,
silver, and red, looks a little better and more interesting than Omega
Supreme's Headmaster, however.

     Omega Sentinel is a
fantastic, well-thought-out repaint, and puts the toy within spitting distance
of the "must-buy" category of 9.0 or above, though some of the flaws in
the mold, detailed in Omega Supreme's review, keep it from reaching that
point. Still a pretty good toy, though. Recommended over Omega Supreme.

       Omega Sentinel, like Omega Supreme,
is one of the legendary Guardians of Cybertron. He is commander of the
Guardians, who feels that his only purpose is to protect and defend. His
primary programming has made him a stoic figure devoid of emotion. He will
analyze a battle situation using logic and, when necessary, brute strength.
Although Omega Sentinel is highly respected by his fellow Guardians, he
is often classified as boring and overly-technical. He believes that these
qualities are a tactical key to victory when battling the Decepticon forces.
