    Optimus Prime's futuristic
truck-and-trailer vehicle mode is replicated fairly well for this larger
simplified toy of him, though the cab is perhaps a bit small proportionally
in comparison to the trailer-- just a BIT, though. There are a few oddities/extras,
though, as you'd expect from a simplified toy; the robot feet are fairly
obvious on the front of the trailer, and there's no real back end to the
truck-- just the tops of the robot shoulders and nothing really underneath
them; no taillights or anything of the sort. The hands are SLIGHTLY obvious,
though they're a little hidden on the top underneath little protrusions
that become Prime's kneecaps in robot mode. Otherwise this mode looks pretty
good overall (though I wish there was some kind of clip to lightly connect
the pieces at the back; it's difficult to get the two halves to line up
correctly). I love the stylized look of the truck, especially on the cab,
which has all kinds of angular lines on the windows and a rather aggressive-looking
grill. The mold detailing is otherwise fairly minimal, with the usual RID2015
divots and bare-bones lines here and there-- the tires are surprisingly
well-detailed, however, with a good amount of treaded detailing. There's
even little side doors molded onto the stylized truck cab, which I did
not expect. For the color scheme, it's your typical Optimus red and dark
blue, though the shades for each have a bit of a glittery swirl in them,
making them look semi-metallic-- a decision I wholeheartedly approve of.
What is odd is that there's a bit of darker red, though-- mostly used for
some parts in the transformation that aren't easily visible in either mode,
EXCEPT for on the top of the cab roof (and parts of the shoulders in robot
mode)-- not sure what's up with that, as it clashes with the lighter red
surrounding it a bit. For paint apps, there's some red lines along the
side of the trailer to help break up all that dark blue, and some really
nice light blue "circuitry-style" details near the front sides-- I wish
these details had been used on the toy a bit more, honestly. Most of the
windows are painted a nice metallic black, with the silver bumper and grill
painted silver, and with light blue headlights. As a whole it generally
looks pretty good, except for the top of the trailer-- there really isn't
any paint there, so there's way too much unbroken dark blue.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
is ingenious, and honestly rather fun-- you unpeg the cab portion, rotate
it all the way downwards in a semi-circle below the trailer and have it
"break through" the top of the back of the trailer, folding down the front
of the cab section as you do so. The head reveal, moving of the shoulders
outwards, and lengthening and slight spreading of the legs are all automatic
as you accomplish this motion. Everything clicks into place quite solidily,
and thus this is perfect for younger kids in terms of transformation. In
general Optimus looks pretty good in this mode-- at least from the front.
If you look at him from the side, you can see all eight of his tires just
hanging off the back there, which is a bit unsightly though not an absolutely
huge issue. The arms are very nicely proportioned and quite close to the
show, with the only real issue being that the middle portions are a bit
too short (though they are painted silver). The head is all done marvelously
well, with accurate detailing on the face, along with silver on the vents
and faceplate and some moderately light blue for the eyes. The faux "truck
sides" molded onto the sides of the chest and the way the truck cab folds
up make for an excellent chest (particuarly for a more simplistic toy such
as this). The skirt is well-detailed, though the legs are bit weaker. Proportionally,
they're pretty well-done, though again they're lacking paint detailing
and Optimus basically has a "uni-leg"; this is more acceptable on smaller
toys, but on a toy this large I don't like this; having the lower legs
angle to opposite sides, but with plenty of obvious pieces connecting them
down there, doesn't look nearly as good as if they were actually separate.
A connector piece also hangs down between his upper legs, which is also
unsightly-- same with the sides of the vehicle on the sides of his main
body. The upper legs bring a new color into the mix-- a milky gray-- but
thankfully it's the same semi-metallic shade as most of the rest of the
toy, so I don't mind it when used in such small amounts. The light blue
little "divots" on the shoulders are it as far as new paint apps beyond
the face and middle of the arms, though. For articulation, Optimus can
move back-and-forth at the shoulders-- that's it. Even though articulation
isn't the point of these toys, I kinda wish there had been elbow articulation
of some sort, as there's nothing in the transformation preventing that.

Optimus Prime does have a few issues worth noting-- such as the "uni-leg"
in robot mode, the obvious wheel kibble on the sides, and to a lesser extent
the very obvious feet in vehicle mode-- but overall he's a solid, proportional
toy in both modes with a fun transformation that's probably one of the
best choices you can make for a young kid who wants a toy of this design.
