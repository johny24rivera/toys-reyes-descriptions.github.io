    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe RotF
Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original deluxe RotF Sideswipe toy

     Aaand here's
     <i>
      Sideswipe's
     </i>
     mainline "slightly-repainted-just-to-keep-him-on-the-shelves" toy. The
basic-- and rather bland-- Sideswipe color scheme of gray and black is
intact, though thankfully with that sweet, sweet silver paint all over
his vehicle mode. There are only two major changes made to Sideswipe's
paint job this time around. First, three black stripe designs have been
added to his vehicle mode (one on each side and one in the center of the
roof), which add a bit more contrast to the vehicle mode and look quite
good-- the side stripes also have the N.E.S.T. Global Alliance logo on
them, which is a nice touch too. The only other major change is that Sideswipe's
transparent plastic is now red instead of blue. Red, of course,
     <i>
      works
     </i>
     with silver and black, since the latter two are neutral colors, but I think
the blue transparent plastic on the original deluxe is a tiny bit better--
more "Autobot-y", if you will.

     Strike Mission Sideswipe
is an okay repaint, but I don't really have strong feelings towards the
slight color changes one way or the other. I like the black racing stripes
a little, but dislike the change of the transparent plastic to red pretty
much equally. So whichever version you can find which fits your personal
fancy more, get, though this version isn't nearly different enough from
the original to justify getting both.

       Sideswipe is used to working alone,
but he's enough of a team player to recognize that younger Autobots can
benefit from his experience. What Mudflap thinks is a simple race is actually
a training exercise. Sideswipe intends to put the young warrior through
his paces, teaching him everything there is to know about offensive driving.
