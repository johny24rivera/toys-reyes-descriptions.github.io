    Nice to see that the
Titanium line is paying tribute to pretty much all the past Transformers
line-- if any line would've been passed over, I figured it would have been
the rather controversial Beast Machines line, but nope, Cheetor in his
Beast Machines form has been redone for the Titanium line. And man, does
he looks sleek-- more so than any of his other Beast Machines toys, to
be sure. In beast mode, Cheetor shares quite a big similarity to his Beast
Machines self, in terms of overall super-sleek style and proportions, but
also in terms of the colors, right down to the purple cheetah spots dotted
all over his back and upper appendages. They look really nice against the
semi-metallic shade of yellowish gold, too. The green and red also blend
in nicely with the other colors, though perhaps making them just a shade
or two darker would've helped to add a bit more contrast to the toy. What
is different when compared to the other Beast Machines toys, however, is
that Cheetor has very little technorganic mold detailing on him-- he looks
like a purely mechanical cheetah. I'm not sure why this was done, but it
still looks pretty cool regardless, and helps give Cheetor a bit of a "new
look" while stil retaining the essential elements of his Beast Machines
self. The proportions are a bit off in this mode when compared to an actual
cheetah, but most of this was likely intentional, due to the scrawny alien-esque
appearance of many of the Beast Machines Maximals. (And on a side note,
hooray for finally getting an actual Maximal symbol on Cheetor's display
stand-- I wish the same could have been said for
    <a href="titanoptimal.html">
     Optimal
Optimus
    </a>
    .) Cheetor's head is pretty small proportionally, while his
lower front legs are skinny and his upper front legs are bulky. This actually
fits in with the overall aesthetic, however, and honestly probably looks
better than if the proportions were more normal. I'm not fond of the back
legs, however-- they're far too long in comparison to the front, and the
swords are a bit too obvious on the sides, though at least they fit in
with the overall shape of the legs. Also, since the swords are made of
the bendy plastic necessary for such thin plastic parts, I worry about
them warping a lot over time because of repeated sliding-on and taking-off
of the upper leg pegs. Cheetor's cheetah head can rotate from side to side
at the base of the head, but that's the only unique point of articulation--
the other points he shares with his robot mode, which I'll get to shortly.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    First off, a quick but
important warning about Cheetor's transformation--
    <b>
     when transforming
him from robot mode back into cheetah mode, MAKE SURE you push the robot
head back INTO the upper beck piece before rotating the cheetah head piece
upwards
    </b>
    . Otherwise Cheetor's robot head will be stuck inside the chest
when you try to transform him again, and nothing short of disassembling
the entire chest will get the head out again. Now, as for the actual robot
mode-- it's definitely very much Beast Machines Cheetor, but it's considerably
bulkier in appearance, increasing the stability of the design. The legs
also don't bend backwards at the knees nearly as much-- again, for stability.
It looks good, however, and fits Cheetor surprisingly well. The swords
look great in his hands are make good-sized weapons, and the usage of the
beast paws as the heels for the robot feet help stability even more. And,
given that Cheetor has great articulation-- he can move at the head, shoulders,
elbows, hips, and knees-- you can get a pretty good amount of poses out
of him because of this. What is a big bummer, and one of Titanium Cheetor's
biggest flaws, is that his arms cannot rotate upwards at the elbows at
all without having the lower beast legs swing down from behind the shoulders
as well, since the lower robot arms and the lower front beast legs are
the same piece of plastic and rotate on the same hinge. This is especially
bad in beast mode, as conversely Cheetor can't lift up his front legs at
all without having the back halves of his upper legs swing down to reveal
the robot arms at the same time. On a lesser note, I'm also a bit dissapointed
that nothing was done with Cheetor's tail in robot mode-- simply folding
it up onto the back would have sufficed, but it can't move at all and just
hangs between his legs here. Also, I'm not too fond of Cheetor's robot
head sculpt-- it has the necessary "Cheetor" characteristics, but the upper
head is large to the point of making him look like he has a massively oversized
brain and head doesn't extend as far "back" as it should, instead having
more normal head proportions in terms of its width compared to its height,
which is not how Beast Machines Cheetor's head is supposed to look. Also,
much of the back of the head is painted green, when it should be yellow-ish
gold like most of the rest of the figure. On the plus side, however, at
least the beast head tucks in very nicely behind the back and out of the
way in this mode. In case you're wondering, Cheetor's diecast parts are
his upper arms, chest, and upper legs.

    Titanium Cheetor is
the best version of Beast Machines Cheetor released, and an above-average
Titanium, but he still suffers from a few flaws-- namely, a few proportional
problems, odd problems with his arm articulation, and an overly simplstic
transformation that is part of the overall Beast Machines design. He's
still a fine toy, though, and looks great in most respects. Mildly recommended.

      Like every young Autobot and Maximal
speedster before and since, Cheetor was once a study in naivet√©.
Years of bitter experience in the Beast Wars have left him hardened, without
the bright-eyed curiosity that caused him and the other Maximal warriors
so many problems. Seeing Cybertron under the thumb of Megatron and its
population enslaved has left him grim, nearly crushing the former good
humor out of his spirit. He has turned every bit the predator, and focused
all of his energies on the liberation of his fellow robots.

      The conversion of Optimus Primal into
some kind of strange religious fanatic by the Oracle has done nothing to
help. Cheetor believes in his friend and leader, but the word of a mythical
computer is not enough for him to go on a crusade. For Cheetor, the liberation
of the sparks of the citizens of Cybertron is all that really matters.
While Optimus Primal is distracted by prophecies and spirit-quests, Cheetor
is forced to step into the unlooked for role of leader in the hope of bringing
about the salvation of his kind.
