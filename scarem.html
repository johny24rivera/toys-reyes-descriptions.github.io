    Beast mode is a beetle
with enourmous jaws. Although looking seriously abnormal, he looks fierce
and cool at the same time, like most of the other Transmetals 2. This is
one of the few insects that can stand up on its insect legs in its beast
mode. One of the side effects to this, however, is that the legs are oddly
jointed, but this is no big loss. The wings, although separate pieces,
cannot open in this mode, because of the way that this toy is built.

    His robot mode is seriously
fierce. Although his name could be better, his arms are like mantis claws
and his face is extremely detailed. His legs look kind of weird, though,
since they are two of his insect legs connected together. However, you
can also split his legs apart so it looks like he has four legs. His shoulder
blades are enourmous in this mode, but they don't get in the way much.
His spark orb is located under a panel in his chest.

    A good transformer,
although he is slightly deformed in beast mode.

      Megatrons cloning experiments have
added a new and sinister member to the Predacon ranks: Scarem. A cold,
calculating, cyber-organic beetle, Scarem can travel at extremely high
speeds over any type of terrain - even when upside-down. His body shell
withstands an incredible amount of firepower. When on the attack, Scarems
ultra aggressive fighting methods are nearly impossible to stop. Now, the
Maximals must use everything at their disposal to stop the vicious assault
of Scarem.
