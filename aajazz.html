    "Classics" Jazz at a
deluxe scale finally gets made-- oh happy day! In vehicle mode, he's about
as Porsche-like as you can get without being an actual Porsche (and having
a significantly smaller spoiler). This mode looks quite nice, and very
smooth-looking-- as Jazz should be. There's no proportional problems at
all, and the only robot mode kibble is barely visible inside the transparent
blue windshield. The mold detailing is rather minimal, but adding a lot
of it would have ruined the curvy look of the mode, so I can understand
why that was done. It's also particularly apparent with this toy that it's
meant to mimic the "G1 cartoon" feel of him more than anything else, which
gives a bit more justification to this decision. The blue-and-red stripes
down the middle and sides of the vehicle mode help to bring a little pop
to the otherwise fairly straightforward white/black/gray color scheme,
and are quite eye-catching. There's also "4" numbers on the car doors and
front hood, another little homage to his
    <a href="jazz.html">
     G1 self
    </a>
    .
That said, there could definitely be some more paint apps added to this
mode; the back end is missing paint for the taillights, rear window, and
tailpipes, which is a bit of a shame given how well the rest of him is
painted. Jazz has a really cool gimmick that can be deployed in either
this mode or his robot mode-- his car doors can open and flip out (relatively)
giant speakers, which of course not only fits his character perfectly,
but was also used in the G1 cartoon. That's just a REALLY nice nod and
helps add more personality to the toy. Like other "Reveal the Shield" toys,
Jazz has a black symbol which you can rub to reveal his allegiance (Autobot,
of course); on this toy it's in the middle of the stripes on his roof.

    Jazz' transformation
is also nearly identical to his G1 toy, but slightly more complex and with,
of course, considerably more articulation and better proportions. Really,
taking into mind the aforementioned "curvy, G1 cartoon" aesthetic the toy's
going for, this mode is pretty near perfect. His head is perhaps a TAD
small, but that's about the only complaints I have regarding his proportions
(and the headsculpt is great and crisp, so no complaints about the head
otherwise). The way his vehicle mode bits either fold against, integrate
into, or frame his robot parts are all just really well done. Jazz' "door
wings" enhance the mode, rather than detract from it (particularly when
you consider the fold-out speakers on them). The front wheels make great
shoulder pads, to boot. The mold detailing is a bit more prevalent on his
"robot parts", though it's still relatively sparse compared to most other
toys from the line-- again, almost certainly a deliberate choice to keep
him looking more like he leapt out of the G1 cartoon show. His signature
blaster folds out from under the front of his vehicle mode and can be held
easily (and snugly) in either of his hands. His articulation is also great;
he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
wrists, waist, hips (at three points), knees (at two points), and ankles
(at two points). Really, any point of movement you could reasonably ask
for on a toy of this size is there, though it should be mentioned the waist
movement is a bit restricted normally because of the roof piece on Jazz'
back. There are only really two complaints I have about Jazz in this mode--
firstly, and most annoyingly, his chest doesn't have any clip or peg to
hold it in place. Thus, when you turn his arms up (most often at the shoulders,
which are fairly tight joints), his chest will have a tendency to lift
up as well (and his head to turn down, as they're both pieces tied together
during the transformation). That's rather aggravating given that there's
no real reason why a small tab couldn't have worked there. On a lesser
note, it's also a bit difficult to get the halves of the rear of his car
mode to get into just that right angle that they look "right" on the lower
legs, given that there's no definite angle that they lock into relative
to the other pieces.

    Special Ops Jazz is
a fantastic mold, and a great update to a great character. The neat flip-out
speakers are just a bonus to such a well-engineered, well-proportioned,
and well-articulated toy. The lack of his chest locking into any sort of
set position in robot mode is a bit annoying, though, and no paint on his
rear end in vehicle mode is also a slight eyesore; other than that, there's
not much to keep me from wholeheartedly recommending him.

      Autobot Jazz falls in love with every
world he visits. The tiniest hint of alien culture is enough to fascinate
him for hours. His ability to immerse himself in a new civilization makes
him an ideal undercover agent-- he blends in with the environment, absorbing
every bit of data he can, and looks for the anomaly that tells him Decepticons
are present.
