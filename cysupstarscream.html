    First off, before I start
the review, a bit of background info is needed on this toy. Supreme Starscream
is not the "default" size of this mold-- the normal size was a Voyager-class
toy, released in the Japanese version of the Cybertron line, Galaxy Force.
Supreme Starscream is a large-scale version of the same mold, with a few
relatively minor modifications. Since I'll be referring to the Galaxy Force
"normal-sized" version several times in this review, I thought it'd be
good to clear that up first.

    Starscream's vehicle
mode is a highly futuristic jet, which is meant to be a nod to how G1 Starscream
looked in his alternate mode before he was reformatted on Earth. However,
most kids probably won't notice this, and overall, Starscream looks like
a diamond-shaped big hunk of metal with a cockpit and a few wings. The
body of the plane is FAR too large to even picture this thing being able
to fly, especially when compared with the relatively miniscule wings. If
the huge lower robot legs weren't off to the sides of the cockpit section,
it would have made this mode look significantly more streamlined-- though
I'm not sure where the legs could have gone on a jet shaped like this anyways...
And also, some of the flaws that were only minor in the Voyager-sized Galaxy
Force version are magnified here because of the sheer size of the mold;
the rear wings being noticeably higher than the parts directly in front
of them, as well as the two not connecting together in some way; the hollow
rear wing; and the rather visible robot head between the rear missile launchers.
The mold detailing is also the same as the Galaxy Force on 95% of the toy,
which at this scale, means Starscream looks a bit underdetailed on certain
parts. The paitn detailing is likewise rather simplistic, with almost no
small paint apps, but at least the overall color scheme is nice-- the metallic
red looks really cool, and the gray and black are, as always, Starscream-y
colors. A bit of purple is thrown in for good measure, though a bit of
blue on the wings or legs would've helped to break up all the gray a bit
more. There are a few features in this mode that aren't on the smaller
version as well; the (non-firing, alas) guns to the sides of the cockpit
can move up and down, and if you press the small red piece sticking out
of the top of the left rear missile launcher, a firing sound is heard as
the launchers blink on and off. However, I would've REALLY liked to have
seen Hasbro take full advantage of making Starscream so big by making the
roof the cockpit flip open, and being able to fit a Minicon in there by
deepening the cockpit just a little bit. But no such luck.

    Starscream's robot mode
looks great, and even though it's simplistic, it still manages to look
imposing on such a big scale. A few words about the transformation; however;
it's very hard to unfold the robot legs without accidentally popping off
half of the wings, which is rather annoying. Also, a portion of the nosecone
folds away so it doesn't protrude too much from his waist in this mode,
while the smaller version doesn't have this extra step. The rear wings
also turn in a little big when you fold them down on Starscream's upper
back-- this helps to make them less obvious in this mode, a feature which
the smaller version also doesn't have. Starscream's proportions are pretty
good, except for his arms, which could stand to be a tad longer. But what's
really cool about this robot mode, however, is that it's a big HONKING
nod to Dreamwave's War Within (pre-G1) Starscream, to the point where it
looks almost identical in this mode! It's a really, really cool fan nod.
Starscream's articulation is decent-- he can move at the head; shoulders,
elbows, hips (at two points), and knees (at two points). You can get a
reasonable number of poses out of him, but at such a large scale, modifications
to give him more arm articulation (which is limited at both the shoulders
and elbows), or to give him individual finger articulation, would have
made the toy more desirable here. Supreme Starscream, unlike the normal-sized
Starscream, comes with a Decepticon Crown of Leadership, which looks almost
exactly like the crown Starscream was wearing in the '80s movie-- another
huge fan nod. Unfortunately, there's nowhere to really store it in his
vehicle mode without it being blatantly apparent. Also, instead of one
Cyber Key activating both his arms as on the smaller version, Starscream
has TWO Cyber Keys-- a "normal" Decepticon one and a golden Earth one--
to activate each arm gimmick separately. There's also a slot on his back
where you can store one Cyber Key when it's not in use. When his right
arm is activated, a sword pops out-- swing said arm up above his head,
and a "sword clinging" sound is made while his launchers light up red and
his eyes light up green. It's rather lame, as EVERY time you raise Starscream's
arm above that point, the sound is made-- I would have MUCH preferred the
sound just coming on when you activated the gimmick. As for his left arm,
a futuristic blaster swings out, which can fire a missile, which also makes
small claws on the side of the gun pop up as you do so-- a rather cool
effect. When you raise this arm up past the head, it makes another "firing"
noise as the missile launchers light up-- though I have the same complaints
with this sound as I do with the one on the other arm.

    Starscream has a very
cool robot mode, and is decent enough, but he's just FAR too simplistic
to warrant getting a Supreme-sized toy made out of what is clearly a Voyager-sized
mold. He has a couple of small modifications and gimmicks made to try to
justify this, but it's not nearly enough-- more mold and paint detailing,
an openable cockpit, and better articulation would have made the toy at
this size more appetizing, among other things. Unless you're a completist
or just really REALLY like Starscream, I'd stick with ordering the Galaxy
Force version (it's cheaper, even though it's from Japan, since it's a
normal Voyager size), or sufficing for the Legends of Cybertron version.
Starscream just doesn't offer enough bang for the buck as a toy of this
size-- if only he was smaller, he'd have gotten a substantially higher
rating.

      Unsurpassed in ego or ambition, Starscream
is the scheming second-in-command to Megatron. With his mastery of the
sword, null-ray cannons that can disrupt the functioning of even the most
hardened Autobot and a vast array of secondary weapons, Starscream is second
only to Megatron and Optimus Prime in power. His speed is uncanny, often
giving slower Â‘bots the impression that he actually teleports across the
battlefield.
