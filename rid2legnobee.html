    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 legion Bumblebee

     You can't have a new
RID Bumblebee mold without a "reverse deco" repaint, and so here's the
Legion class version of Bumblebee where the primary color is black and
yellow is only an accent color. If you've been paying attention to my reviews
on these kind of color schemes, it shouldn't surprise you at all that I
like this deco considerably more than "normal" Bumblebee. The black just
works much better as a main color instead of yellow, in my opinion. I do
appreciate that this isn't a simple "color swap", though-- as opposed to
the original RID2015 legion 'Bee toy, this one actually has stripes-- yellow
stripes, on the roof and hood of the vehicle mode. It really looks nice,
but what looks even nicer is the lovely shade of blue used for the headlights
and all of the car windows except the rear window (which is sadly unpainted).
It's a very cool shade that pops especially against the black. In robot
mode you can see a fair bit of a rather blah light milky gray plastic (which
is also used on the tires)-- I'm not a big fan of this shade, but it's
mostly used on small and/or connector parts, so it's not a big downside.
The upper legs, at least, are unnecessarily but thankfully painted silver,
which looks much better. Bumblebee's head is also painted silver with little
blue eyes, and looks quite good.

     The legion class version
of Night Ops Bumblebee has a pretty nice color scheme, with some great
paint apps in vehicle mode in particular. I could've done without the milky
gray parts in robot mode, and the mold still has a bit of an awkward robot
mode, but this is definitely the best version of this mold.
