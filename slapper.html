    Mold History
   </b>
   : Slapper's mold was
originally used for the Beast Wars Transmetal 2 version of Spittor, which
came out in 1999.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Spittor Transmetal 2. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Spittor Transmetal 2

     Slapper's color scheme
is pretty much the polar opposite of Spittor Transmetal 2's. Whereas Spittor's
main color was blue, Slapper's main color is red. Slapper and Spittor pretty
much have the same amount of paint detailing, although it's more or less
in certain places than with the other- Slapper has more detailing on his
claws and robot face- and THREE different types of chrome plastic on a
basic-sized toy- whereas Spittor has more detailing on his frog face and
his frog back. Both toys are nearly as good as the other, and both color
schemes are great; however, I find Spittor's color scheme slightly more
fitting for a poison arrow frog than I do Slapper's, which is why he gets
a slightly lower rating than his predecessor (8.9 versus 9.1). Many people
has reported some slight problems in the ball joints as well, especially
those that picked up one of the first couple batches released- some say
that their Slapper's joints are too tight, while others say that theirs
is too loose. Personally, my Slapper is just fine, but his robot head panel
doesn't fit that snugly into his chest in robot mode, whereas my Spittor
toy's robot head panel fits just fine. No mold changes were made to this
toy, however, so other than the small problem mentioned above, Slapper's
mold wasn't changed at all from his predecessor's, so all the negatives
and positives are the same mold-wise.

     Slapper is a great toy,
and a great deal, since you get him, Dark Scream, AND Gas Skunk for fifteen
bucks. However, I like the Spittor Transmetal 2 toy slightly more, because
of less ball joint problems and because of the slightly more fitting color
scheme. Still, Slapper's highly recommended.
