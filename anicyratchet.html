    Ol' Ratchet's Cybertron
mode isn't really comparable to a real-life vehicle-- it's sort of a compact
winnebago-like top with four "appendage-treads" that raise it a bit above
the ground. It's certainly an interesting look, and isn't too obviously
just his robot mode in a yoga position like many other "futuristic" modes
past Transformers have had. Still, there's certainly some design cues that
hint at Ratchet's "future" Earth form in this toy-- the windshield/bumper
design, the emergency "heartbeat" symbols on the sides, and of course there's
the fact that his colors are pretty much identical (and in roughly the
same amounts) as they are on his Earth mode toy, which makes my comments
on his colors the same as they were on the original Animated Ratchet toy--
they fit together well enough and they don't look too boring, but they
aren't exactly eye-catching or exciting, either. Ratchet still has the
relatively sparse detailing we've come to expect from Animated toys, but
he's got a tad more than most of the toys in the line-- a few panel lines
here and there help to subtract a little from the "smoothness" of the design
(it's up to you whether that's a positive or a negative-- I consider it
a positive). Some nice "circuitry" detailing is also used on his windshield,
and I like the headlight-bars on the roof-- it helps to break up what would
otherwise be a big flat off-white space. Although for the most part the
proportions in this mode are pretty good, there's one major beef I have--
his upper robot legs and waist hang down VERY blatantly from the rear of
the mode, and almost ruin the otherwise fairly streamlined, futuristic
look this mode has. (His robot arms are also a tad visible from the side,
but they're mostly covered by Ratchet's shock-paddle weapons, which double
as the rear bumper in this mode, so that's really not much of a negative
there.)

    Ratchet's robot mode
is already fairly impressive, but even moreso when you consider how they
took a different alt mode and made it transform into a robot mode with
a very similar design and transformation in many respects. The transformation
is SLIGHTLY more complex than "normal" Ratchet's, but it doesn't look that
way-- his roof's behind his back, he's got the windshield/bumper chest,
shoulder panels, etc. It's also amazing how they slightly modified several
of his features to make him look "younger"-- he's got both of his head
crests, no weird scar-wrinkles on his face, he's actually
    <i>
     smiling
    </i>
    ,
and his chest is designed so that it's a bit wider and more "heroic", as
opposed to "normal" Ratchet's pot-belly. (I particularly think it's ingenious
how both of Ratchet's front treads from vehicle mode slide &amp; collapse
inwards to become his "abs" in this mode.) The "light piping" used for
his optics also works particularly well. In addition, he has the same "EMP
weapon cavity" that his normal version has-- though frustratingly, it still
has the same problem as the original's, in that there's a peg that prevents
you from fitting Lockdown's EMP weapon into the slot snugly. His shoulder
panels are also less cumbersome and more show-accurate due to his transformation,
but be warned-- the right one on mine is very loose and tends to flop around,
so Ratchet's not immune to QA issues. His action feature is also pretty
weak, too-- pressing forward on a lever on his lower right arm causes his
right "shock paddle" to move forward slightly. Um... yay? The shock-paddles
themselves look cool and fit snugly around the hands, though I wish they
had some paint. One last-- small-- complaint I have about this mode is
that given his increased upper body bulk, Ratchet's legs really should
have a bit more mass to them-- particularly the upper legs-- but they don't.
They look a tad too short and skinny proportionally because of this. Ratchet's
articulation is quite good-- he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders,
elbows (at three points), wrists, hips, knees (at three points), and the
ankles. Waist articulation is really the only thing he's missing.

    Cybertron Mode Autobot
Ratchet may not have as much of a recognizable alt mode as the original
Animated toy, but overall I think he's a slightly better toy. He's got
an inventive transformation that still makes both modes look different
yet familiar (particularly the robot mode), some tweaks to make him look
more "youthful", and excellent proportions and articulation. Having his
upper legs and waist just hang off the bottom of the vehicle mode is his
only major drawback. Recommended.

      Back when the war was at its worst,
even the Autobots who weren't programmed to fight were called into battle.
More than once, Autobot Ratchet was forced out onto the battlefield not
just as a medic, but as a warrior. They're not memories he likes to recall,
but he learned more than one lesson that has saved his life in the years
since.
