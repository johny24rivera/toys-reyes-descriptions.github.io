    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Knock Out toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
Knock Out w/ Energon Driller set

     Well, this certainly...
isn't Stinger. It's Prime
     <a href="priknockout.html">
      Knock Out
     </a>
     . I mean,
don't get me wrong, I get it; it's store-exclusive redeco so it normally
doesn't get the budget for a whole new mold, but he's even in Knock Out's
     <i>
      colors
     </i>
     . Why didn't they redeco a Bumblebee toy? Anyways, ignoring
the fact that it looks NOTHING like AoE Stinger beyond being a red car,
taken by itself this toy looks pretty nice. The predominantly red plastic
contrasts with the black plastic and paint apps quite well. Particularly
in car mode, the stripes look great; the wide stripes on the sides look
nice, and the way the stripes on the hood converge make it look like the
car is "angry", especially with the grill painted to make it look a bit
like a frown. Although the front and side windows are painted, however,
the rear window is not-- a common occurrence for car TFs, to be sure, but
one that still annoys me. In robot mode the black is considerably less
dominant, but it's still there, particularly on the midsection. The hips
are the only metallic gunmetal gray paint on the toy; I honestly wish it
was used just a touch more on the toy, perhaps on the arm detailing? There's
also some nice purplish pink paint on the eyes-- not really movie-accurate
either, but it still looks good on a Decepticon, and having the head crest
painted along with "tear lines" down the eyes just looks cool.

     No mold changes have
been made to this mold for AoE Stinger, though this time around this mold
doesn't come with any weapon accessories.

     Taken as a toy by itself,
Stinger is a pretty decent little Legion class toy; the light red and black
go exceptionally well together, and the paint apps are used pretty well
in vehicle mode and on the robot mode face (though a few more paint apps
on the robot mode arms/legs couldn't have hurt). All this said, it's so
very obviously Knock Out and not Stinger at all that I'd only recommend
it for those who are fans of the former character and not the actual character
this toy is described as on the card-- pretend it's "Goth Phase Knock Out"
or something.
