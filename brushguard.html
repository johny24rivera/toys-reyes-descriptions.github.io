    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Overhaul. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Overhaul

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Brushguard, the first
repaint of an earlier Cybertron toy to be released in the line, has a pretty
unique color scheme among Transformers; a pastellish light blue and a dark,
almost blackish purple, with several accent colors mixed in. It's really
not as ugly as it sounds-- the colors actually blend together quite well
in robot mode, and the "blackish" purple especially is a great color for
a Decepticon (which I felt this mold suited better in the first place).
The acidic green, silver, and gray colors also are great accents, and really
blend in well with the toy's major colors. In vehicle mode, however, Brushguard
has far too much of the pastel blue and not enough other colors-- only
a few silver windows and gray accents on the front (plus the same "mountain"
emblem that
     <a href="landquake.html">
      Landquake
     </a>
     had, which I suppose
means he's supposed to be an arctic vehicle-- appropriate, considering
his colors). A few more paint apps in vehicle mode, even at the cost of
some of the robot mode paint apps, really would've helped.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No major mold changes
have been made to Brushguard, just a few minor ones. First off, the Autobot
symbol molded into Overhaul's right shoulder has been removed and instead
replaced with a Decepticon symbol paint app. Also, the Cyber Key has been
changed from a Jungle Key to an Earth Key, though oddly enough, the front
of the Earth Key is painted while the sides aren't. I have absolutely no
idea why.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Brushguard's vehicle
mode is a bit boring when compared to Overhaul's, but I think his robot
mode scheme actually surpasses his predecessor's a little. Additional kudos
for the unique and interesting color scheme. Still, I'd have to recommend
Overhaul slightly over Brushguard.

       One of many scientists working for Megatron,
Brushguard has dedicated his life to xenobotany - the study of alien plant
life. A firm believer in Decepticon supremacy, he hopes to find unique
toxins in Earth plants for use against the Autobots and their human allies.
Though he dislikes violence, he has been retrofitted to fire short-range
bursts of superheated acid from his chest.
