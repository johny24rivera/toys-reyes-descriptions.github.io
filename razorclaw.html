    Beast mode is a sand
crab. A nice-looking mode from the top; however, his robot legs stick out
of the back and make this look like a crab with two little legs. Other
than that major drawback, this mode is pretty good, with nice detailing
and color fading.

    Robot mode has a lot
of extras. His shell part of his crab mode turns into two halves that stick
out, and his crab legs really get in the way and look odd. His crab tail
can hook onto his stomach, but then he cant move his legs very much. His
claws are nice, though, with several spikes in one claw and a laser gun
sticking out of the other.

    A nice transformer,
although the transformation isnt very creative and his beast mode has
two big extras.

    (There is a repaint
of Razorclaw that comes with a Beast Wars video. I am told that this Razorclaw
is just as good, if not better, than the original, mainly because of the
better color scheme.)

      Capable of remaining motionless beneath
a layer of sand, Razorclaw is one of the best quick attack specialists
they've got! When enemies approach his hidden location, his powerful pincer
claw shoots up through the surface to capture and impale victims with the
claw's protruding cyber-spikes! Radar defeating shell armor allows him
to stay cloaked from Maximal sensors. Blaster rifle in (his) secondary
in claw fires disruptor particles, temporarily paralyzing his unsuspecting
prey.
