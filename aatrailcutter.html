    Trailbreaker is now Trailcutter
due to copyright issues- but this toy is still definitely an homage to
G1 Trailbreaker, big time. It's pretty much the exact same 4WD vehicle
mode, with a few minor alterations to make it look a bit more modern and
because of the small scale. Proportionally this mode is excellent, with
no real issues and no robot mode extras, either. The mold detailing on
the figure is about par-for-the-course for a Legends class figure, having
the necessary details when it comes to places like the wheels and headlights,
but not really going "above and beyond the call of duty" because of the
scale. Unfortunately, a lot of Trailcutter's mold details aren't really
apparent, due to his primarily black color scheme and general lack of paint
apps. He has some clustered towards the front of this mode-- the golden
headlights and silver bumper look good-- but other than that, this mode's
barren, which is a shame, as if they had kept a lot of the G1 toy's deco
this toy could've really popped at this scale. The only other paint app
of note is that the front window, which is painted a really dark metallic
blue (not even the side windows are painted!). Unfortunately, this paint
is so dark the light has to be shining almost directly on it for one to
see it stick out from the black. Because Trailcutter is in the "Reveal
the Shield" subline, he has an allegiance rub symbol near the right rear
of this mode-- rub it to reveal he's an Autobot.

    Trailcutter's robot
mode has a few more mold details visible on it, thankfully. His upper legs
are colored silver and light red, and there's enough of it where it contrasts
with the black well enough on the legs and chest. The "missile launcher"
behind Trailcutter's head is also painted silver, and his visor is blue--
but unfortunately, it's the same dark blue as his windshield, so it's hard
to make out. His head sculpt is quite well-done, though. However, the head
is really one of the few good things I can say about this mode when it
comes to its design; it's got pretty doofy proportions all around, even
taking the Legends scale into account. The arms-- which are molded onto
the insides of the rear half of his vehicle mode-- are too short, and with
no discernible elbows look weird. His stomach also sticks out way too much,
and though there's an attempt to cut down on it a bit by having his chest
bend in half, he still looks pretty darned fat. This isn't helped by his
legs either, which are also a bit bulky for the size, and his feet are
huge proportionally. His backside also looks (and is) very hollow. As far
as articulation goes, his is average for a Legend-- he can move at the
shoulders (at two points), hips, and ankles (because of his transformation).

    Trailcutter has a nicely
proportioned vehicle mode and some good mold detailing, but unfortunately
that's about all I can say that's positive about this figure. He has way
too few paint applications, and his proportions in robot mode make him
look overly fat and doofy, even taking into consideration the more simplistic
Legends size class. My least favorite of the "Reveal the Shield" Legends,
easily.
