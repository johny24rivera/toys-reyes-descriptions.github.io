    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM deluxe
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original DotM deluxe Optimus Prime toy

     The "core" toy for this
"Trilogy All-Star" release of Optimus Prime is very nearly the exact same
release as the Wal-Mart exclusive initial solo release of this mold, so
my comments on that part of this toy are minimal. The only real differences
between this toy and said Wal-Mart exclusive are that this one doesn't
have painted wheel rims, the gray on him is a bit darker, the gold on the
truck nose isn't as prominent, and he doesn't have the Mechtech axe weapon
any more-- all but the darker gray negative changes, in my opinion.

     What IS new for this
toy is a very G1-esque trailer, complete with a rather nice dark glittery
blue front and back, silver on the sides, and Autobot symbols on the sides
and front. There's also several Mechtech ports for beefing up Optimus'
trailer with some weaponry-- which is definitely needed this time, considering
he doesn't come with any weapons of his own. The trailer itself can have
the back end fold down for a ramp, and it can just BARELY hold a car deluxe--
anything bigger than that, and it's not going to fit. The trailer can open
up at the side (as seen above), but other than making it a bit easier to
access things you've stored in there, it doesn't really serve any purpose.
No extra trailer-base mode or accessories here; just an open, empty trailer.

     It's a shame the only
toy in the "Movie Trilogy All-Star" segment of the DotM line that actually
saw release was the most mundane. It's just yet another toy of Optimus
Prime with no significant changes made to the core mold, and he comes with
a trailer that can store a deluxe car inside but otherwise is fairly useless--
I wish they had engineered another mode with it, or something. As such,
unless you REALLY want a Mechtech DotM Optimus &amp; trailer but don't
want to spend the money for the
     <a href="dotmultprime.html">
      Ultimate version
     </a>
     ,
I can't recommend this, even for Optimus Prime fans, because of how little
it offers compared to the much cheaper "vanilla" Wal-Mart exclusive release
of this mold or the
     <a href="dotmcyprimebase.html">
      Cyberverse set
