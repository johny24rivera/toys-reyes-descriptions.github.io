       A blue jeep may not be
all that realistic, but it that doesn't stop Payload's color scheme from
looking fairly cool. The blue is really attractive shade, and the gray
makes a nice accent color, as does the light green, and the latter two
help Payload to share a "color scheme theme" with his teammates,
       <a href="kobushilandslide.html">
        Kobushi
       </a>
       and
       <a href="scattorbrainmonocle.html">
        Scattorbrain
       </a>
       . The red-colored
twine used for the hauling rope on the front is also a really nice color
that catches the light well, too. Payload also shares the same general
number of paint apps that the previous versions of this mold did, so no
complaints there-- and the silver and yellow really blend in nicely with
the blue, as well.
      </font>
      <br/>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       No mold changes have
been made to Payload-- however, like his teammates, he has a Decepticon
symbol painted over his molded-in Minicon symbol, which is rather stupid.

         You'd expect anyone as big and tough
as Payload to be pretty dumb, or at least used to relying on his natural
strength and endurance to get him through life. Many have made the same
mistake, but you underestimate the intelligence of this Mini-Con at your
peril. Payload would much rather outwit his opposition than destroy them
in a straight fight. He therefore spends his time setting traps and pitfalls
for Ascentor, who - while smart - is often distracted by his own thoughts.

           Ascentor's color scheme
definitely far worse than Payload's. He's almost entirely that horrid shade
of yellow, and he has fewer paint apps than either of the mold's previous
paint jobs to break up all of that icky color. The charcoal black isn't
too bad of a color, and neither is the orange and gunmetal gray, but that
awful yellow just pretty much negates any other cool colors he has. Although
the fact that only his feet are dull orange, and no other part of his body
is that color, is a bit of an odd color choice, methinks.

           No mold changes have

the rear end of his turret, however.

             Unlike Monocle, and Landslide, Ascentor
maintained contact with the Mini-Con robots that returned to Cybertron
after the Armada Battles. Over the years, he has developed a philosophical
give-and-take with the Mini-Con Council of Sages. This ongoing discussion
occupies much of his core processor time, causing him to be distracted,
and vulnerable to the traps set by payload. However, his years of deep
thought have also caused his sensory and motor-control systems to rewrite
themselves, giving him what appears to be nearly be a sixth sense when
it comes to avoiding pitfalls and sneak attacks.

             Payload vs. Ascentor
is the worst of the Wave 2 Minicon Vs. Packs. Both are pretty mediocre,
uninspired Minicon molds to start out with, and though Payload has a nice
color scheme, Ascentor's is rather gag-worthy. Not recommended unless you're
a Minicon or Cybertron completist.
