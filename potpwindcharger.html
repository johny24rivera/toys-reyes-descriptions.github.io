    Windcharger's vehicle
mode is a fairly nondescript spotscar that looks like it belongs in the
'80s or early '90s-- in other words, it's pretty accurate to the source
material of the original toy, not updating the alt mode nearly as much
as his other fairly recent toys. His proportions are fairly spot-on, with
no real robot mode extras unless you want to count just the
    <i>
     tiniest
    </i>
    bit of his chest he's got sticking out below the bottom middle of the car.
This is very minor, though. He's got some "shade" lines down the rear window
and some other fairly basic details, most of them just a few lines here
and there-- a bit un-detailed as far as Generations figures go, but he
IS supposed to be a fairly sleek car, so there's that. There's some simple
vents on the front, taillights molded into the rear section, and little
spokes molded into the wheels, though, so there is that. The color scheme
is pretty basic-- basically just a dark red and black in this mode, for
the most part, with the black reserved for the wheels and windows. However,
though not immediately apparent in this mode, some of the black-- namely,
that used for the windows that aren't the back windows-- is actually a
pretty dark tinted clear plastic, so you can see through it ever-so-slightly.
This helps a bit, as you can pull back on Windcharger's hood and back section
in this mode and there's a space in the middle there to seat a Prime Master
or Titan Master, to help him fit in with the line. There's some silver
paint on his front grill, as well as on the back. However, on the back
end it's painted rather oddly-- in two fat stripes, as these become his
upper legs. The actual molded details back there aren't painted.

    Windcharger's transformation
to robot mode is fairly simple-- rotate the back halves and roof back and
fold those roof bits up a tad to become the robot legs; fold the front
hood onto the back; then flip out the arms from the sides and rotate down
the top portion of the body just a titch so it's not as long. Tada! Robot
mode. If the alt mode was pretty faithful to G1, this one is fairly slavishly
so. The proportions are fairly blocky, with clonkin' feet made from the
center section of the car mode; a fairly rectangular chest, though with
a rounder waist; and fairly square arms, too. The arms have a bit of the
car doors hanging off the sides of them, and the hood sticks out a little
from behind the main body, but these are both fairly minor; there isn't
really any obnoxious kibble in this mode. That said, the proportions are
just a little off-- the legs are a bit short and the body a bit long/large.
Again, it's not a huge, toy-ruining issue by any means, but it is noticeable.
There's quite a few angular, squarish details on the chest, which help
make up for the lack of mold detailing in vehicle mode. There's also a
few minor stylistic details on the arms, as well. The head is... well,
where I think things definitely get TOO slavishly G1. It just looks odd;
the head's too old-school, with a slightly narrowed square for a head behind
a fairly wide face with diamond-shaped eyes and a fairly nondescript, neutral
expression on his face with a slight "chinstrap" detail on the bottom.
It just looks right like it belongs on a G1 toy and not a toy from 2018--
update or not, the proportions needed to be changed here with a better
expression on the face. For the color scheme, a fairly dull brownish gray
makes its appearance in this mode, entirely on the main body, waist, and
head, and helps add at least a bit more variation to the red-and-black.
His appendages are mostly still those colors, but his upper legs are, as
mentioned earlier, painted a nice silver shade. There's also silver on
his face, some light metallic silvery blue on his eyes, and a bit of black
on his waist and chest. It's not an amazing color scheme, but it does the
trick. For articulation in this mode, Windcharger can move at the neck,
shoulders (at two points), elbows, hips, and knees. Unfortunately no waist
rotation, but many of these points are ball joints, so he's fairly articulate,
especially above the waist.

    Windcharger isn't a
bad Legends class toy by any means-- he has almost no kibble in either
mode, and his car proportions are great-- but I think they went a bit too
slavishly G1 with this update. The headsculpt is definitely off, his car
mode needed to be modernized a bit more in my opinion, and his proportions
are slightly skewed in robot mode as well. Other than that he's a solid,
though fairly straightforward, toy. I think the
