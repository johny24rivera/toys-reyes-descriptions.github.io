    This time around, the
Clone Pilot has the alternate mode of a V-19 Torrent Starfighter. With
its wings fully extended, this thing looks freaking HUGE, though obviously
a lot of that has to do with the large, flat wings. Its actual "flight
mode" has the wings down below the body of the starfighter, so you can't
really stand it up like that, though the wings can also fold up and into
themselves, and two landing gear can extend for a "landing mode" so you
can actually place it on something. This Clone Pilot's mold detailing is
fair, thoguh in all honestly it's a bit sparse in comparison to other SWTFs
in vehicle mode. Still, this is probably to still make the mode look sleek
and all that. There's one really obvious mech mode extra that really irks
me, and that's the legs which stuck out of the bottom of the main part
of the body. I mean, they don't even TRY to mesh. Other than that, though,
this mode is pretty extra-free, and the proportions look pretty spot-on,
so no problems there. The V-Wing also has two trigger-activated missile
launchers on the ends of each of its main wings, though they can pop off
rather easily. In fact, the whole toy feels rather loose, and though most
things don't actually just fall off by looking at them, the whole thing
feels more fragile than it should-- particularly the wings. This is not
one toy that's meant to be thrown around casually.

    The Clone Pilot's Mech
mode is definitely one of the least impressive of the Star Wars Transformers
robot modes. The core mech proportions are pretty solid-- no overly stick-like
arms here, though a minor quibble in this aspect is that the legs come
off of the sides of the pelvis in a rather odd manner. As far as articulation,
he can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows (at two points), wrists, waist
(though it's limited), hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and
ankles. That all sounds pretty good except for the shoulders (which can
only move back-and-forth), but all that stuff hanging off of the back,
in combination with the small feet, make it rather unlikely you're going
to get any particularly dynamic poses out of the Clone Pilot, here. And
that's what most of the points taken off of Clone Pilot's score are for--
just the ridiculous amount of backpack kibble he's got. I mean, at least
two of the wings fold up, but they're still really large proportionally
and having that huge tailfin and engines hanging off of his back without
anywhere to really lock into place sure isn't doing him any favors. Also,
as mentioned earlier, many of his joints are rather loose, particularly
when it comes to his wings, and things can snap off easily (though at least
they can peg back on easily). The Mech mode detailing is pretty good, adding
some white to the color scheme, though it's still a rather bland color
scheme, with the dark red and the bit of black providing the only real
contrast against all those light colors. The head sculpt is quite well-done,
though, with tons of mold and paint details. As far as weaponry, Clone
Pilot has his two missile launchers from vehicle mode that can be held
in his hands as guns-- however, they have those darn knobs instead of pegs
for the Clone Pilot to hold onto, so they fall out of his hands far too
easily. As with other Star Wars TFs released in the Clone Wars packaging,
Clone Pilot has a openable cockpit complete with all the appropriate details
inside, but he doesn't come with a miniature pilot figure.

    The V-19 Torrent Starfighter
Clone Pilot is one of the worse SWTFs figures. His vehicle mode is pretty
cool-- though also rather loose-- but his mech mode is just so laden down
with vehicle kibble any upsides it has are just completely overwhelmed
by all that kibble and limited articulation. Not recommended except for
line completists.

      The clone pilot flies his V-19 Torrent
starfighter toward the Separatist army, pouring down blaster fire from
the sky above. The Separatists launch their own fighters into the air,
sure of an easy victory against the lone attacker Â– until the clone pilot
morphs his fighter into a powerful mech that quickly scatters the Separatist
forces in all directions!
