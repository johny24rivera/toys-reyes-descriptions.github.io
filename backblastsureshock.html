       Backblast (teehee!) has
rather unusual colors for a rocket-- purple, gray, and brown. I don't know
about you, but I've never seen a rocket with brown and purple as main colors.
Still, the unrealisticness of it aside (is that a word?), the colors fit
together pretty well, especially the brown and purple. It's nice to see
color combinations like that, that are both original and work well together.
The gray serves as a nice third color, with not enough of it to make the
toy dull. Backblast does definitely need a few more paint apps, however,
as his face, nosecone, and jet engines are the only parts painted on him
(though the former is painted especially well, considering its minute size).
Having the rocket windows painted or parts of the large shoulder piece
in robot mode would have helped to vary the colors a bit more and make
him look less prototypish.

       No mold changes have
been made to Backblast, so he unfortunately retains the same fragility
in his cannon-arm that Skyblast did. He does have a new Decepticon emblem
plastered on his robot chest, however.

         Backblast is a simple robot, nearly
incapable of independant thought. When Backblast is told to attack, he
attacks, and does not stop attacking until the order is given. It is only
when he is joinged with the other two members of the Deep Space Mini-Con
Team as the powerful Umbral Blaster that he feels his full potential. As
a robot, he is only a barely sentient battering ram, but as a part of the
Umbral Blaster the energy stored within his armored body is released in
an unstoppable storm of destruction.

           Sureshock's back with
a new paint job, and for the MOST part, I think it's better than the previous
one this mold has gotten. He keeps the basic blue and white that his Energon
form had, though they're not completely in the same places. However, a
few new colors have been added, including a rather sharp-looking red for
the seat/robot head and upper arms (though using it for the head may not
have been the best of decisions). Snazzy purple flams have been added to
the vehicle mode as well, and they look pretty hot against the blue, even
if they aren't the most visible deco jobs since they don't contrast all
that much. However, what knocks down this version of Sureshock to a rating
slightly below that of Energon Sureshock is that horrible, pukey shade
of bluish green used for his lower arms. UGH, it looks terrible, and completel
clashes with the red and white, and even if the entire toy was blue and
purple, it should only have been used as a minor accent color. If completely
throws off the color vibe of the rest of the toy.

           No mold changes have
been made to Sureshock, though a new Autobot symbol has been painted over
his molded-in Minicon symbol, which is kinda lame.

             For Sureshock, it's nice to finally
be back in action. He's enjoyed the relative peace uncer the Council of
Sages, but even the most exciting off-road courses on the moons of Cybertron
don't compare to hopping from asteroid to asteroid under the constant threat
of enemy attack. Sureshock lives for excitment, after all, and there's
nothing more exciting than penetrating deep into enemy territory in order
to pick a fight!

             Backblast vs. Sureshock
is a Minicon set with fairly attractive paint jobs (except for the ugly
bluish green lower arms on Sureshock). However, both of the molds are pretty
bad, so unless you're a Minicon completist or really REALLY want to form
the Umbral Blaster and Perceptor, you're better off passing on this set,
even if you don't have any of the previous versions of these molds.
