    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to G1 Starscream. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of G1 Starscream

     , Dirge is not just a repaint of
Starscream, but also a partial remold. He now has four horizontal wings
in vehicle mode, the front much smaller than the back. The back wings also
have a small vertical notch on the ends, instead of larger vertical wings
next to the engines like on Dirge's three predecessors. And although I
prefer the style of Dirge's wings over the previous three, his plane mode
looks oddly incomplete without those big vertical wings in the back. Especially
since the peg for them is still there. Dirge's guns also don't fire any
missiles, but are just pieces of plastic this time around. When they're
mounted on his arms in robot mode, they also tend to bend a little because
they peg in so close to the arms that the raised fists in the front put
a bit of pressure on them. This isn't too major of a problem now, although
after a few years it could cause the guns to permanently warp if you display
him in robot mode. As for Dirge's color scheme itself, it's very nice in
and of itself; blue, brown, and black, while not a very varied color scheme,
does the job and meshes well. One thing I don't like about it, though,
is that it's very similar to Thundercracker's scheme. I mean, if you're
going to go through all the effort of remolding a toy, you're probably
going to want to at least change the color scheme on the latter entirely.
But one point in Dirge's favor is that he's $5 cheaper than any of the
previous three seekers. Granted, $30 is still too much to reasonably ask
for a plastic brick like this, but it's better than $35. One more interesting
point to note; on the old TV show, Dirge's plane nose cone stuck out from
the top of his head, while on the actual toy, the instructions, and the
box art, it's bent backwards from the head like all the other seekers.
Although I think the conehead looks dorkier, it does make him noticeably
more show-accurate. But I can't really recommend one configuration over
the other- it depends on whether you like show accuracy or looks more.

     Dirge is a nice remold
and repaint of Starscream, but his lack of rear vertical wings in vehicle
mode makes him look somehow naked (not that he's wearing any clothes in
the first place), and his guns may warp over time. Not to mention the robot
mode is crud, just like on the other seekers. Unless you're a big time
seeker fan or a completist, though, I can't recommend him, even at the
slightly-reduced price. Especially with so many other Transformers coming
out nowadays.

       The sound of his engines causes petrifying
fear in those who hear them. He's a master at handling fear. Other Decepticons
put off by his mournful, silent ways. "He gives me the creeps," says Ramjet.
He carries two concussion missiles. Needs to control a situation otherwise
he, too, falls victim to fear - making him useless as a warrior!
