    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Legends
class Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Movie Legends class Starscream toy

     Out of all the Legends
released from the first movie, the one I hoped would get a new mold the
most out of all of them was Starscream. Sadly, that wasn't the case, as
he still has that really ugly (in a bad way), extra-laden, just plain bad
mold from the first movie released again for the second one. The plastic
used for this one is even uglier, though-- the shade of tan is actually
a really blah tan-gray that isn't really either, and with all the swirls
'n such in the plastic it looks cheap (even though I doubt it's any cheaper
than any "normal" plastic). It doesn't look even vaguely metallic, it's
like what coffee looks like with too much cream in it. The black tattoo
paint apps in jet mode look really nice, though, and help make up for the
bad-looking plastic. The black chest and the couple of tattoos in robot
mode also look nice as well, as does the shade of metallic light blue used
for the cockpit. However, there's no paint apps whatsoever on the tailfins,
arms, or legs, making those pieces look waaay too plain.

     No mold changes have
been made to RotF Legends Starscream... sadly.

     Even though I love RotF
Legends Starscream's new tattoo paint apps, the mold is just pretty darn
bad for a modern Transformer, he's missing some badly-needed paint apps
on his appendages and tailfins, and the completely boring, un-metallic
main plastic color make it worse than the original Movie Legends Screamer,
in my opinion. Not recommended at all. Even completists may want to think
twice about this one.
