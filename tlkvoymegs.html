    Megatron's alternate
mode is some kind of futuristic alien jet, but it's a lot more in the realm
of what I would call "realistic fiction" than his mess of a vehicle mode
from the
    <a href="movvoymegatron.html">
     2007 movie
    </a>
    . It's considerably
more streamlined, with a very long, skinny nosecone, what I presume is
some type of engine/exhaust setup in the middle of the toy, and skinny
wings that could stand to be a bit longer, but are within the realm of
normalcy for jet TFs. On the back end are some relatively small exhaust
ports on the sides, though Megatron's upper shoulders and pecs are also
a bit apparent on the back end if you know what to look for. More obvious
than this-- and the weakest part of this mode-- are the bits of his lower
legs below each wing, the feet in particular sticking out a bit from the
back side of each wing. From a side view, Megatron is also just a BIT thicker
from a vertical standpoint than you'd expect a jet to be, but just so--
it's not bad at all, especially in comparison to most other jet TFs. The
mold detailing in this mode isn't insanely detailed, but there's parts
where it's impressie, such as all the angular lines on his nosecone, as
well as all the little details on his "engine" in the middle. There's also
the usual aerodynamic lines on the wings as you'd expect, and what I'm
guessing are intakes near the sides of the engines. His color scheme is
almost entirely a dark milky bluish gray plastic-- movie Megatron isn't
one known for being colorful, after all. There is a bit of a more "normal"
dark gray plastic, used mostly in his robot mode but still visible on a
few parts here, such as the pieces on the sides of his engine and his curved
sword, which is stored on top of the rear section of this mode. There's
a bit of light muddy brown paint used as well-- on the front of each wing,
as well as on his engine and a bit on his cockpit and nosecone. His cockpit
window itself is a menacing transparent red, with what I would argue are
"eyes" near the front. Finally, there's a bit of light metallic silvery
blue paint used on the intakes. I wish there was a bit more paint near
the rear of the toy especially, and that there was a bit more of Megatron
that wasn't in the dark blue-gray spectrum, but overall his color scheme
fits his demeanor and ain't bad. Unfortunately, there isn't any landing
gear in this mode.

    Megatron's transformation
isn't too tough-- mostly it's his wings becoming the legs and the body
of the jet folding up and around to become his robot body and arms, while
the nosecone folds down onto his back and reveals his head. The hip pieces
do some funny spinnin' around to complete the illusion in both modes, though.
The end result is fantastic-- movie Megatron's never had a pretty face,
but
wow he looks evil and tough here. I love the slightly asymmetrical look,
with a large spike on his otherwise rounded left shoulder, while his right
shoulder has multiple smaller spikes. His mold detailing and look in general
certainly fits a movie titled "The Last Knight", with plated armor seeming
to cover almost every inch of him, from his separate pec pieces to the
rather intricate angular lower arms and gauntlets to the pointy kneecaps
and toes to the hip "skirt" pieces. Every piece isn't just well-detailed,
it also has an ornamental look to it-- regal, yet wicked. Plus, just look
at that visage-- Megatron looks positively demonic now, with even his side
antennae being rather pointed, with a rounded domehead with red points
in it, with a very toothy grin and evil-lookin' eyes. The color makeup
to this mode takes the same general colors of the alt mode, but the dark
gray and dark milky bluish gray are mixed together in a more aesthetically
pleasing manner, with some silver paint here and there to help shine him
up a bit. He's also got some more light muddy brown detailing on his lower
arms, right shoulder, waist, cannon, and on his teeth (eeew). He does have
a little kibble in this mode-- a little bit of his main jet body peeks
out from behind the skinniest part of his waist, and his nosecone does
sit a bit behind his upper back. You can also see his wings folded around
his lower legs. All are pretty minor overall, though, given the rest of
the mode. For weaponry he has a fusion cannon on his right arm (natch),
though it's smaller and slimmer than other Megatron cannons tend to be--
it fits his look, though. He also has a very long sword with a wide, curved
blade at the end-- very unique, I like. For articulation in this mode,
Megatron can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows inwards
at the wrists, and at the hips (at three points), knees, and tilts at the
ankles. Pretty much all you could ask for except rotation at the waist,
though given his transformation that's impossible.

    The voyager class version
of TLK Megatron is his best version, in my opinion. Yes, it's not as large
as the Leader version, and he also unfortunately can't form his "battlemask"
on this version, but otherwise this toy just rocks, in both modes. There's
some minor kibble below his wings in vehicle mode, but it's still pretty
slim and unique-looking, and his robot mode is just incredible all-around.
Highly recommended.
