    Vehicle mode is a helicopter.
Ro-Tor (DUMB name), although with a color scheme that is more varied than,
say,
    <a href="movor.html">
     Movor's
    </a>
    , is rather barren in this mode without
his extra weapons on (see above). I guess it's the fact that the back part
of the helicopter is almost entirely dark blue, and the red weapons add
a bit more zing to the color scheme. My only complaint about the weapons
is that the back ones obscure the Decepticon symbol on Ro-Tor's left side
(why it's only on one side, I don't know). His front gun is also mounted
slightly off-center, but this isn't that noticeable. The silver windows
and orange arrows really do add a lot more than they appear do, and vary
the color scheme quite a bit on the front side. Both blades in this mode
can spin of course- although for some reason, the larger one is detachable
(and no, he can't hold it in his robot mode).

    Ro-Tor's robot mode,
although with a nicely varied color scheme, leaves a bit to be desired.
First off, he has no actual hands; they're just molded outlines on the
inside of his arms (and rather large ones proportionally at that). His
guns mounted on the back of his arms are also a bit big proportionally
in this mode, and detract from the mode a bit. It's actually better to
just leave them off in this mode. Same goes for the smaller gun; it fits
on the inside of his arm, but considering that it's not nearly as big as
the end of his (rather ride) arm, it looks rather puny. Ro-Tor's articulation
is also pretty limited in this mode; he can only move his arms at the shoulders
(at two points), and his knees (individually, but the legs aren't seperate,
and the knees don't stay in any position very well unless they're locked
straight down). As expected, this rather hampers his playability. The helicopter
tail fin halves on the bottom of his arms are also rather obvious extras,
too. However, Ro-Tor's chest is rather nicely done, as is the blades on
his back- that's the perfect place to put them, so that one can spin the
blades to have him "fly" in robot mode.

    Although Ro-Tor has
a comparatively varied color scheme, and a nice helicopter mode, his robot
mode is rather poor by today's standards, showing the mold's age a bit.
You need him to form Ruination, though.
