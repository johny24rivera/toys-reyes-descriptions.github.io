     Megatron's vehicle mode
has a ton of great mold detailing, and is very accurate to his larger version.
It even has the little Cyber Key slot molded on the top, which is a cool
extra detail considering none of the Legends of Cybertron toys have Cyber
Key gimmicks. The paint detailing is decent on the front half, but there
really could stand to be a few teal or silvery blue paint apps on the back
half, as otherwise it's just almost all gray. The metallic purple is a
really good paint choice, though, and looks better than the normal purple
used on the larger version. The only real proportional differences between
this mode and its larger counterpart are that the gaps between the parts
near the front half pieces of the mode are slightly more noticeable since
they're proportionally larger. But that's a rather minor complaint, as
the whole vehicle mode still looks rather solid unless you're looking at
it from a top-down view. What's interesting is that there's actually an
improvement between the way this mode is constructed over the larger versions--
instead of having the robot upper leg flaps bend diagonally behind the
rear of the mode, not only looking odd but proning the plastic to warping
over time, the feet and the leg flaps simply turn upwards as one piece
from the rear wheels, this keeping this mode looking accurate to the larger
version, but without the odd flaps in the back-- a nice design touch. Unlike
his larger version, he can't transform into his jet mode, but that was
a pretty iffy mode anyways.

     In robot mode, Megatron
still looks rather accurate when compared to his larger version-- of course,
he has fewer paint apps, and a few less colors-- namely, less of that ugly
green prominent on the larger version, which is actually a plus. He has
odd little bumps on the heels of his legs, which make it impossible for
his feet to remain flat, but they also make it easier to stand up. His
upper legs are even smaller proportionally when compared to his lower legs
than they were on the larger version, but he still can move his legs rather
well, as he has ball joints at both the hips and knees (though the joints
do tend to pop off rather easily at the hips). His only other articulation
in this mode involves his head being able to look up and down slightly
and his arms being able to move below the shoulders on ball joints. It's
not a whole lot, but hey, he's only 3 bucks, you can't expect to have him
be super-posable and still have an accurate transformation.

     Legends of Cybertron
Megatron is one of the better, more faithful miniaturizations of the "regular"
toy, with a very accurate and surprisingly complicated transformation for
such a small figure, as well as well-proportioned robot and vehicle modes.
He needs a few more paint apps, and like all Legends of Cybertron toys,
he has a few articulation problems, but that's really about it. Mildly
recommended if you like small little Transformers, or just don't want to
plop down $40 on the larger version.
