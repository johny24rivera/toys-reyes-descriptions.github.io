    Jolt's vehicle mode is
a slightly "kiddie-fied" version of the Chevrolet Volt. The proportions
for the MOST part are fairly realistic, except for the width-- Jolt is
definitely considerably wider in vehicle mode than an actual Volt. The
core colors of dark blue and black work fairly well in this mode, even
if they aren't particularly spectacular, and all the necessary mold detailing
is here-- rear-view mirrows, headlights, taillights, that sort of thing.
He's also a got a pretty good amount of paint detailing in this mode too,
with all of the relevant bumper &amp; headlight/tailight details painted
up, along with his front window. That window is painted a dark gunmetal
gray though, which honestly isn't all that different from the black used
for his roof (and his other unpainted windows-- if you're gonna paint one
window, paint all of 'em, please). Besides the windows, the only paint
app really missing is his license plate. There's no robot extras whatsoever
in this mode, which is certainly a plus, though a few of the panel lines--
particularly the one in the middle of his windshield-- can detract from
the overall look a bit.

    Jolt's transformation
is almost laughably simple, but then again that's the point of Fast Action
Battlers. All things considered, he looks pretty decent in robot mode,
with lots of great detailing on his chest, head, and upper legs (even though
in the case of the chest, there isn't an adequate number of paint apps
to back those mold details up). Here Jolt's "true" color scheme is revealed,
with light and dark milky gray mixing with the dark blue and black from
vehicle mode as well as a bit of dull greenish blue. All in all, it definitely
gives him a slightly electric vibe, though a bit brighter of an "electric"
blue shade used in place of his dull greenish blue might have worked better.
The proportions are generally good, except for his really skinny, overly
stiff two-dimensional arms made out of what are primarily his doors in
vehicle mode. The entire front third of the car also just hangs off his
upper back, which is a bit of an eyesore. The ends of the car make decent
feet, though. As far as Jolt's gimmicks go, he has two of them-- first,
if you press in on the green-blue tab on the top of each arm, electric
"whips" will extend out from each of his claw-hands. They're surprisingly
long, though they're just one place of plastic-- they're not made of thread
or anything where you can actually "whip" them around, unfortunately. Related
to this gimmick, he also has a "whip-lashing" action feature in each arm--
pull up on the arm a bit, then let it go and the spring-loaded joint in
the shoulders will let the whips fling downwards a bit. It's okay, but
it really interferes with shoulder movement, really restricting the poses
he can pull off. Other than that point, he also has two other points of
articulation in the shoulders, as well as (slight) side-to-side movement
at the neck and articulation at the waist, knees, and ankles, which isn't
all that bad for a Fast Action Battler.

    Electro Whip Jolt has
a pretty decent (if overly wide) kibble-free vehicle mode, and an okay
robot mode. There are several niggling details, such as a big section of
his vehicle mode hanging behind his head and the annoying arm-flinging
gimmick, but given the target audience, many of these are forgiveable.
He's about a middle-of-the-line Fast Action Battler, all things considered.
Great for little kids, but for older kids and collectors, the mainline
deluxe Jolt is the mold you want to pick up instead.

      Jolt makes a habit of getting into trouble.
He is chaotic and impulsive, always out for the next big adventure. If
there is danger afoot, he is sure to find his way into the middle of it.
Luckily, he's got the fighting skills to get himself out of any binds he
gets himself into. When he's got his electro whips in his hands, he's an
almost unstoppable whirlwind of crackling energy.
