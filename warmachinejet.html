     A repaint of any Iron
Man mold into War Machine is pretty much inevitable, and now it's the Flying
Wing mold's turn. As you'd expect from War Machine, black makes up the
dominant color, though the gray/silver is surprisingly missing in vehicle
mode. In mech mode it's made up for the with the gray plastic-- which looks
a bit like a glossy metal finish, so it's certainly the most boring shade
of gray I've seen on a toy-- and a bit of nice silver paint on the head.
The inside of the "hidden" wing flap that partially hides the missile launchers
from view is also painted entirely silver to add a bit more of that gray
in. What's most striking about this War Machine deco, however, is the red.
It's of just the right shade to really make it POP against the black, and
works together excellently with both that and the silver. Although the
red paint apps are used on all the really important spots-- like the mech
mode eyes, chest, cockpit windows, and the like-- I was really hoping for
a more prominent use of it in vehicle mode. Honestly, it doesn't have to
be the red or the silver, either will do-- but the vehicle mode is almost
COMPLETELY black, with no other colors featuring prominently (unless you
open up the wings, but to be honest that always looks a bit odd to me).
A War Machine-y logo on the wings, some stripes or circuitry patterns--
just SOMETHING. War Machine's vehicle mode, although certainly not bad,
is way more dull and un-detailed than it should be.

     The flying wing War
Machine redeco has some great colors-- particularly the light red-- but
it needs a bit something more in vehicle mode to really make it stand out
among the Marvel TFs. Even considering that however, this is my favorite
deco job this mold has gotten.

       Even with all the weapons War Machine
carries, there's always a good reason to carry more. The same military
technicians that modified the original War Machine armor created this converting
version. They increased its size and speed to match the military's best
fighter jets, and added even more of the most devastating weaponry available
to modern science.
