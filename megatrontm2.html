    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 dragon. This mode is very impressive, and my favorite of the three modes
of this ultra Transformer. Standing at its full height, this toy is taller
than
    <a href="opop.html">
     Optimal Optimus
    </a>
    ! However, almost half of this
height is the dragon neck and head. The amount of colors on this toy is
incredible, more than I have seen on any other Beast Wars Transformer.
This mode is very articulate, and has a lot of levers! There is a lever
that allows you to move Megatron's dragon head, and a lever that allows
you to flap his wings, too! One of the neat features of this lever is that
you can lock it in place to keep Megatron's wings open. There is also a
flexible tail, but, unfortunately, this does not have a lever. His spark
orb is in the middle of his dragon chest, so you can't miss it. You can
fire a missle from his dragon mouth and above his robot head visor. However,
this toy comes with three missles, and while it is nice that there is an
extra one in case you lose one, there is no place to store it. The only
major problem I have with this mode is that Megatron's robot head is clearly
visible in this mode at the base of his tail. The tail also looks oddly
placed, and you can't position it so it looks like it "flows" off of Megatron,
instead of being a seperate piece of him.

    Vehicle mode is the
best so far that I've seen of the Transmetal 2s, but that isn't saying
much. His feet swing forward and reveal small wheels, and two plates around
his upper legs swing upward to become wheels. You then lower Megs to the
ground, and that's his "vehicle" mode. It's very hard to get the wheels
to actually roll, considering numerous plastic parts get in the way, such
as part of the legs and the dragon head. The panels that swing out to reveal
the larger wheels tend to come off easily, and, although you can just snap
them back on, it's annoying.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Robot mode looks fairly
nice, overall. Transformation to robot mode, however, is very difficult.
Give yourself a good 10 minutes the first couple of times to transform
ol' Megs, but you'll probably be able to eventually bring the transformation
down to 2 minutes. There are very few "backpack" pieces on this transformer,
just the dragon arms and the dragon tail end. Megs has a nice visor in
this mode, and his wings look very impressive. He looks a bit bulkier than
his other two modes, but this is probably to emphasize his strength. The
only major problem I have with this mode his is dragon-head "arm". It doesn't
look right in this mode, and it is extremely bulky and long when compared
with the other arm. It also hangs limp, and there is no locking lever for
the head that works well.

    A very nice transfomer;
recommended. Vehicle mode and dragon-head "arm" are poor, though.

      Megatron - supreme tyrant, evil genius,
and commander of the Predacons - combines brute strength, military cunning,
ruthlessness and terror to achieve cruel methods of oppression. Fused with
original MegatronÂ’s spark essence and thrown into a volcano, he rises into
his most powerful and befitting incarnation yet: the dragon. Breathes pyro-beam
torpedoes that give birth to flames buring 1,000 times hotter than oil.
Deploys wings in beast, ground-speeder and robot modes. Can fly up to 400
mph. Tail fires electrostatic energy and captures enemies for later torture.
Travels up to 250 mph as ground-speeder while retaining full combat capabilities.
Now experiences difficulty controlling rage, leaves excessive wake of fire
and devastation. Recognizes this weakness but believes new Transmetal 2
form will empower him to defeat Optimal Optimus.

      NOTE: On the models released of Megatron Transmetal 2, there is something
wrong with the neck lever. To fix this, get a screwdriver. Loosen the screw
in the neck lever, turn the lever 180 degrees, then tighten it again. This
should fix the problem.
      <p>
       (Thanks to Benson Yee for the above tip in fixing Megs.)
