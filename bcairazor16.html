    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Generations
Windblade toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Generations Windblade toy

     Airazor gets
     <a href="chromia10.html">
      another
"pre-BW" toy
     </a>
     -- another jet, but a remold of Generations Windblade this
time. The color scheme is incredibly spot-on, with the main colors being
a charcoal black that under certain lights look like a very dark brown
as well as a Bumblebee "cheesy" orange-yellow. There's plenty of other
colors, though, like a really nice pale light brown on halves of the wings,
the outside of her upper legs, the "feathers" on her arm blasters, and
most of her vehicle mode nosecone (the tip is left black to "ape" her future
bird mode look). The things that really make this toy an absolutely AMAZING
homage to Airazor, though, are all the intricate robot mode paint apps.
Her upper legs have the pale brown on the outside, dull pumpkin orange
lines in the middle, and yellow on the inside; yellow and pumpkin orange
on the toes to imitate her "talons"; a mix of pumpkin orange, yellow, and
silver on her waist in a very good attempt to mimic her eagle head-chest,
but with a jet cockpit there in place of the eagle head; gray wavy lines
on her upper chest and shoulders to emulate eagle feathers; and, best of
all, yellow, dull orange, and silver on her face that mimics her BW show
model face admirably well given that it's not a new head mold. Her light
green eyes really pop against all those colors, as well, and this is carried
over to the transparent light green plastic for the jet cockpit in vehicle
mode.

     No mold changes have
been made that are unique to Airazor, but she has the same changes made
to the Windblade mold as TakaraTOMY Legends Slipstream; that is, a new
head, a new robot chest with a faux jet cockpit worked into it, and arm
blasters as opposed to Windblade's sword-and-sheath.

     Airazor is definitely
the BotCon 2016 exclusive with the best paint apps-- there's a ton of them
even for an exclusive, particularly in robot mode, and a LOT of work was
done to make a toy that was originally intended to be a completely different
character look almost EXACTLY like Airazor-- the face, chest, and upper
leg paint apps are particularly well-done, and it's generally just a good
color scheme in general. Plus, the fact that it uses molding previously
only available from TakaraTOMY is another bonus. Unfortunately, the mold
itself isn't that great, though the changes made to Slipstream make it
minorly better. I don't think it's quite as good as FunPub's first attempt
at a pre-BW Airazor (though it has better paint apps), but if you can't
get that version this is a pretty decent back-up.

       As with nearly all fliers, Airazor prefers
to spend her time in the sky, soaring far above the land and water. Despite
her great speeds, things feel slower in the air; there's room to think
and move freely without the crush and hustle of those below. It is also
from such great heights that the reconnaissance expert is able to do her
best work as she sends intelligence on the enemy back to waiting ground
troops.

       That's not to say she's one to stay
out of the fray. Outfitted with concealed blades and her arm-mounted photon
cannons, Airazor proves just as beneficial on the ground as she is amongst
the stars. Outside of battle, her ability to clearly read and play off
of the strengths and attitudes of others makes her a valuable asset in
large groups and in one-on-one situations for bots who prefer to work in
solitude.
