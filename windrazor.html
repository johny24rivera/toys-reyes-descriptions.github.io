    Beast mode is a wolf/eagle
fuzor. This is the first fuzor repaint that is a BotCon Exclusive. This
beast mode looks very nice and fierce. The robot arms inside his hind legs
are a little noticeable, but this does not subtract much from the overall
appearance of the toy. Although the black ends and the red eyes are a nice
touch, this transformer has a bit too much uncolored white on him for my
tastes- makes him look more like a prototype than the finished product.

    Robot mode looks nice,
but again, the color scheme suffers from too much white. One of the neatest
features in this mode is the transparent purple orb instead of a red one
on his stomach. It has the appearance of a spark. The transformation to
robot mode is not so much hard as it is just annoying to get his wolf head
to stay in between the two sides of his stomach. After a bit of playing
with, the sides tend to come disconnected almost all the time. Another
problem I have is that his wing missles can be fitted into his hands to
become swords, but they look way too stubby and wide to be weapons.

    A nice BotCon Exclusive.
Recommended, if you're willing to pay the cost for it.

    <i>
     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      After a tragic betrayal, a young Maximal
warrior's life-force was nearly extinguished. A hardened veteran of the
Great War voluntarily donated his withering Spark to save the mortally
wounded youth. The resulting fusion mutated and merged the two forms to
create a new breed of warrior. Now possessing a unique binary-Spark system,
Windrazor strives to bring an end to the conflict raging across Cybertron.
He possesses twin shoulder-mounted rocket launchers that quickly bring
down his enemies. Windrazor also possesses the wit and wisdom of a battle-worn
soldier and the youthful energy of a child. This deadly combination makes
him a fierce and dangerous fighter in the war that ravages Cybertron and
the rest of the universe.
