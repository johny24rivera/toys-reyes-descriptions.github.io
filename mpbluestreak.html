    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Masterpiece Prowl. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Masterpiece Prowl

     How much I like Bluestreak
compared to his repaint brethren generally depends on whether his gray
plastic is painted or not. Given that this is a Masterpiece toy, he is
COVERED in an extremely nice gunmetal gray paint that looks quite like
the finish on a brand new car. Plain gray plastic-- a rather medium, brownish
shade in this case-- is only used on pieces where it was absolutely necessary
because of paint scraping and whatnot. Namely, this means the shoulder
cannons, fists, and the inside of the lower legs. In vehicle mode Bluestreak
looks extremely slick, with oodles of that nice gunmetal gray and a fair
amount of black-- not just on expected places like the tires and front
and rear bumpers, but layered on in a nice glossy pattern on the front
and middle top of the car. It really helps to keep Bluestreak from being
"just" a silver car, and it looks extremely nice. All of the necessary
details are colored as well- the headlights and some of the taillights
are a nice shade of orange, with the remaining taillights being a dark
red. Bluestreak's clear plastic is of a tinted shade, which is nice as
it dulls the red in the car interior to help make the two modes more different
color-wise. In robot mode is where Bluestreak's red pops out, particularly
on the upper legs but also on the waist, on the back of the doors that
flank his shoulders, and a bit around the head. This helps add a bit more
contrast to Bluestreak's color scheme, which would otherwise be mostly
monochrome (albeit a very pretty monochrome). Also added to the robot mode
is a really dark shade of gunmetal gray paint, almost to the point where
it's black, on places like the upper shoulders and waist. There's also
some silver here and there where needed, like on the tire hubs, headlights,
and gun.

     There have been two
mold changes made to Bluestreak. The first is predictable-- the sirens
from MP Prowl have been removed, with a little flip-out piece on the roof
still allowing the gun to be stored up there in car mode. The second is
a surprise-- Bluestreak actually has a new headsculpt, despite him having
the same head design as Prowl. For this new headsculpt, Bluestreak has
a (slightly) less serious face and his red antennae aren't accentuated
as much. It's a nice headsculpt, and I really appreciate the added effort
to differentiate him from Prowl.

     Masterpiece Bluestreak
is a near-perfect mold for an updated version of his
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      G1
sculpt
     </a>
     , with an extremely well-done paint job; he's oozing gunmetal
gray paint from nearly every appropriate place, and the glossy black, red,
and various accent colors really help bring the whole package together.
The new headsculpt is unexpected but very much appreciated-- though the
$10 extra on the price tag compared to MP Prowl is not. Still, for those
who are able to buy toys in the Masterpiece price range, Bluestreak is
a must-get-- probably even if you already have Prowl.

       What's the most unstoppable thing on
the battlefield? The mouth of Bluestreak. He never stops talking and he's
not a fan of silence. He likes the Decepticons even less. If words were
fireblasts, Bluestreak would have wiped out the Decepticons long ago.
