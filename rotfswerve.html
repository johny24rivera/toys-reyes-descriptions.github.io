    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RotF deluxe class Sideswipe
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RotF deluxe
class Sideswipe toy

     Swerve is a bit of an
homage-- at least in terms of his general color scheme and personality--
to his G1 persona. In G1 though he was a TRUCK, so... not exactly an alt-mode
homage. Still, red looks good on a corvette, the Centennial Stingray corvette
is no exception. The dark blue contrasts with it quite well-- but unfortunately,
the red is flat plastic. It's not metallic paint like the silver on Sideswipe,
which makes the car mode look kinda dull in comparison what with no cool
paint deco job or anything. The one piece of plastic that IS painted red
in vehicle mode is noticeably lighter than the red plastic, as well. However,
in robot mode that's turned around a bit, as Swerve has a bit more color
variety, what with the black and silver paint apps and all. I kinda wish
there was a bit more of the bronze that we only see a glimpse of on Sweve's
chest, however-- that really would've made the color scheme pop a little
more and give it a bit more originality. And he still has that ugly light
milky gray used on a few of the smaller plastic pieces, blargh.

     Swerve has a new head,
which is a very unique design (and not at all like G1 Swerve's). It definitely
fits in as a movie Autobot, being a bit alien but not TOO much so, and
has some great mold and paint detailing on it. Unfortunately, the remolded
head is also stuck facing forward for some reason-- it can't turn like
Sideswipe's can.

     RotF Swerve is a decent
repaint, breaking up the robot mode a bit more in terms of colors, but
leaving the vehicle mode rather barren. Personally I would recommend Sideswipe
slightly more because of that suh-weet silver paint job in vehicle mode,
but if you desperately want a bit more color on your movie shelf next to
all the blacks and grays, Swerve here may be the way to go.

       Swerve is highly intelligent, though
you wouldn't know it to watch him drive. His duties as a metallurgist and
fabricator for the Autobots expose him to a lot of toxic chemicals, which
his circuits have been constantly exposed to for years. He has trouble
holding a straight line as a result. The other Autobots prefer to keep
him far away from battle, since he aims about as well as he drives.
