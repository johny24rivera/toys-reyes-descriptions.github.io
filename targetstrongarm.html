    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Strongarm. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Strongarm

     After all these redecoes,
Strongarm FINALLY gets a color scheme I think of first when I think of
jeeps-- green and brown. Of course, given that the whole theme of the Target
Scout repaints is "realistic deco jobs", finally giving Strongarm a realistic
green/brown scheme is fitting here. The colors fit together very, very
nicely, especially the two shades of green. You wouldn't think two shades
of the same color would complement each other so well, but they really
do. The light grey and black also serve as nice secondary colors, and are,
of course, realistic colors as well. This particular shade of brown looks
nice against the green, but it's a bit of purplish color, and just a plain
muddy brown would have looked better (and a tad more realistic), in my
opinion. The same goes for the color of Strongarm's transparent parts--
it's that same ugly transparent purplish brown that's on some of the other
Target Scout movie exclusives, and although it fits Strongarm SLIGHTLY
better than it does on the other occasions that it's used, it's still just
an ugly color for an energy weapon. One other, very minor, thing I'm not
fond of is that Strongarm has a Sector 7 paint app on the left side of
his chest (whee!), but his Autobot symbol isn't colored in at all (boo!).

     Although his transparent
weapon is a somewhat ugly color, overall I think this version of Strongarm
has the best color scheme out of all the versions of this mold released.
The greens, gray, black, and brown go REALLY nicely together. If you haven't
picked up this great mold yet, now's the time.

       Strongarm would rather work than fight,
just like his friend Signal Flare. He is an electronics and physics genius
who builds weapons and other gear for the Autobots. Good natured and friendly,
he always has a joke for any situation, and keeps up a constant stream
of conversation while he works, either with other robots in the room, or
with his voice-activated computer. He may not charge into battle all that
often, but as the good guy who keeps their gear in good order, heÂ’s seen
as invaluable by the other Autobots.
