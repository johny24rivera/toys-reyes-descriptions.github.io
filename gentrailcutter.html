    Trailcutter (aka Trailbreaker)--
at long last!-- gets a "regular"-sized, modern update with this Generations
release. His 4WD truck alt mode has the same general "feel" as his G1 toy,
but with a more modern, slightly more streamlined vehicle that doesn't
have so much "junk in the trunk", so to speak. There's no robot mode extras
whatsoever, which is always a good thing. However, despite his being somewhat
compact, Trailcuter is
    <i>
     small
    </i>
    in this mode, even by 2013 cost-cutting
deluxe standards, which is something to take into consideration given his
price. His color scheme of nearly solid black isn't going to win him any
awards in this mode, but it's certainly G1-accurate, and he has the same
yellow/red stripe patterns along his sides that he did on his G1 toy (though
they're a bit less prevalent on this release). This, along with the silver
missile rack (which can move up and down a little) and the guns mounted
on top of his roof, as well as his silver grill and pale gold headliights,
at least provides him a little color. However, he really could've used
some more paint apps on the back end-- no colored taillights or any sort
of rear paint apps are on the toy, which looks quite boring. His transparent
plastic is a tinted clear shade, which looks rather black-ish as well,
adding to this mode's monotony. Trailcutter has a fair number of 5mm ports
in this mode to beef up his weaponrry-- he's got one on the top of his
missile rack, two on the top near the back end, and two on each side of
this mode, near the bottom of the car doors.

    Trailcutter's transformation
to robot mode is fairly simple and straightforward, but it has the intended
effect-- this robot mode is most definitely Trailcutter's, being mostly
his IDW design with a little bit of G1 added in. One of the best things
about this mode is that he's got no vehicle mode extras at all-- even his
roof fits very well on his back without getting in the way visually, and
I love his his chest/front bumper compresses slightly so he's not stuck
with a ridiculously barrel chest or dumpy stomach like his G1 toy. Even
his vehicle mode side mirrors are used as tabs to hold his shoulders in
place! Here also is where some of his mold detailing shines through, such
as on his abs, the lines on his waist and lower arms, and some of his other
general details which give him a bit more visual interest in this mode
than in vehicle mode. His headsculpt is very well-done, with a slight frown
on his face which is indicative of his characterization lately. (Unfortunately,
his light piping doesn't work well due to the missile rack right behind
his head blocking light.) On top of all this, his color scheme here is
considerably more varied than just "all black"; yes, there's a fair amount
of that blah light milky gray plastic, but the orange paint and plastic
looks nice and contrasts very well with the black, and the bits of blue
and silver help add a bit more to his color variety. Trailcutter's general
proportions are pretty good, with his shoulders being a bit overly wide
but otherwise looking quite nice, with a somewhat stocky build, particularly
in the arms. There are two eyesores in this mode, though, and they're rather
big, noticeable gaps on the insides of his lower arms and lower legs, due
to his transformation. It's not quite as obvious here because of the black
plastic, but still... it reminds you once again of the cost cutting measures
Hasbro has implemented recently, and that even though Trailcutter now LOOKS
a normal deluxe's size in this mode, he's still a bit lighter than your
average deluxe. For articulation, Trailcutter can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows (at two points), inwards at the wrists, and at the waist, hips,
(at two points), knees, and slightly forward at the toes. Other than knee
and wrist rotation he's got your poseability ranges covered, and he's very
well-balanced and steady, so he can get into some pretty nice poses. For
a weapon, Trailcutter's upper back half of his vehicle mode pops off to
become either a double-barreled gun or a shield, depending on how you have
him hold it or mount it on the side of his lower arm (there are a few different
handles on the underside of this piece that allow Trailcutter to hold it
different ways). A nice little accessory, though I wish the guns could
move a little.

    Generations Trailcutter
is a decent update for those who have long been wanting a larger modern
version of this character-- he's got a great range of movement, great proportions,
and a complete lack of kibble in BOTH modes. However, he is a bit small/hollow
for a deluxe, and his vehicle mode really needed more paint apps to be
remotely visually interesting. His transformation is also very by-the-book
and nothing that won't wow, though it gets the job done. Mildly recommended,
keeping in mind the aforementioned drawbacks.

      Few Autobots are as well liked as Trailcutter.
He's always ready with a joke or a reassuring word-- and when neither of
those will do, his impenetrable force field usually serves to improve the
situation. He sometimes worries that he uses too much fuel, but the other
Autobots are more than happy to take a smaller Energon ration if it means
Trailcutter can keep deflecting incoming laser blasts.
