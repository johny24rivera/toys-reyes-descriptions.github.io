    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Obi-Wan Kenobi. For

     This version of Darth
Vader is the third use of the Jedi Starfighter mold in less than a year--
a bit overkill, if you ask me. Still, overall, this new paint job looks
great-- the black and gray may not normally be the most eye-catching of
colors, and to be fair there isn't much contrast at all to this paint job,
However, the many black paint apps on the dark gray really help to break
up the usage of the two colors a lot, so that there isn't too much of any
one color on any part of the figure. The lighter gray panels on the wings
with their "worn" paint apps also look great, as well. The silver used
on the R2 unit and the cockpit also contrast very nicely against the silver
and black, and the red serves as a nice "evil" accent color here and there.]

     Two mold changes have
been made to the figure for Darth Vader-- a miniature Vader pilot figure
comes with the toy to fit inside the cockpit, and the Mech mode head has
been changed to resemble Vader's as well. The new head mold is definitely
off, however-- the red, bulbous eyes look really weird on Darth's otherwise
menacing face, and are too high up. In addition, the head is a bit too
skinny as well.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Starfighter Darth
Vader figure is the best version of the mold yet, with a great color scheme
for a Star Wars Transformer and more than enough paint apps to go around.
The only part of the figure that's inferior to the previous two versions
is the head, which is oddly proportioned.

       Newly converted to the dark side, Darth
Vader is given the task of crushing all resistance to the Emperor across
the galaxy. Armed with his new, heavily modified Sith Starfighter and power
of the dark side, he morphs his vehicle into a powerful combat robot. One
barrage of missles from his terrifying war machine and even the fiercest
planet will kneel to the Emperor.
