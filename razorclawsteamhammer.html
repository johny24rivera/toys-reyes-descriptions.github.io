       Razorclaw (presumably
named for his sharp ninja star weapon mode) has a color scheme that works
pretty well for a stealth bomber-- black and a dull blue work very well
for camoflauge colors if you're flying at night! However, having just dull
blue and black would make a somewhat uninteresting color scheme due to
the lack of contrast, so some nice white line paint apps have been added
to the vehicle mode to spice things up a little-- they look really nice.
A silver cockpit and head, as well as red optics, complete the color selection.
It adds a little more contrast to the robot mode, but this mode still looks
a little boring due to the lack of a really good contrasting color.

         Razorclaw has such a passion for destruction
that he prefers strafing ground targets with his powerful machineguns rather
than bombing them from high altitutude. Anarchy is his bread and butter;
he lives to crush his enemies, drive them before them, and here the lamentations
of the survivors. Nothing gives him as much pleasure as destroying a great
city and razing its cultural institutions - libraries, museums, schools
- for he knows that ignorance is the seed of chaos, and it is in chaos
he feels most comfortable.

           Steamhammer, to put it
bluntly, has a rather funky color scheme. The brown and orange, which are
secondary colors, go together fairly well, but the yellow used for the
main color is a rather odd color for a military vehicle. I mean, even a
dull yellow would've worked, but the "normal" yellow used is a bit too
bright for a serious vehicle like this, and the black "camoflauge" patterns
used on top of it would not only be completely ineffectual in real life,
but they look pretty hokey as well. One positive is that the robot face
has the optic visor painted, however, which is a nice detail on such a
small toy.

          <font face="OCR A Extended">
           No mold changes have
been made to Steamhammer, but an Autobot symbol paint app has been added
to the left side of the rear of his vehicle mode. Due to mold degradation
from its many uses, the hinge that connects Steamhammer's upper body with
his lower body is a bit loose, so it tends to come off rather easily during
transformation. A little annoying, but it can easily be popped back on.

             Few enemies are as bitter as Steamhammer
and Razorclaw. Steamhammer took his vehicle form because of a deep love
of life and order. He believes that war is an unnatural disruption of the
organized advance of culture, and does everything he can to limit combat
and defend vulnerable targets. He looks at warfare as a necessary evil,
but one that only does damage to the civilizations that wage it. Despite
his own heroism, he never sees anything but the terrible cost of war at
the conclusion of any battle.

             This Minicon pack, in
terms of paint jobs, has one good paint job and one bad one. Razorclaw,
though a bit dull in robot mode, has the best paint job of any version
of the mold. However, Steamhammer has the worst paint job of his mold,
with a clashy yellow/black "camoflauge" scheme. However, given the average
score, unless you're a completist, you're probably better off buying the
Armada versions of these molds instead.
