    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to G1 Silverstreak. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of G1 Silverstreak

     Smokescreen has actually
had some mold changes done from his predecessors Silverstreak and Prowl.
They're minor mold changes, to be sure- pretty much only his front bumper
and his rear spoiler have been changed- but they're significant enough
to make him a different type of sportscar. And I have to say, I prefer
the look of this vehicle mode over the other ones- and not just because
of the remolded parts. The color scheme itself is very eye-catching- the
dark red and blue mix together wonderfully, and the white stripes add a
nice flair to the overall look as well. The number "38", while not entirely
authentic, still gives him a really nice NASCAR-esque feel. The colors
also worth just as well in robot mode, although the white is a bit more
prevalent than the red.

     Smokescreen is a step
above his mold-brothers, with an improved color scheme and a nice remolding
done to the car mode to keep him from being "just another car repaint".
In fact, the only thing keeping me from recommending him to those of us
who remember G1 is his very steep price and minimal articulation. If you
can get past that, then by all means, buy him.

       Whether Smokescreen is engaged in raging
battle or friendly conversation, an ulterior purpose usually exists. Job
is to lead enemy astray. Sneaky, but charming and affable. Considered most
devious yet most trusted of all Autobot warriors. In car mode, emits thick
smoke from tailpipe. In robot mode, shoots missiles that wreak havoc on
enemy aircraft radar and guidance systems. Electro-disruptor rifle shorts
out electrical targets.
