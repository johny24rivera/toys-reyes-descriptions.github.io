    From a side view, the
1-step changer of Grimlock's "t-rex made of knives" mode doesn't look half
bad, particularly for the subline. The head is quite nicely proportioned
with the horns more prominent and closer to how they look on the movie
than on most of Grimlock's other AoE toys; his arms are fairly proportioned
as well. His tail is just a tad short and his neck-to-stomach area is just
a tad long, but both of these are fairly easily overlooked. He's also got
tons of mold detailing as well, with armor plating and semi-jagged teeth-like
details everywhere. He's got a pretty good amount of paint detailing on
him, with nearly all of his underbelly coated in a nice dark metallic gunmetal
gray that contrasts with his main color of a brownish bronze very well--
sure, it's not movie-accurate, but it DOES look good. The silver on his
face is also placed well, and his blue eyes really stand out against their
surrounding colors. There are a few areas-- his hips and the top of his
tail, mainly-- where another paint app or two would've helped break up
all the brown-bronze, but overall I'm satisfied with this aspect of the
toy. The only robot extras in this mode are the fists obviously visible
on the back of the dino feet, which is fairly minor. However, this mold
has a major flaw in this mode and that's-- well Grimlock's got BACK. From
viewed from any angle remotely approaching a top-view the width of Grimlock's
hips is downright ridiculous, being nearly twice as wide as the rest of
his body, and oversized in terms of their general proportional size as
well. His dino legs are also a bit squat too, but this could simply be
because of how small they look compared to his enormous hip pieces. Grimlock,
sadly, can't move at all in this mode, beyond ever-so-slight side-to-side
articulation at the legs, slightly below the hips.

    To transform Grimlock
to robot mode, you simply take his hip pieces and pull them apart, and
the entire toy auto-transforms from that motion. Grimlock's robot mode
isn't as good as his beast mode, with the proportional maladies multiplying.
His hips were way too wide in beast mode and those pieces-- which are the
shoulders now-- are way too wide in robot mode. His chest is ridiculously
wide as well, and this is made worse by his lower body being a bit skinny
proportionally; most of his legs are merely the halves of the front half
of his t-rex mode split apart slightly, and his waist is made up of only
a few minor plastic bits, with his tailpiece going down the back. That
said, there's certainly SOME positives about this mode. The dark gray plastic
that's seen in this mode is very close to the shade of metallic gunmetal
gray paint used, and both look pretty much like the same color next to
each other. The gray is a bit more prevalent in this mode, adding more
contrast, and Grimlock's headsculpt is pretty spot-on and well-detailed,
with it looking like he's got some teeth behind a partial faceplate-- definitely
a very unique and frightening-looking head, there. The "teeth" detailing
on his chest is also done well, and I love how little parts of his t-rex
head actually rotate around so he has his "knight shoes". His arms also
look pretty good, for what they are. For articulation, Grimlock can move
back-and-forth at the shoulders. Not much movement, but then again that's
not the point of this simplified subline.

    Age of Extinction One-Step
changer Grimlock is my least favorite of his various toys throughout the
line. He certainly has some positives, like a good amount of paint detailing,
some great mold detailing, and a decent color scheme, but all of this is
overshadowed by his severe proportional issues-- most especially his ridiculously
wide hips in t-rex mode and his ridiculously wide shoulders and chest in
robot mode. If you want a simpler toy of the AoE Grimlock design, go for
the Flip 'n Change version instead.
