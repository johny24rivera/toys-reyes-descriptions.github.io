    I was wondering when
they'd get around to making a Y-Wing... well, anyways, the Y-Wing Pilot
is a Clone Wars Y-Wing, not the "classic trilogy" Y-Wing. For the most,
the vehicle mode is pretty solid, with great proportions and some very
nice panel detailing. The dull yellow and white color scheme is boring,
gray seems a bit dark for the windows, but eh. It's what the vehicle looks
like, after all. There is one caveat I have about this mode, and that's
that it can be rather difficult to line up the waist and the legs with
where they're supposed to go (connecting to the back half of the thrusters).
They tend to stick out a bit if looked at from a side-on or rear view.
But other than that and a few minor barely-visible robot joints behind
the cockpit, no mech mode kibble here!

    In mech mode, the Y-Wing
Pilot has some very good parts about him, but also has some of the same
problems plaguing him that many SWTFs have. My main thing about him is
that the backpack pieces made out of the main body of the Y-Wing and the
cockpit just stick out unceremoniously, and doesn't really peg into anything
to keep it from shuffling around slightly when you're playing with the
figure. Plus they pegs that hold those two parts together are shallow at
best. At least they don't impede movement much except a bit in the shoulders.
His other main problem is that his legs are a bit too stiff and stick-like--
there isn't enough clearance between the engine halves that form his upper
and lower legs for some really good movement to try to break out of that
look. The proportions for his upper body, arms, and head are GREAT, though,
and have some great mold detailing, too. The paint details on his chest
and head sculpt are done very nicely, but the lack of any on his arms is
kind of glaring. The addition of some gray and black helps to break up
his dull yellow &amp; white color scheme a little, but there's not enough
of it in my opinion, and he still looks rather boring in that respect.
As for articulation, Y-Wing Pilot's gotcha covered there-- he can move
at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), wrists,
hips (at four points), knees (at two points), waist, and ankles (at two
points). Again though, his knees can be stiff and his shoulders are hampered
a bit in their movement by the backpack-- but generally he can pull off
some pretty cool poses. For a weapon, the front part of the Y-Wing comes
off and can be held in his hand, becoming a spring-loaded missile launcher.

    SWTF Y-Wing Pilot is
an above-average Star Wars Transformer, but that's not to say there certainly
aren't better molds out there. He has one major annoyance in both modes--
both of them dealing with the other mode's kibble-- but otherwise he's
a fairly solid toy. Mildly recommended.

      Piloting a Y-wing fighter, the clone
pilot strafes the ground with missiles, destroying most of the battle droids
on the ground. But he's not yet finished: the pilot changes the Y-wing
into a huge mech that obliterates all the remaining battle droids!
