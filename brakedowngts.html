    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Brakedown.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Brakedown

     Brakedown GTS is an homage
to the G1 character Kup-- and it's not just mere coincidence, I know this
because, according to the special info called up when you enter his Cyber
Key Code on
     <a href="http://www.transformers.com/">
      Transformers.com
     </a>
     ,
the toy was originally going to be called Kup, but I guess they couldn't
get the name back or something. Anyways, this mold is a good toy to repaint
into Kup, given that Brakedown is the "old timer" character of the Cybertron
line. Brakedown GTS shares the general Kup color scheme of light blue,
dark blue, and gray, but adds in a few more colors to help make the toy
look more attractive. And that's Brakedown GTS' main drawing point-- he's
got a few more, evenly-placed paint apps than the first Brakedown had.
The dark red stripe patterns on the lower legs and above the rear vehicle
wheels are the most obvious new apps, but a few other minor ones have been
added as well around the chest and waist area. The greenish-golden paint
apps on the legs ands lower arms look especially cool, and the silver-painted
helmet on the robot head looks very nice against the blue face-- I wish
the silver had continued onto his beard, though, as his blue beard looks
rather odd. As far as the general color scheme goes, however, it just doesn't
measure up nearly as well as Brakedown's original colors did. The light
blue, dark blue, black, and gray don't outright clash, but it doesn't look
nearly as sleek as the original colors, and the light greenish blue is
a tad gaudy.

     No mold changes have
been made to Brakedown GTS.

     Brakedown GTS is a nice
homage to Kup, but taken by itself, the color scheme doesn't look nearly
as nice and well put-together as the original Brakedown, so unless you're
a big Kup fan, I'd spring for the original version before this GTS upgrade
any day of the week.

       It's long been an accepted piece of
wisdom on Velocitron that you can't teach an old racer new tricks, but
that was before the Autobots came to the Speed Planet. With the help of
Coby and the intelligent application of some Earth technology, including
dual superchargers, inter-cooled Energon exhaust ports and a diamond-sharp
edge to his racing saber, Brakedown is feeling a thousand years younger.
Yes sir, this old speed demon is back on the track!
