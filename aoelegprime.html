    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RotF Legends class Optimus Prime

     Well, I guess with Wal-Mart
exclusives Hasbro wasn't planning on making any new molds, because this
definitely isn't Optimus'
     <i>
      Age of Extinction
     </i>
     design; it's his design
from the previous three movies. Heck, in vehicle mode it's even DONE UP
in the same color scheme that he had in the previous three movies, with
the front section being red with the blue flames instead more of him being
blue like in his new design. It's quite obviously Optimus' regular color
scheme, mostly being re-released for those who weren't able to get it the
first couple of times. There are some minor differences between this one
and the initial release; namely, a little less paint! Well, okay, that
sounded a little too negative, even though he DOES have a little less paint;
the robot chest specifically should have more red and/or silver on it.
The paint on the lower arms is blue now as opposed to red, and the robot
knees are now unpainted gray plastic, with an Autobot symbol on them instead.
There's also fewer flames on the front in truck mode. On the upside, the
upper legs are painted black now, so that's something. As far as plastic
colors go, the gray has a slight blue tinge to it, though it's still in
the same "realm" of colors as with the gray on most other Movie Optimus
toys. The blue is also just the teensiest bit brighter. Aaand... that's
it. This is more of a variant than your usual themed redeco.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Optimus.

     AoE "Legion" Optimus
Prime certainly isn't going to satisfy fans looking for a teeny version
of the AoE design, but if you haven't gotten the nifty RotF Legends class
Optimus Prime yet, here's your chance, and with a relatively accurate color
scheme too (though not QUITE as accurate as the usage of the mold that
comes with the Wal-Mart exclusive Grimlock 2-pack).
