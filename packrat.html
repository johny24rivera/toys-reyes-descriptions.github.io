    Beast mode is a blue
rat. While it has an odd color combination, it still looks very nice. The
white lever, though, sticks out a bit, and his legs, mouth, and head don't
move at all. His tail and feet do, though. He has a nice menacing sneer
on his face, like you would expect a fearsome rat to have.

    Robot mode is nicely
sculpted and has a nice color scheme, but his extras get in the way a lot.
His large rat "backpack" on his back is so large and heavy that it can
sometimes can pull him backwards, making it hard for this ratbot to stand
up. His gun is small and get lost easily, also.

      Packrat is the ultimate glory hound.
His penchant for stealing is surpassed only by his desire to let everyone
know he did it. The other Maximals are tolerant of his sneaky and deceptive
ways only because he's an effective fighter, and because he causes the
Predacons more trouble than he does his comrades. His standing with his
teammates reached a crossroad with the Energon armor incident. As Rhinox
has said, "There may be hope for him yet."
