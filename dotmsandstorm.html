    Sandstorm's vehicle mode
is some sort of rather angular dune buggy. Although you wouldn't mistake
it for a real dune buggy, there's enough simliarities here where it's pretty
easy to see that's what they're going for. Generally this is a pretty solid
mode, though there's almost no clearance in between the bottom and the
wheels, and it's fairly obvious that the rear tailpipe-thrusters are just
Sandstorm's robot arms in a contorted position. The very top of his head
also sticks out the top of this mode behind the seat, though the gun that
comes with a 5 mm clip (and thus can be clipped on many other TFs with
those kind of ports) helps to hide this if you look at him from the right
angle. The quality is pretty good, though sometimes you have to bend the
front handlebars a little more than I'm comfortable with to get them to
peg together for this mode. Sandstorm's color scheme is pretty standard
jungle-esque military fare, and it all looks pretty good (and fitting)
on a Human Alliance vehicle like this one. I wish the green were a tad
darker, but otherwise everything contrasts and fits with the theme without
looking boring. (There's also a bit of that blah light milky gray, but
thankfully it's limited to just a few parts in robot mode.) The mold detailing
is pretty good, with lots of pistons and ridges on such places as behind
the seat, near the tailpipes, as well as some well-detailed tires and front
bumper pieces. The paint detailing isn't anything spectacular, but it does
what's needed and breaks up most of the large mono-color spaces on Sandstorm--
the light blue headlights look particularly good in this mode. Sandstorm's
human partner, Private Dedcliff, is a big blonde guy that looks kind of
like Bill Faggerbakke. He has all the standard movement that any of the
Human Alliance partner figures have; no surprises there.

    Sandstorm's weapon mode
is... pretty dumb. Part of the back end opens up to reveal missile pack
detailing, and the transformation revolves around positioning the other
parts of Sandstorm loosely around said missile pack while providing a place
for his human partner to sit on top and a handle for (much) larger Transformers
to hold him along the bottom of the mode. The missile pack detailing is
pretty nice-- the red is a particularly striking color against the silver
paint-- and the tailpipes make for decent side guns, but other than that
this mode is pretty nonsensical. The entire front part of the vehicle mode
just hangs off the back end unceremoniously here, and the top part folds
down to hang unceremoniously off the bottom. So... lots of unceremonious
hanging, here. On a lesser note, why would you have the human figure sit
ABOVE the missile pack? His feet dangle right in front of the danger zone!

    Sandstorm's robot mode,
on the other hand, is pretty cool-looking and the highlight of his three
modes. Proportionally he's quite good (though his upper arms could be a
BIT thicker), and I love how the seat folds up to become some very cool
chest detailing. The wheels stay on the sides of the shoulders and feet,
both framing the figure's silouhette and keeping out of the way. His head
sculpt is also quite cool, having a swept back look to it with some really
nice red detailing that looks especially good next to the light blue eyes.
His articulation is also excellent-- he can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows, slightly at the wrists, and at the waist, hips, knees, and ankles
(at two points). Many of these are on ball joints, so you can get some
great poses out of Sandstorm, particularly with his wide feet and ball-jointed
ankles. All this said, although it's a small backpack piece, having two
of his handlebar rods simply hanging out there behind his back strikes
me as a definite weak/easy-to-crack point that I worry a bit about. (The
rods in front of his shoulders also are only connected to the main body
at the stomach, but they don't stick out from the body nearly as far.)

    Sandstorm has the best
mold from the Human Alliance deluxes. His weapon mode is junk and best
ignored-- as can be said of most of the weapon modes in this subline--
but his vehicle mode is pretty good with only a few kibble extras and his
robot mode is one of the best from this subline. Highly recommended, with
a footnote to keep an eye on those handlebar pieces sticking out there
in robot and weapon modes.

      Sandstorm was built to survive for extended
periods in the harshest climates. Anything Earth can throw at him, he can
endure and come out smiling. He requires the same fortitude from his human
partner, Private Dedcliff, a Special Forces wilderness survival expert
with years of experience. Together, they hunt Decepticons in the most remote
places on the planet.
