    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance deluxe
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot
Alliance deluxe Optimus Prime

     The deluxe "G2" Autobot
Alliance Optimus finally gets his inevitable Scourge redeco as a part of
the initial offering of the Transformers Club's "Subscription Service".
The club clearly went out of their way to get this toy as accurate to the
original toy's deco as possible-- the black is pitch black, the gray has
a little bit of glitter mixed in with it, and the teal outlines on the
truck and robot mode are perfectly done and very smooth. The silver and
red helps to round out the color scheme of the 'con who led to innumerable
"Nemesis Prime" repaints in later Transformers series, and it all ends
up looking quite nice. The teal lines and silver smokestacks and red windows
all make sure that no large portion of Scourge is simply black, but always
has a nice contrast color nearby. His head is particularly intricately
detailed to the point of being quite impressive. What's surprising is that
Scourge has the upside-down G2 Autobot symbols that the Decepticons had
in the Japanese "Car Robots" cartoon, whereas stateside they were simply
released with normal Decepticon logos. Personally, I would've included
both just to cover all your bases, but it's still a nice little touch regardless.

     No mold changes have
been made to Scourge, beyond the shortening of one of the shoulder connector
tabs that's been done to all but the initial mass release of this mold,
which allows for better shoulder movement.

     Scourge is a wonderfully
done and well-painted homage to the original RiD character, but honestly--
I'm not so sure why this toy seems to be the runaway hit of the 2013 Subscription
Service. Yes, it's as well-done as you could get (well, minus the lack
of the silver-black paint patters on Scourge's shoulders, likely taken
away because there's too much molded-in detail there), but it's a small
deluxe toy that's a bit bothersome to transform. If it was mass-release
and available for retail, I could easily see the reason for its popularity.
However, it's already a high-end toy due to its exclusive nature, and a
cursory search on eBay as of this writing (5/14) shows that the original
will probably cost you just about the same-- if not less-- than this one,
and the original was a fantastic toy that was much larger and came with
an entire weapons base. If you want a RiD Scourge, as good as this redeco
is I'd try to get the original toy first before looking for this one.

       Cunning, dangerous, and cruel, Scourge
is a no-nonsense field commander charged with leading his army into battle.
Although he shows little compassion for his troops, he shows even less
for the enemy as he swings his signature "Sword of Fury" blade relentlessly
towards the opposition, seeking to wreak as much bodily damage as possible.
Should that fail to deliver the final blow, a barrage attack from his four
shoulder-mounted missile launchers will end the fight with definitive results.

       Formed when multiple personalities--
including the heroic Optimus Prime-- were simultaneously scanned, Scourge
rarely speaks of his origins. He detests them. He seeks to one day rectify
the "mix-up" during his creation by slicing through the Autobot Commander's
armor plating and extinguishing the spark of life within.
