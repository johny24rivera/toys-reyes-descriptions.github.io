    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime voyager
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Unlike most of the other
"Dark Energon" redecos of the Prime characters, Megatron's color scheme
doesn't seem to be a callback to anything in particular-- it's just him
in more typical "Decepticon-y" colors-- namely purple and black. That's
not all that there is to this scheme, though-- there's a lot of subtle
changes to that typical scheme that help make this redeco stand out. For
one, the main plastic color of purple is actually a really light, semi-lavender
shade of the color. That in itself is hardly fitting for the menacing Decepticon
leader, but it blends EXCELLENTLY with the two other main colors-- a greenish
black that's just enough green where it actually looks like burnished black
metal, and is one of the few instances where I prefer a more "impure" black
over a purer shade of the color. This shade of black allows Megatron to
actually have TWO different shades of the color on his chest/nosecone--
the sides are painted black, while the greenish black plastic in the center
of the chest is kept on the parts that are molded with the detailing that
make it look like they've been run over with a steel wood pad, and it just
looks great in a way that's very hard to show in pictures, unfortunately.
Megatron's other major color here is-- again-- a shade of purple, but it's
a transparent dark purple, one that both complements the lavender in a
way, but is dark enough to contrast against it while still keeping in with
the Dark Energon subline's theme of transparent plastic. There is a bit
of middle-of-the-road (in terms of its hue) transparent purple on other
areas of Megs, such as on his Powerizer weapon and on his chest interior
and eye light piping-- the latter of which works marvelously well. There's
also a tad of that boring light milky gray plastic, but thankfully it's
just on his hands, feet, and kneecaps, so it's not at all widespread like
on the original release of this mold. His paint apps aren't widespread,
but his color scheme is generally varied enough where this doesn't matter--
and the places where the paint apps are used, they're used well. The silver
on the face and chest look nice, and the purplish pink is a nice bright
color that contrasts against the black while complimenting the lavender
very well. If the pink were used too much, it would make the toy look oddly
loud, but as it is, it makes for a great accent color. Like the other Dark
Energon Decepticons, he also has his Decepticon symbol with a metallic
purple "X" slash symbol behind it next to his "head hole" in vehicle mode,
and it looks great against the black.

     No mold changes have

     "Dark Energon" Megatron
is a fantastic repaint of an okay mold, greatly upping the eye-drawing
factor of the toy, especially when you consider how generally dull his
original, show-accurate color scheme is. Color-wise, this is my favorite
version of this mold, though the Sharkticon version's detailing, vehicle
mode, and accessories are admittedly better. If you're in for "themed"
redecos, this is definitely one I'd recommend picking up.

       With the power of Dark Energon coursing
through his circuitry, Megatron gains a diabolical control over the reanimated
wrecks of fallen robots. He exercises this new ability with complete ruthlessness,
returning Autobots and Decepticons alike to terrifying half life as relentless
Terrorcons.
