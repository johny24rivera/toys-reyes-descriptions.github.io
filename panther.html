    Beast mode is a panther.
This robot has no name, and is referred to only as "Panther". This mode
looks awkward, the tail no more than a stub. His main body looks very chunky
and wide, his underside making him look like a panther that had his underside
glued to a sheet of metal. His legs are articulated, however, which is
rare for a Happy Meal toy.

    Robot mode looks even
more awkward than the beast mode. His main body looks decent, but his appendages
are seriously messed up. His "hands" are just backwards-facing feet, as
well as his robot feet. This mode is very poorly constructed.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    So-so in beast mode,
but is awkward-looking, especially in robot mode, like he took someone
else's appendages and stuck them on his body in the wrong places.
