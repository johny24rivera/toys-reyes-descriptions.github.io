    Duststorm's vehicle mode
is a crane. This mode is generally alright, but it does suffer from some
noticeable problems, For one thing-- and this is probably the most annoying
of Duststorm's downsides-- is that his robot head is pretty clearly visible
in this mode, directly under his rear windows. The designers try to cover
it up by turning the head towards the main body of the crane, but the shape
doesn't quite mesh with the crane body, and it's a different color, so
it really doesn't work at all. It's just... right there. Also, Duststorm's
upper robot legs are obviously connecting the two halves of his vehicle
mode, and again, they don't mesh with the square look of the crane-- they're
round and skinny. Hasbro should have engineered it so the legs slided into
the upper or lower half of the crane body and out of the way-- given Duststorm's
transformation, it really wouldn't have been very hard. My other complaints
are more minor, and involve Duststorm's color scheme-- the powder-blue
and blue-black color scheme isn't bad by itself, but it really isn't very
fitting for a rough-and-tumble crane, especially one named Duststorm. Oh,
and the bright red painted windows are kind of gaudy, too. That's not to
say that Duststorm doesn't have some definite pluses, though-- I do love
the extendable crane arm on a toy as small as a basic, and the energon
claw weapon is pretty darn cool. The overall proportions are also very
close to perfect as well, and he has a great deal of mold detailing.

    Duststorm's robot mode
is a bit better than his vehicle mode. For one thing, his articulation
is great- he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points), elbows, waist,
hips, and knees. So pretty much anywhere, really. He also doesn't have
any useless kibble hanging off him, though his right lower arm is just
molded on the bottom of a vehicle mode piece, so it's not a "hand" in the
literal sense. Also, as you've no doubt noticed, Duststorm's left arm is
his crane arm. And it's ridiculously long when compared to the rest of
the body-- even when it's retracted, it's nearly two times as long as the
rest of Duststorm's body. The Energon claw helps a little, but it still
looks rather odd. Oh, and his hip joints are rather loose, though this
could just be mine. Another plus in this mode helps balance all this out,
though-- compared to, say, many of the Energon Autobots, Duststorm has
pretty good proportions (excluding his crane-arm). They're spot-on, man.
Get rid of the crane arm and put it on his shoulder or something, and this
mode would get an A, really. That crane arm is the only major thing dragging
down this mode. Duststorm's Decepticon spark crystal is on the part of
his crane arm slightly below the shoulder, and he has one Powerlinx port,
on the end of said crane arm.

    According to his instructions,

    Duststorm's crane arm
hampers his robot mode some, and he does have some visible robot extras
in vehicle mode. His color scheme is also a bit iffy. But pretty much all
his other aspects I have no complaints on. So I consider Duststorm a step
above "so-so", but a step below "great". My least recommended of the Energon
gestalt limbs, but practically all of the gestalt limbs are great molds,
so there you go.
