not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Voyager Starscream.

        Sunstorm here is an homage
to the somewhat recently-named yellow "Seeker" in G1 who made a background
appearance now and then. In Animated, though, he's more than just background
cameo character-- he's a bonafide suck-up Starscream clone! The color scheme
follows Sunstorm's fairly closely, with a bright yellowish orange being
a main color and white being a main accent color. More dull red is used
on Animated Sunstorm than on the previous Sunstorm redecoes, however (if
it was used at all on those previous repaints). I like the addition of
more red, as this is a rather loud color scheme, and using more of a darker
color helps to tone it down slightly. It still is rather loud, though,
all things considered. I do like the transparent cherry red, though-- particularly
on the cockpit, where it's outlined in white paint. Sunstorm has some rather
major paint app QA issues, however. Usually you can find a Transformer
figure now and then that has bad paint, but from reports on the web it's
apparently quite hard to find a Sunstorm that DOESN'T have bad paint. The
lines are uneven or "off" slightly, and there isn't a thick enough coat
of paint on the figure in regards to the white and dark red paint-- the
orange "shows through" a little, particularly on the former. It's a real
shame, as it makes the figure look a bit amateurish and messy.

        Sunstorm is a nice enough
homage to the obscure G1 Seeker of the same name, but the loud color scheme,
combined with the sloppy paint apps, and medicore mold make this a pick-up
only for Seeker fans or fans of the character-- particularly if you already
have Activators Ratchet. Easily my least favorite of this mold's color
schemes.

          Yet another clone of Starscream has
appeared on Earth to threaten the Autobots. Sunstorm is a cackling madman,
determined to destroy everything in his path. He is also a living power
battery, absorbing any energy directed at him, from sunlight to high-powered
lasers. Only Ratchet has the scientific know-how to develop a device capable
of defeating such a powerful new enemy.
