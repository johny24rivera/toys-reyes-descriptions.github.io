    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     Thrust's color scheme
is taken pretty much bit-for-bit from his G1 toy, which had a great color
scheme in the first place, so I'm not complaining. Black and dark dull
red make for a decent color scheme, and all the myriad paint apps Thrust
has really make it stand out, particularly the silver and orange/yellow
bits. In jet mode, he admittedly looks a tad dull, given he doesn't have
as many paint apps showing, and instead of having the really cool colorful
stripes that the Classics Seekers, he has the slavish G1 small stripes
on his wings, which don't look nearly as interesting. Still, particularly
in robot mode his color scheme is catching-- they certainly spared no expense
on the paint apps.

     They spared no expense
on the mold changes, either-- Thrust is the most heavily-modified Botcon
exclusive ever as of the date this review was written (9/08). He shares
the slightly-changed transformation that
     <a href="clasramjet.html">
      Classics
Ramjet
     </a>
     shared, with the same "conehead", but in addition the tailfins
and the main wings have ALL been remolded to more closely resemble Thrust's
classic turbine wings. Very impressive effort, and I have to commend the
Botcon folks on doing something this big. However... the wings are too
small proportionally, particularly the main wings. Compared to the other
Seekers, Thrust's wings just look tiny in comparision, so the remolding
doesn't come off quite as well as planned. (Also, because of the remolding,
Thrust has the wings behind his arms in robot mode like Starscream, as
opposed to behind his legs like Ramjet.)

     Thrust has a great color
scheme with lots of paint apps and is a pretty solid mold. However, though
the considerable effort to remold Thrust's wings is definitely appreciated,
it comes up a bit short as they're too small proportionally. I like him
a bit better than Thundercracker color-wise, but not quite as much as Dirge.

       Perhaps it was for no other reason than
he was the last of all Decepticons to be re-activated by Megatron, but
when Thrust was presented with the opportunity, he was eager to join Bludgeon's
faction. Honestly, crazy old Megatron scares the coolant out of him. He'd
rather be part of a nice, big army, where he can be surrounded by weaker
bots, and push around the locals of whatever planet they occupy that week.
