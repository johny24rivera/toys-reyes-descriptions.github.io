    Beast mode is a hornet.
This beast mode is nice, except his back insect legs are his robot legs
folded out, so they look like mutated hooves. His hands are also kind of
visible in this mode too from the underside. The articulation in this mode
is very limited, since only the wings and back legs can move. The detailing
isn't very good on this toy, either.

    Robot mode is nice,
but with some extras. His front two insect legs stick out a lot and get
in the way some, and his insect abdomen also gets in the way a little.
His hornet face halves are nicely placed and he has two heads: a "mutant"
head like
    <a href="waspinator.html">
     Waspinators
    </a>
    , and a face that looks
like an Autobots. His stinger becomes a missle launcher and parts of his
wings can become missles.

    A nicely done deluxe
in robot mode, but the beast mode isn't all that great. A repaint of Waspinator,
although the coloring isn't quite as nice.

      Hunts enemy Maximals from altitudes

of flight. Known to gang-up on its victims with its evil partner, the wicked
