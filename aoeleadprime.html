    Optimus Prime's leader
class form's vehicle fits his on-screen appearnace quite well; by and large,
the proportions are pretty on-the-mark, though the back end of the cab
looks just a TAD longer than it actually is in the movie, though this just
a very minor "stretching"-- he still looks just fine. There's also no robot
mode extras visible in this mode at all, always a good thing. (That said,
the back end of the cab is a bit hollow, given the sliders to shorten it
during the transformation-- you can see through a good amount of it from
a top view.) By and large the mold detailing in this mode is pretty sparse--
as is keeping with Prime's new Western Star truck mode, which is rather
windswept for such a large vehicle-- though some parts have some more intricate
detailing, such as the front grill, the side "steps" up to the driver windows,
and the wheels, which have little Autobot symbols molded in the hubs--
a nice little extra touch. The color scheme is classic movie Prime, though
in this mode less emphasis is given to the gray and more to the blue. The
red flame paint apps on the front and middle of the mode look pretty ace,
though being against so dark a color already they don't contrast quite
as much as I wish they would have-- the blue "bleeds through" the red a
bit. In place of (most of) the gray in this mode is a nice silver chrome--
I haven't seen any major chipping issues on mine, and the chrome is used
in appropriate places (such as the smokestacks, front grill, and the like),
and I quite like it; it gives this mode a bit of a visual flair, when color-wise
it would've looked a tad plain otherwise. (The top of the truck mode and
the back end in particular could've used some more paint apps.) There is
also a touch of translucent yellow used for the windows-- honestly a rather
odd color for windows, but it does contrast nicely against the surrounding
colors. Optimus has two weapons-- a translucent yellow sword with a painted
handle, which slides in neatly into a slot on the bottom of this mode and
thus out of the way. However, it does tend to wiggle around in that slot
a little, so I wish the fit was a bit more firm. Optimus' other weapon
can double as either a shield of a gun, depending on how you orient it--
a pretty ingenious idea, I must say. It stores on the top of the back end
of this mode, which may look a little odd, but this does help to mask all
the gaps in said back end. Although I like the red paint apps on this weapon,
the rest of it is of that blah light milky gray plastic that I rather despise
is being used so much on TFs these days when a more metallic-looking shade
of the color would look much better.

    Optimus' transformation
to robot mode definitely takes some major design cues from his
    <a href="aoe1stedprime.html">
     First
Edition figure
    </a>
    , but takes a few things a couple of extra steps further,
resulting in slightly better compression/hiding of his vehicle mode parts
in robot mode. SLIGHTLY being the operative word here-- there's still a
large backpack made up of the back third or so of his truck mode on his
back, the shoulder pads are definitely overly large, and the wheels and
bits on the back of his feet are also pretty obviously truck parts, though
at least the latter bits stick to his general silhouhette. In a new twist,
parts of the sides of his truck mode rotate out a bit to become sort of
"skirt armor". It's not movie-accurate, but it's a better idea than simply
sticking even more onto Prime's backpack. Optimus' "core" robot mode proportions
are pretty good in this mode-- granted, his chest could be a bit beefier
and his arms a bit thicker, but being realistic when looking at his movie
design, that would be pretty darned hard to implement. His color variation
is much better in this mode, with all the blue being broken up much better
with red, silver, and blue paint apps, along with more-dominant light milky
gray (bleh). Part of his chest is also chrome, with both red and dark blue
chrome, which looks mighty nice, even if the details on them aren't completely
movie-accurate. Speaking of the details, Prime's sculpting is very well-done,
with (mostly) movie-accurate mechanical, segmented armor all over him,
which generally gives him a more "solid-looking" appearance than his previous
movie design-- and given that it's movie-accurate, I can hardly fault Hasbro
for that. Some parts like the fingers are incredibly intricately detaile,d
with little knuckle hinges molded in and the like. The headsculpt is also
pretty spot-on, and has his faceplate molded in the down position. For
articulation, in this mode Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders (at
three points-- six if you include his shoulder panels), elbows (at two
points), rotation at the thumb, and movement at the hips (at two points,
with one of them being nice, thick ratchets to support his weight), knees
(at two points-- again, one with a heavy ratchet), and ankles (at a point
that not only allows them to rotate some, but also swivel a bit to keep
Optimus' feet flat on the ground if he's in an "A" stance). Optimus can
also move at the waist, but you have to lift his skirt piece to do so,
which just looks weird, so that's pretty unfortunate. When it comes to
equpping his weapons, Optimus can hold his sword in either hand by rotating
the thumb open and slotting the sword in firmly at the handle before closing
up the thumb again-- Optimus' grip is iron-tight this time, which I wholeheartedly
approve of. The sword can also sheathe behind his back, using the same
slot used for storage in vehicle mode. As for his shield-gun, he has a
port on the side of his right lower arm (why only the right?) where you
can position it forward for a gun or vertically for a shield. Unfortunately,
he can't hold his shield in his actual hands, though.

    Age of Extinction Leader
class Optimus Prime is the best design you're going to get of this character
in the line, but that doesn't mean he's flawless. His truck mode is largely
pretty darned good, albeit lacking a bit in paint apps and having a hollow
back end. His robot mode is decent, but suffers a lot from all the vehicle
kibble (albeit less so than his First Edition version), much of which can
interfere with his otherwise good amount of articulation. Recommended,
but more because this is the best transformable representation you're going
to get of this intergral character as opposed to the awesomeness of the
toy itself.
