    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Scourge. For

     Odd that the only homage
in Universe 2.0 to the Robots in Disguise series of Transformers would
come as a throwback to a character that wasn't even in the TV series--
heck,
     <a href="bruticus.html">
      RiD Bruticus
     </a>
     was a Beast Machines "leftover".
Still, it's kinda cool to see obscure characters get nods too, and though
Universe 2.0 Bruticus here is just a redeco, the three-headed wingless
dragon alt mode is a fairly close fit to the cerberus beast mode of the
original RiD Bruticus toy. As expected, Universe 2.0 Bruticus' colors are
a throwback to his RiD versions'-- red and yellow are major colors, with
some nice purple thrown in there too. However, the red's noticeably lighter
and the yellow noticeably darker and duller. (Which in my opinion is good--
having both of those colors light would have looked kinda loud, in my opinion.)
The purple is also lighter as well, though it looks good as a more "violet"
color. The colors don't stop there, though-- several new colors have been
added to give a bit more variety to the larger-size figure. Brown is the
main addition, with the horns, upper rear legs, and top of the dragon heads
all being brown with a very nice-looking gold fade paint app on each of
the brown plastic pieces. Some reddish brown has also been added for the
rear legs, and just in case you think he didn't have enough colors already,
Bruticus has quite a few paint apps, particularly on his legs. Particularly
in beast mode, there ends up being a bit TOO many colors, however. There's
being a striking figure, and then there's just being a toy with a bazillion
colors of paint thrown at it without any real unifying theme. I think the
reddish brown is really what makes the toy go into "too many colors" territory,
though concnetrating the main colors into certain areas of the figure more
would've helped as well. Still, at least none of the colors outright clash.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe 2.0 Bruticus-- none of the electronic sounds have
been changed, either.

Bruticus is an appreciated homage to an obscure RiD character, and one
can hardly fault him for not being visually interesting. However, he simply
has TOO MANY different colors and varied paint apps going on-- there's
nothing unifying, he's just a big splash of colors, and although it's better
than boring I also think it isn't as good as a really well-done color scheme,
even if that color scheme has considerably fewer colors in it. Recommended
over the original Cybertron Scourge, but not over

       With three slobbering, ferocious heads,
and only one brain to split between them all, Predacon Bruticus is a perfect
dungeon guard. Short-tempered, brutal, and unimaginative, he takes his
job of guarding Autobot prisoners very seriously. Megatron doesn't trust
him to do anything beyond serve as a guard, but he is content in the dark,
stinking dungeons beneath the Predacon leader's headquarters. As long as
he has a full complement of prisoners to look after and a steady supply
of energy, Predacon Bruticus is happy.
