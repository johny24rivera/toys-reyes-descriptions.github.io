    Blackout's vehicle mode,
which is a Sikorsky Pave Low helicopter, is one of the Fast Action Battlers
that Hasbro arbitrarily decided to deform a bit while leaving other Fast
Action Battlers rather accurate. I'm not sure why-- maybe for transformation
or design purposes-- but the "kiddiness" deformation isn't too bad, especially
compared to a few other of the Fast Action Battlers, and there's tons of
mold detailing all over the place, which helps him look less like he's
aimed at the Playskool crowd and more like he's aimed at kids a bit older
than that. His overall colors are rather dull, but they're realistic, which
is certainly what the movie line is aimed at-- and the black and blue go
together fairly well anyways, so I can't really complain. He really could
use some more paint detailing in this mode, though-- a couple of tiny yellow
stripes on his wings comprise the only bright color used in this mode.
Blackout does have a few rather obvious robot extras-- particularly his
robot feet on the rear end of this mode, though the bottoms of his robot
hands are also rather visible sticking out of the back end of his wings.
His shoulder joints are rather loose as well, which means that his arms
can fall out from below his wings a bit easier than I'd like. Both of his
rotors spin exceptionally well, however, and he has the standard spring-loaded
missile launcher on the front of this mode, which you launch by pressing
in a black button located under his cockpit.

    Blackout's robot mode
is fairly good for a FAB, with fairly solid proportions (with the exception
of his head, which, although well-detailed, is WAY too big proportionally,
and it also doesn't stick out of the top his chest quite enough). The mold
detailing is, again, excellent, especially on the legs, and the few silver
paint apps he has helps to liven up this mode a bit more than his alt mode.
His vehicle parts are rather visible, especially on his shoulders and the
helicopter tail rotor sticking out of his back, but they stay out of the
way of movement well enough so I don't mind them much. Blackout's articulation
is fair, but not particularly great-- he can move at the shoulders (at
two points), hips, knees, ankles, and he also has the same "you can only
turn my waist to the left, but as soon as you let go it snaps back into
its origianl postion" movement that most of the other Fast Action Battlers
do. He doesn't have any elbow movement, which he really needs. Just like
in vehicle mode, however, his shoulder joints have trouble locking in place,
though it's not quite as annoying in this mode. As far as weapons go, Blackout's
rotor can be held in his left hand as a sawblade-style weapon, though you
have to take the missile out of his chest if you want to spin his rotor-weapon
without it smacking into the missile. What's also really cool is that another
(non-firing) gun can flip over Blackout's back and onto the top of his
chest, mimicking the pop-out chest gun that appeared for one brief scene
in the movie.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Gyro Blade Blackout
is one of the better FABs, though he still does suffer from a few problems
like loose shoulder movement and an oddly big robot head. I'd still recommend
the mainline
    <a href="movblackout.html">
     Voyager class Blackout
    </a>
    over
this toy, but if you don't feel like spending $20 on a toy of him or if
you're buying one for a youngster who probably couldn't transform Voyager
class Blackout, this is a fine substitute.

he is almost invulnerable to the weapons of the Autobots, and so strong
