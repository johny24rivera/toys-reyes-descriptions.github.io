    Sideways' vehicle mode
is a Kawasaki motorcycle- says so right on the package, in fact, with the
Kawasaki logo and all. Anyways, this mode is pretty darn neat. Although
I'm not a big proponent of yellow on Transformers, it looks rather good
along with the black and silver on this guy, and it's not too bright, either.
Although there's really only three main colors on this 'bot, there's enough
varied paint detailing where you really don't notice at all. However, an
oddity about this toy is that the yellow parts aren't made up of yellow
plastic, but, instead, are black plastic parts painted entirely yellow.
I have absolutely no idea why it turned out this way, as the yellow paint
may tend to wear over time, and just solid yellow plastic would have been
better. Anyway, the mode itself looks very great from either side. Very
sleek and realistic, with great mold detailing where need be. The robot
fist on the bottom sticks out a little, but it's not that big of a deal.
The only thing that does rather irk me about this mode is that it's not
symmetrical. Yes, I know that most motorbikes aren't completely symmetrical,
because they have their exhaust pipes on one side, but I mean besides that.
The mid section sticks out slightly (but not too much) on one side, while
it doesn't on the other. The front and back wheels also only have one part
connecting them to the motorcycle, instead of two, like on most motorcycles.
Because of this odd asymmetry, the motorcycle looks a tad off from the
front. What's really cool is the electronic feature in this mode, which
is amazing it's even included on such a small toy; press the button between
Sideways' handlebars, and a "chainsaw"-like extension connected to his
back wheel lights up. It lights up pretty strong, too, so that's good-
no "faint lights that don't work" here. Sideways' obviously doesn't stand
up that well by himself in this mode, having only two wheels, but he does
have a kickstand attached, so that works pretty well to stabilize him.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Sideways' robot mode
is also very cool-looking. The wheels on the shoulders complement this
mode quite a bit, instead of hindering it a bit. Sideways' face looks very
"ninja-esque", and the mostly-black color scheme helps this look out even
more. Sideways' chainsaw blade attaches to the side of his right hand via
a peg in this mode, so more light-up goodness there. The main body of the
motorcycle also stays hidden on his back pretty well, and doesn't get in
the way much either. The "shield" on the bottom of his right hand looks
a bit odd, though, as does the kick stand on the bottom of his left hand.
There's also a noticeable gap between the bottom of his chest and the beginning
of his waist, which detracts from the look a little as well. Sideways'
wire connecting his chainsaw to his electronics pack gets in the way of
movement quite a bit on his right arm, hindering poses in that area. Sideways'
legs are functional and articulate, but they tend to snap off a bit too
easily during transformation, so be careful. Still, the overall look of
this mode is pretty darn cool.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Sideways is definitely
a cool-looking transformer in both modes, but he has a few too many flaws
(such as the odd asymmetry of his bike mode or his restricted movement
in his arms in 'bot mode) for him to be in the "must-buy" category of 9.0
or above. A worthwhile transformer to buy, at the least.

      Sideways was recruited from Cybertron
when Fortress Maximus was discovered on Earth. This conscientious, ninja-like
warrior races to battle in his newly adopted sports bike disguise exceeding
speeds of 250 mph. His lightning-fast moves and Energon buzzsaw allow him
to get in and out of many a situation. Mysterious and silent, he reveals
little about himself except a fierce drive to confront the enemy and quickly
return to Cybertron.
