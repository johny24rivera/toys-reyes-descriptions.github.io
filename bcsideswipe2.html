      Like the other Predator
Attack Team Minicon repaints in this year's Botcon set, Divebomb is based
off of the G1 Predacon of the same name. Given that he has a nearly identical
beast mode, it certainly fits, and the primarily orange color scheme certainly
gives him a very G1 Predacon-ish look. The black also serves as a nice
contrast color, though I wish there was considerably more of it, particularly
on his tail feathers. And really, that's my main complaint with Divebomb--
there just isn't enough color variety on him. Except for this teeny tiny
slivers of red painted on his optics, he's molded entirely in orange plastic
and his some black paint apps that are primarily visible in beast mode.
Not a particularly complex scheme-- perhaps some more of that red would
have helped liven things up a bit? It was particularly ingenious to include
Divebomb with Sideswipe, however, since Divebomb's two Minicon ports on
the underside of his beast mode match up EXACTLY with the two Powerlinx
ports on Sideswipe's back end in vehicle mode, essentially giving Sideswipe
a bit of an impromptu "flight mode".

        Divebomb was a daydreamer who would
often come up with brilliant theories as he stared happily at the sky.
When the war came, his only escape from its horrors would be to dream of
a better time, both in the past and future, when destruction would not
be a part of his every day existence. There is a deep sadness inside Divebomb's
Ember that he masks with a cheerful exterior. He understands his importance
in the Decepticon / Autobot conflict and never wants his personal sorrow
to affect anyone else. The only time he will let his true feelings show
are when he is alone, soaring above the world in the sky that he could
once only dream about touching.

          As is usually the case,
Whisper's color scheme is more of a side effect of his larger partner Sideswipe's
colors. The main blue-gray color is a bit boring, but still a serviceable
main color (even if it is way too similar to Wind Sheer's main color),
as is the dull yellow stripes used for his vehicle mode. However... that
is a PUTRID shade of green. Ick, ick ick. It doesn't fit with any of the
other colors at all. Neither does the off-white color used for the head,
though at least it isn't a loud shade like the green is. At least he has
a cool name, though.

             Sideswipe here has a
rather interesting history. This toy, in very similar colors, was originally
going to be released as a store-exclusive for the original
             <a href="tfuniverse.html">
              Universe
             </a>
             line as "Drench", an homage to the obscure G2 character. However, for whatever
reason, it never panned out. Now, "Drench" finally sees a release as a
mirror-verse version of Sideswipe (so named because of the uncanny resemblance
the mold has in robot mode to the
             <a href="g1sideswipe.html">
              G1 character
             </a>
             ).
Also, because of the topsy-turvy world of the mirror-verse and the "slashed"
allegiance symbol on the chest, Sideswipe is a bad guy gone good instead
of a good guy gone bad like Armada Wheeljack-- an interesting twist. As
far as the actual color scheme goes, though... bleh. Like I said with regards
to Whisper, the main color, a bluish-gray, may be dull, but it's still
a decent main color. Not so with that completely ugly, ridiculously loud
coral green, homage to Drench or not. A milky off-white color that becomes
another main color in his robot mode also doesn't help matters much either,
as it's dull and light-colored, neither of which go well with that ugly
green either (and Armada Wheeljack also had a rather similar color in the
same place as that white, as well). On the plus side, though, the head
is nicely detailed, with the head and black looking quite well on the off-white,
and the silver is a nice accent color. So is the yellow, in the lesser
amounts that it's used in.

               Once part of Prime's elite Seeker unit,
Sideswipe was feared as the most ruthless of the trio. Drench, the team's
leader, believed that there should be a balance between a stern hand and
compassion. Though there was a difference in philosophy between the two,
there was also a mutual respect. However, for Optimus, these were not traits
he found appealing in his sub-commander and when the opportunity arose,
he had Drench killed. Sideswipe, though ruthless, was loyal and did not
agree with the fate that had been dealt to his fallen leader. Sensing a
conflict in Sideswipe's "loyalties," Prime let Sideswipe walk into a staged
ambush in which he and a fellow Autobot were left to die. Though the companion,
who had been there by mistake, was killed, Sideswipe survived and ended
up being accepted into the ranks of the Decepticons. While Sideswipe fights
for different reasons than his new comrades, he fights nonetheless. As
a tribute to his former commander, Sideswipe has taken the colors Drench
once bore as a constant reminder to Prime that vengeance is coming.

               Botcon Sideswipe w/ Whisper
and Divebomb easily comprise my least favorite "group" in the 2008 Botcon
set. Divebomb isn't half-bad, even if he could use a bit more color variation,
but Sideswipe and Whisper both just look horrid because of that awful shade
of green. Homage to a cancelled Universe toy or not, their colors just
don't sit well with me. Especially considering how they both share two
major colors with their mass-release versions, I think something else definitely
should have been done with their color schemes.
