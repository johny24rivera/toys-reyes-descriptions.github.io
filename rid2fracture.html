    Fracture's Warrior version
has a pretty decent rendition of his spiky motorcycle alternate mode. As
with the show model, you've got hard angular edges and spikes galore, with
the spikes particularly evident on the back end of this mode. The detailing
of the front wheel cover, the sides of the main body, and the handlebars
are particularly angular. Other than all the angles and spikes, though,
the actual mold detailing is fairly minimal, with some red-painted "RID2015-standard"
trio of divots here and there around the figure, and with a very small
circular windshield, but otherwise it's pretty sparse. The overall proportions
are pretty good, with one notable exception; the lower legs stick out a
bit further down below the main body than they should, making the body
just a bit too bulky. Otherwise, the proportions are good, with no real
robot mode extras visible beyond the upper legs, which are a bit obvious
on the front of the main body-- the fact that they're black, though, helps
to hide them a bit. Overall the color scheme is mostly purple and black,
though in this mode the purple by far is the bigger contributor to the
color scheme. Unfortunately the two main shades of purple are a bit too
similar; one is dark, and the other is on the dark side of medium. Thus
they don't really contrast against each other as much as I'd like. Both
shades of purple have some nice glitter in the plastic, though, so they
both look semi-metallic. Black is the main contrast color, though mostly
in this mode it's only used for the side exhaust pipe. There's some silver
on the top of the rear spikes, and some dull red on the rear spikes to
serve as sort of "headlights", along with some red details on the front
wheel cover, part of the windshield piece, and on the exhaust pipe. The
red contrasts quite well against the black; a bit less so against the purple.
It's still a decent color scheme, but it could be better. (And yes, there
IS a flip-down black kickstand to help keep Fracture stable in this mode.)

    The transformation to
Fracture's robot mode is mostly straightforward-- you fold out the arms
from the sides and the legs from the bottom, but there's an ingenious part
where the front wheel section rotates around the middle of the entire main
body to have the head flip up while the front wheel folds up on the back--
it's pretty cool. That said, the front wheel does stick out a bit compared
to Fracture's otherwise lithe form, and though it doesn't really get in
the way of movement much, it is a minor obvious extra. The wheel halves
on the inside edge of the lower legs also don't look that great-- I wish
there was some way they could have folded back behind the feet, or something.
Other than that this is a remarkably solid mode with GREAT proportions
that absolutely nail Fracture's overall look. The sculpting is all quite
good (though again, fairly sparse beyond all the spikes). The use of the
black for the hands, feet, upper legs and arms, and middle of the chest
helps break up all the purple better in this mode compared to the vehicle
mode. The addition of silver paint on the knees and face-- as well as more
red paint on the abs and chest, eyes, and lower legs help add some more
color variety as well. Fracture's headsculpt is spot-on, with his spiky
mohawk and a stern expression on his face. His weapon is his exhaust pipe
folded out, which makes for a pretty cool, proportionally long blaster.
For articulation, Fracture can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points),
elbows (at two points), inwards a bit at the wrists, and movement at the
hips (at two points), knees, and back-and-forth at the ankles. Given how
well-balanced he is, this means he can get into a lot of nifty poses.

    Although the warrior
class version of Fracture has a couple of minor downsides-- such as his
two shades of purple being too similar and the fairly obvious front wheel
behind his body in robot mode-- overall he's a solid toy in both modes.
His transformation has a nice little surprise flip to keep things interesting,
he's got great proportions and articulation, and a cool weapon and overall
look. Unless him not being able to deploy Mini-Cons is a deal-breaker for
you, I'd recommend this version the most out of his various toys.
