    Vehicle mode is an emergency
SUV. This mode is a bit more "kiddy" than the Max-Con version of
    <a href="arredalert.html">
     Armada
Red Alert
    </a>
    , and there's no big blue hood engine on the latter, but other
than that, it's pretty faithful to the "official" incarnation. The large
red bar on the top of the car is even made of transparent plastic, just
like the larger version. However, Red Alert's robot head is sticking out
VERY blatantly from the front hood. You can turn it around so that the
back is facing the front, like it's pictured above, but this only makes
it slightly less apparent. And although I appreciate the paint detailing
on the windows, Red Alert REALLY needs some on the front bumper- there's
none at all! Only Red Alert's back two wheels in this mode are actually
wheels- the front two are just molded on, and there's smaller wheels under
them that are used for the gimmick. Supposedly, if you push down on Red
Alert's engine/head in this mode and then let it go, he'll zoom in a figure-8
on a flat surface. Thing is, this "figure-8" must be five miles wide, since
it looks like he just moves straight to me. Still a bit cool, though. As
for ports, Red Alert has a Powerlinx port on the right side of the front
hood, but it's far too close to the robot head to be used on 95% of the
Minicons. Gee, that's smart... Red Alert has a Minicon port on the left
door of his vehicle mode as well, and he doesn't look that bad when attached
to a larger Transformer this way. His Autobot symbol is on the left side
of the front hood.

    Robot mode looks like
some kind of freakish robotic pterodactyl. I mean, just look at his arms!
Now only are they far back from his actual body, but they're just engraved
on the car doors! Hence why they look so much like weird wings... His legs
are also short proportionally, which only intensifies this "bird" effect.
Red Alert's chest also sticks out a bit too much, but this is a problem
with the "official" Armada toy as well. He can move at the head, legs,
and arms, in this mode. Decent for a Happy Meal toy, but not spectacular.

    Chibi SUV in vehicle
mode, robotic bird in robot mode. Not the most appetizing of combinations,
in my opinion.
