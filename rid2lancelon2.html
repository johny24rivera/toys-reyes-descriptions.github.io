    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original version of
Lancelon. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
version of Lancelon

     For his single-packed
version, Lancelon's aligned with the Autobots, and hence has a more "heroic"
color scheme. (I do like the idea that the Weaponizers change color depending
upon which side is wielding them.) His main colors are a fairly light blue
along with a pearlescent shade of white-- combined it definitely gives
a "sky" feel to Lancelon, like he should be wielded by a Transformer that
becomes a hawk or something. Lancelon's generally sharp angles help add
to this "feel" of the toy even more. More specifically, the main body of
the toy-- or the lower portion of the lance, depending upon which mode
he's in-- is off-white, while the blade/outer portions are blue. It's a
pretty good color separation, and given the relatively small size of the
figure, there isn't too much of one color in one area, despite the fact
he doesn't have a lot of paint apps. Speaking of those additional paint
apps, he has a fairly light blue "band" across his forehead, with dark
red paint used for his optics, and... some light orange on his waist? Why
is Lancelon wearing early '90s shorts? Well, anyways, I think the orange
looks a bit off, but the painted blue band on the head makes him look a
bit more heroic, somehow, and the red contrasts well with the white. Speaking
of the red, Lancelon's armor bits are red here just like on his original
version, though the red plastic is a bit lighter on this version. It's
a nice contrast color for both the blue and the white, but I kinda wish
the color for the armor bits had been changed just to mix up the colors
a bit more for this redeco.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Lancelon.

     Overall, out of Lancelon's
two different color schemes, I think his more heroic "Autobot" scheme works
a bit better for the mold, with the white and blue going together nicely
with the red armor pieces to make him look like a properly heroic knight,
as opposed to the "darker knight" scheme of his Decepticon colors. I do
wish he had different armor pieces than his original version-- or at least
that they weren't red again-- to shake things up more, but it's still a
good scheme. That said, being part of the rare second wave of single-pack
Mini-Con Weaponizers, this version can be difficult to find outside of
a few countries like Canada, so if you can't find this version for a decent
price just go for the multipack version anyways, this one isn't THAT much
better.
