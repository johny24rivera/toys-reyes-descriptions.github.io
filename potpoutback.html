    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Legend-class
Brawn. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titans Return
Legend-class Brawn

     This one was almost certainly
coming once Brawn got his own mold at the Legends-class scale, and here
we go. Outback is a pretty straightforward repaint, following his G1 scheme
quite closely. He's mostly a light tan plastic, with a fair amount of muddy
brown paint and plastic, with the latter color used mostly on the robot
chest, as well as on the lower legs, lower arms, and front bumper. Black
is also used a fair amount, although it's mostly used for the wheels (and
faux "extra" wheel), as well as for the windows, a small piece on the top
of the front hood, and then on a small stripe on Outback's pelvis. All
in all it makes for a very "desert-y" color scheme, which of course is
perfect for a robot named Outback. Additionally, there's a bit of silver
paint, used on the lower arms (which are molded in muddy brown plastic,
so it pokes through a bit on areas like the fist holes), the head, and
on a small bit of his front bumper. It helps add a little variety to the
color scheme, but not much-- rather, most of the color variety on this
toy comes from spreading out the tan, brown, and black rather effectively
in both modes. There is one foil sticker on Outback, on his stomach-- it
shows four different little mechanical details like a speedometer and some
lights. Kinda odd-looking on a modern toy, but at least it's small.

     One mold change has
been made to Outback, and that's a new headsculpt, which does a very good
job of modernizing his G1 head. It's curved at the sides and forehead,
with a flat top, a forehead vent, and large side-chin guards. His face
is rather "normal", with a visor that's indented for his nose. His entire
head is coated in silver paint, except for the visor, which is painted
a nice metallic dark blue shade. All in all it's a pretty nifty sculpt.

     Power of the Primes
Outback is a pretty spiffy repaint, though he's very by-the-numbers, not
really introducing anything new to the character nor being a particularly
interesting mold himself (though what is here is well-done). That said,
his tan, brown, and black are broken up more effectively than Brawn's colors,
which is why out of the two, I'd recommend Outback more.
