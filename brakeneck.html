    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Minicon Six-Speed. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Cybertron Minicon Six-Speed

     Brake-Neck (nice name
for a race car, by the way) has a fairly basic color scheme of white with
some light gray black "highlights". That, by itself, is a fairly uninteresting
and monochromatic color scheme, but it's the highlights that make Brake-Neck
stand out a bit. The gunmetal gray paint used on parts of his legs and
face goes quite well with the light gray plastic he has, but it's slightly
darker and thus provides a bit better contrast against the white. The dark
blue used for hte cockpit is a pretty attractive shade and again, contrasts
well. There's also a few bits of metallic bronze to give Brake-Neck a bit
more color, and even though they're only used on a few small places (his
headlights and robot eyes, to be specific), it pops quite well against
the white. I do wish Brake-Neck had a bit more of a unique deco job on
the topside of his vehicle mode, which towards the back honestly looks
a little plain even considering the small size of the toy. One last thing--
though Brake-Neck's packaging has him listed as an Autobot, his toy only
has a Minicon symbol on it-- no Autobot allegiance symbol whatsoever.

     Brake-Neck is a decent
enough purchase for Minicon collectors, as it's a decent enough mold with
a nice (though not extraordinary) color scheme. Recommended over the original
Cybertron Six-Speed, but not the "
