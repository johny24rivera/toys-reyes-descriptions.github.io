      Beast mode is an elephant.
This is a very nicely crafted mode, and he has small guns behind his ears
which can act as weapons in beast mode. Unless you look at him from the
bottom, theres no obvious clue this elephants a robot in disguise. The
articulation is also pretty good, as his ears, legs, and tail can all move.
     </font>

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      His robot mode is EXTREMELY
poor and has a lot of extras; in fact, most of his body IS extras!!! The
extras always get in the way, and there is no place to put them. His very
long hands can become claws (only one part of the claws moves, though)
and his feet are short, stubby elephant feet, while his head sticks out
from his neck, making him look like a hunchback. His chest is also hard
to line up right with his head.

        Beast mode is a lion.
His legs are so thin they look like hes starved that part of his body
and none of the other parts. His hind quarters also look rather odd, as
they become his weapon in robot mode. Other than that, hes kind of nice
looking, with a large mane(sometimes the two halves dont always stick
together) and a fierce face with nice detailing.
       </font>
       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Robot mode is okay.
His back lion legs fold out from his robot legs, so his robot feet look
awkward. His front lion legs fold back from his robot arms, but they dont
get in the way. His lion tail becomes a large claw weapon, and his mane
fold out to look like hang glider wings. His chest part also comes apart
sometimes, as there's a lot stuffed in there. Transformation is extremely
hard, and only recommended for experienced transformers.

           Beast mode is a bald
eagle. One of the best beast modes in the original Beast Wars Transformers
line, with no obvious clue hes a robot except for his robot hands under
his tail feathers. His wingspan is impressive, about four times his body
width. The detailing in this mode is also superb too.

          <br/>
          <font face="OCR A Extended">
           Robot mode is very nice,
but there is one big problem; his large wings in the back can make it hard
for him to stand up. You can fold them forward to become missle launchers,
but then it looks like he's wrapping himself up in his wings, which looks
odd. He has two extremely large white jagged swords, making him look like
a slice-and-dice kind of guy. The eagle head pops out over his robot head.
I'm not sure what to think about this, since it complements the robot mode
just as much as it subtracts from it. His feet also look a bit odd, since
they are his eagle feet turned backwards.

             Robot mode(the only one
he has) is a combination of Silverbolt(the eagle), Ironhide, and Prowl,
all sold together. He looks like a robot version of Conan the Barbarian
with lots of hair on his face. He has some extras on his arms and legs,
but these dont get in the way as much as they do on Ironhide, even though
they do look odd. He has a large sword, composed of all three of his component
transformers' weapons, and he has two missile launchers on his chest from
Silverbolt. The articulation in this mode is excellent, the only major
part of his body not being able to move is his head.

way to the head of the Maximal battle lines, with three times the fighting
force! Prowl's ferocity, Silverbolt's swiftness, and Ironhide's strength
team up to form Magnaboss - a triple power threat capable of annihilating
any Predacon enemy, even the ultra combative Tripredacus! Magnaboss owns
the battlefield, arming itself with a massive, megaton battle sword composed
of Silverbolt's razor tipped wing swords and Ironhide's blunt force battle
clubs mounted on Prowl's cyber tail claw. If two heads are better than
one, Magnaboss is way ahead of that game...times three!
