    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Jetfire. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Jetfire

     Cybertron Sky Shadow
is definitely worthy of the name, as his paint job SCREAMS evil Decepticon.
The dull maroon, greenish gold, and charcoal gray go together incredibly
well, and that's even without considering the awesome paint apps Sky Shadow
has all over his vehicle mode. The crooked, uneven stripes on the top of
his wings and cockpit look especially cool, like some kind of arcane markings.
The gold, fuchsia, silver, and yellow accents also fit very well with their
surrounding colors, so no complaints there, either. (Though a red or orange,
rather than a yellow, visor would probably have worked a little better
on the robot head.) Given his overall scheme and the placement of the major
colors, it would would appear that Sky Shadow is a homage to G1 Blitzwing,
a triple changer who could become a plane and a tank. Granted, Blitzwing
didn't have paint apps nearly this awesome, but the similar scheme is easy
enough to recognize.

     No major mold changes
have been made to Cybertron Sky Shadow, but the molded-in Autobot symbol
on Jetfire has been removed and replaced with a painted-on Decepticon emblem.

     Cybertron Sky Shadow
is a thoroughly awesome repaint of Jetfire-- it's hard to see this mold
getting any better than this, though the mold itself is, sadly, pretty
mediocre overall.

       An often-overlooked observer who prefers
to remain in the background, silent and unnoticed. Few who know Sky Shadow
fully appreciate how dangerous he is. Even among his Decepticon fellows,
Sky Shadow doesnÂ’t quite fit in. While most other Decepticons prefer to
bully, boast and plot against one another, he waits, watching, collecting
information and laying his plans until he is certain of victory over his
enemies. For in reality he is the Autobot second-in-command Jetfire! Tired
of his passive role as commander of the Autobot earth forces, he has gone
underground and taken on a new identity in an attempt to bring down the
Decepticons from inside.
