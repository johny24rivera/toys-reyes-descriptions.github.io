    Vehicle mode is a tank.
This mode is very nice- but, as you may have noticed, it's not really show-accurate
in its color scheme. On the show, Armorhide has a tan desert camo, whereas
this one has a sky blue camo. A little bit less common of a camo, and I
don't know why in the world Hasbro did it, but hey, it looks cool. Even
though Armorhide only has three major colors, they all work very well together
and make him look like he has a more varied color scheme than he does.
Armorhide does not have actual rubber treads in this mode (the size of
the treads and his transformation make this impossible), but rather small
plastic wheels on the underside of them. Regrettably, there's not really
much to do with Armorhide in this mode- only his wheels and his tank turret
move- but that's to be expected for a realistic vehicle mode. You can add
his guns on the back part of the tank to give him mucho firepower, though.
&gt;:) The Decepticon logo on the front of the tank is oddly off-center- it's
entirely on the left side, which makes that part look badly asymmetrical.
But it's not that big of a deal.

    Armorhide's robot mode
is very... blocky-looking, I'll give it that. Although the camo still looks
rather nicely in this mode, that's really all that's good about this mode.
His head is too small proportionally, and his chest sticks out way too
much for my liking. Also, Armorhide has no freakin' HANDS- his "arms" are
just the front halves of his tank mode with little pegs on the top to hold
his gun. Bah. Speaking of his guns, he can't store his larger gun in this
mode, and, as you hopefully know by now, there's not much more I hate than
having to get a seperate plastic baggie to keep Transformer's non-storable
weapons in. Armorhide's legs are also oddly proportioned, although they're
still better than, say,
    <a href="rollbar.html">
     Rollbar's
    </a>
    . The feet
are still much larger and longer than the legs, but at least the feet can
be passed off a thicker part of the legs, since there's no real "feet"
to speak of, just blocks. Armorhide's tank turret extra also rather sticks
out a bit in this mode, and looks rather odd from a side view. At least
it doesn't get in the way of movement. Not that there's much movement available
in this mode, anyway- Armorhide's arms can move at the shoulders, and his
legs can move at each knee, but that's it. (The legs, however, cannot move
independently, and the knees don't lock into any position except straight
down.)

    Armorhide has nice color
scheme, but the age of this mold shows through on this toy. His articulation
and playability are extremely limited when compared to other toys released
in the RiD toyline. Still, he's my favorite of the Decepticon basic combiners.
