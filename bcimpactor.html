not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Rook. For

      a
GOOD toy
     </a>
     of Impactor! A mobile assault vehicle fits this hard-edged
Wrecker perfectly, and unlike his FoC version, this one actually has the
correct colors, with FunPub not afraid to make an Autobot mostly purple.
(It's a really eye-catching shade of purple, too). The main contrast color
is an orangish yellow that you'd often find on a Bumblebee toy, and it
does its job well. Mostly visible in robot mode, there's also a bit of
white on the upper legs, neck piece, and the middle of the arms, and is
another excellent contrast color. The only plastic color I'm not fond of
on Impactor is that darned blah light milky gray, which isn't a MAJOR color,
mind you, but is used on the combiner peg, the back of the feet, and the
shoulders. I really wish a darker or flatter shade of the color had been
used to make it look more like metal. There's an impressive amount of silver
paint on Impactor, including the wheel hubs, much of the front grill, parts
of the chest, and tons of little details on the side of the vehicle mode/arms.
Really the arms the most impressively-painted part of the toy, with even
the little "hatchet and tool" details on the lower arm pieces completely
detailed, with black surrounding said "hatchet and tool" details as well.
It all looks quite nice. To finish things off, there's a bit of dark red
used for the headlights and the knees, and it complements against the yellow
fairly well and makes Impactor at least a little more "Autobot-y" in his
colors. One interesting little bit done to the toy to make Impactor more
"Impactor-y" with one hand (despite the fact that the mold has two hands
molded into it) is that only the left fist is painted, while the right
is left unpainted-- you're meant to plug in there the little gray claw-like
weapon that comes with the toy, and it actually works pretty well as Impactor's
tool-arm despite not being molded for that purpose. Well done, FunPub.

     Impactor has a new headsculpt,
which for the MOST part is pretty solid-- it definitely looks a lot like
the comic character, with a purple "mohawk" and nice black details on his
forehead and around his eyes. His face is silver, though the lips molded
onto his face look a little puffy. Other than that, though, it looks good.
No other mold changes have been made to the toy when compared with Rook,
though added with him in the box are redecos of "Thrilling 30th" Arcee's
weapons, with milky white swords, a little gray gun, and a purple/yellow
gun. The swords can fit into the holes in his fists, albeit kinda loosely,
but cannot be stored in vehicle mode, which is always one of my pet peeves.
The guns are a nice addition, but he can't hold them-- you have to put
them in his 5mm ports instead.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Impactor is a highly
recommended buy if you're in the market for Club exclusives, even if you
don't plan on combining him. It's an utterly fantastic mold in both modes
with a great color scheme, tons of paint apps, extra weapons, a reasonably
good headsculpt, and a nice creative way to give the character his trademark
"tool-hand". If you ARE planning on combining him, well, all the better.

       During the Cybertronian Wars, the tales
and legends surrounding the infamous Wrecker leader, Impactor, rivaled
that of any other robot involved in the conflict. Operation: Volcano, The
Trials by Flame, the Garrus-9 Incursion, these stories and countless others
were once told in hushed tones in the darker corners of Maccadam's Old
Oil House, or among nervous troops awaiting their next assault.

       Impactor can transform into an armored
tactical assault vehicle, capable of a modest 25 hics per breem. In robot
mode, he carries a double-barreled concussion cannon, but Impactor prefers
a more personal approach. He has recently "borrowed" an assortment of new
hand attachments including: a Linear Beam Emitter, a surgical-grade Spark
Extractor, and he has recently become fond of dual superheated laser swords
capable of slicing an enemy in two with a single slash.

       The only thing more terrifying than
facing Impactor in battle is his vengeance. Although still rational enough
to form battle plans, Impactor's thirst for revenge robs him of any modicum
of mercy he once had. Especially when he is avenging lost teammates and
friends.
