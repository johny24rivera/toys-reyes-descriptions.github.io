    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original TLK Tiny Turbo
Changer Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original TLK TTT Bumblebee toy

     "Knight Strike" Bumblebee
doesn't do anything particularly unique for movie 'Bee redecoes; it just
mostly reverses the colors, with black now being the domninant color and
yellow being more of an accent color. As such, the majority of this toy
is black plastic, which can muddle some of the more intricate mold detailing
in robot mode. He's particularly dull in vehicle mode, given he's only
got two small yellow stripes on his hood and that's it for paint. He makes
up for this in robot mode, with almost his entire chest and helmet painted
yellow, while his face and abs are silver, with blue eyes on his disturbingly
cute visage. That said, most of this paint just sort of "gives" Bumblebee
what he already had-- yellow on his chest and head. Overall, Hasbro could've
pulled off a better Stealth redeco with better paint app placement-- I'd
recommend the original slightly over this one, despite generally liking
black over yellow.
