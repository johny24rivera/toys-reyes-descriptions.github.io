    Scourge's alternate mode
is a highly futuristic spacecraft that kinda looks like a doorstop, truth
be told. This mode looks pretty nice-- the only way robot extras are visible
is if you look at the toy from the bottom or, to a lesser extent, the back
end. Everything fits together very nicely, and there's plenty of paint
apps to help break up all the light blue-gray. (Though why they used such
a light shade instead of a more show-accurate medium blue is beyond me.)
The gold looks espcially good against the dark blue. There isn't a whole
lot of mold detailing in this mode, however, though part of that can be
chalked up to the "sleek" look they were going for. The only real noticeable
beef I have with this mode-- which is inherent in the design-- is that
you can't really DO anything whatsoever with it-- no wheels/landing gear,
no guns that can rotate, nothing. It's basically just a sleek block of
diecast metal and plastic.

    Scourge's robot mode
is the very essence of a shell former-- almost his entire alternate mode
forms his wings, with the only parts really being shared between modes
are the top of his head and his lower legs. Still, Scourge pulls it off
rather nicely-- the wings look fairly bat-ish, and very fitting for an
evil character. The lower legs are a bit too large compared to the upper
legs, however, and the arms and shoulders could stand to stand to be a
bit bulkier. The head is also just a tad too big, though the face sculpt
is very good, with part of the beard being painted a nice shade of silver.
He could also really use a good weapon in this mode, too. The mold and
paint detailing on his body are also pretty good, certainly much better
than the rather sparse mold detailing in his alternate mode. Scourge has
pretty good articulation, as well-- he can move at the shoulders (at two
places), elbows, wrists, hips (at two places), and knees (at two places).
Scourge doesn't have a whole lot of diecast for a Titanium toy-- his lower
legs and main body are diecast, but that's it.

    Scourge is a fairly
good Titanium, with a nice vehicle mode (even if it doesn't have a whole
lot of playability), and a pretty good robot mode, as well, though it does
suffer from a few minor proportions problems. He pulls off the whole "shellformer"
thing very nicely-- mildly recommended.

      After the catastrophic battle in which
both Megatron and Optimus Prime were mortally damaged, the fleeing Decepticon
forces dumped the ruined bodies of their former comrades into space to
lighten their load. In the void of deep space, the wreckage drifted until
an ancient creature known as Unicron swallowed it up, melted it down, and
used it to create a hose of mechanical servants. Among this host was a
squad of elite tracker-terminators known as the Sweeps, led by the deadly
and silent Scourge.

      Screaming down out of the night sky
of Cybertron, Scourge and his troops fell upon Autobot and Decepticon alike,
destroying all those who stood against them. They were the first in a long
line of heralds and servants to the evil Unicron, and to this day many
of the streets and buildings of Cybertron carry the scars left by their
powerful disintegration cannons.
