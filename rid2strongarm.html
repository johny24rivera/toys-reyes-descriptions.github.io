    Strongarm's vehicle mode
of a police SUV is pretty well-done at this scale (though then again, THIS
mode is usually done pretty well on nearly ALL of her toys). The proportions
are pretty much exactly accurate to the TV show, and there's no robot mode
extras at all. She's also rather large in this mode compared to other RID2015
Warrior toys, which helps keep her more in scale (she's not actually bigger
in mass-- much of her underside is hollow in this mode-- and she becomes
more "normal-sized" in robot mode). She has the usual white-and-dark-blue
color scheme, though her blue is a glittery mix of the color, so it looks
nice as a semi-metallic shade. The mold detailing is fairly sparse, as
is usual for a RID2015 toy, though there are a few "divots" near the back
end (which become her lower legs in robot mode) and a fairly well-detailed
front grill and rear bumper. Unfortunately, although she has a decent color
breakup, she definitely needed considerably more paint apps, or at least
a more show-accurate plastic breakup. Her front grill is completely barren
except for some moderately light blue on the headlights (which does look
good against the white, by the way), the red and blue on the sirens is
there, there's some white on the top of the rear section (which, again,
becomes her lower legs), some black on the front and side windows (but
sadly not the back) and a bit of blue paint on the side doors and around
the front wheel rims. Her back bumper is barren, as are the wheel rims.
Her lines on the sides SHOULD have secondary smaller lines above the thicker
lines, and of course the front grill and taillights need to be painted.
She's also missing the proper blue line down the front of her hood, as
opposed to the odd blue "block" that is the back portion of the front part
of her hood. Strongarm's gun is stored out-of-the-way underneath this mode,
though there is a port in between her sirens if you want her to wield some
firepower as a police SUV.

    Strongarm's transformation
is one of the more involved out of the Warrior class, though it's still
not at all what I would consider difficult-- just
    <i>
     relatively
    </i>
    involved
compared to the usual "slightly simpler than your usual deluxe" Warrior
transformations. Basically the back end becomes her legs, the front sides
and front grill become her shoulders and lower arms, her middle section
forms a backpack, and her middle section is formed from interior parts
unseen in vehicle mode. The end result is fairly show-accurate, though
her arms are a little on the awkward side-- the shoulders are a bit flat
in one direction and too broad/long in the other, and her lower arms have
folded-up panels around them, which isn't a huge deal but is a minor downside.
She also has a pretty substantial backpack made of her vehicle roof and
side doors. It does stay against her back pretty solidly, but the doors
to stick out from the back quite a fair bit and can interfere with shoulder
movement some-- she's better looked at from a more frontal view. Her legs
are pretty spot-on perfect, with just the right details, and her waist
has some nice detailiing to make it look like she has a "belt" on. The
mold detailing for her chest and head is pretty accurate, with the chest
looking like some vehicle mode plates folded together and the expression
on her face pretty accurate, but both lack enough paint apps. The blue
apps on her chest should have the secondary lines 'n such that I talked
about from vehicle mode, and her head-- though it has nice light blue eyes,
a silver face, and a pale yellow head crest-- needs some white along the
sides, too. Still, those issues aside the toy does the job of replicating
her rather bulky-for-a-female physique. For articulation, she can move
at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), waist
rotation, and movement at the hips, knees (at two points), and slightly
back-and-forth at the ankles, making her pretty poseable. (That said, there
are limits-- the shoulders, due to their odd proportions mentioned earlier,
can't move as much as you'd think, and there's an odd pivot piece for the
shoulders along the sides of the body that never locks into place and is
a minor pain when trying to pose that part of her.)

    RID2015 warrior Strongarm
is the best representation of the show model in plastic in a "normal size"
when it comes to both modes, though she does suffer from some minor kibble
problems in robot mode, particularly around the shoulders and the overly-large
door flaps on her back. She also could've used some extra paint, especially
in vehicle mode-- this is one of the rare RID2015 toys where I actually
bought the Japanese version too, since that one is painted sooo much better.
Still, if you're not in the market for that version, this one will do in
a pinch.
