       I don't even know if
I'd call this version of Prowl a repaint, really. It's just so obviously
overstock with a few new paint apps. These new paint apps are good for
the most part, don't get me wrong- the red dots on the bottom of the doors
and on the fins break up the monotony of the vehicle mode a little, and
the dragon deco on the doors looks pretty darn cool, too. I'm not sure
what the number "105" is doing on his hood, though- maybe it stands for
how many times this mold has been repainted, who knows. :pÂ  The HUGE
Autobot symbol on the hood looks ridiculous, though. Prowl might has well
have spray-painted on him "SHOOT HERE". As for the rest of Prowl, it's
EXACTLY the same as the original version of RiD Prowl. It's just such a
lazy repaint, it's really more of a variant.

       Universe Prowl isn't
bad, per se- he's just a crummy and extremely lazy repaint. I'd recommend

           Side Burn fares slightly
better than Universe Prowl with his paint scheme, but it's still a very
lazy repaint. What Hasbro basically did was coat Side Burn's alternate
mode in black paint, but gray dots on it to simulate a "snake skin" hood,
and slap another honkin' huge Autobot symbol on his roof. What's extremely
odd about his alternate mode, though- and even more proof that the guy
who came up with this scheme just didn't care- is that the front and rear
bumpers are still red, compltely clashing with the black since there's
no reason for these fragmented spots of a different color. His robot mode,
ignoring the car bits, looks the same as his "Powered-up" RiD redeco.

           Universe Side Burn just
looks so half-way done that it's not even funny. Especially since the rather
coarse black paint has a tendency to come off, many people have reported.
(Although none on mine has.) He looks different enough in the package,
but don't be fooled- he's still an extremely lazy repaint, and not worth
picking up, even for the Universe CD.
