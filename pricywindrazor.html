    "Windrazor" is an homage
to the G1 Terrorcon Cutthroat, with his name probably changed to keep it
from being too violent-sounding, I suppose. Regardless, Windrazor's dragon
mode is rather reminiscient of a pterodactyl with a larger body and longer
legs. In dragon mode, his proportions are generally good, with the only
offense here being that his shoulders seem a bit too wide (though obviously
we're talking about a mythical creature here). The wings can fold out at
one point, and when both of Windrazor's wings are splayed he has quite
an impressive wingspan for a Legion class toy. His legs and long feet keep
him quite steady as well. This said, there is one major issue I have with
this mode, and this is how obvious his robot hands are next to his wings;
combined with how his shoulders are positioned and move, it's just almost
impossible to make this section of the dragon mode not look oddly posed.
The sculpting is quite good; he's got ornamental armor-like detailing all
across his form, as is typical of the Prime Predacons. The wings also have
a rather "skeletal" look to them, and the head has a rather gnarled beak,
giving Windrazor a more fearsome, monster-esque appearance. Windrazor's
color scheme is ripped right off of G1 Cutthroat, with a rather nice, creamy
yellowish tan shade that not only contrasts extremely well with his dark
green body and the dark violet paint on his wings, but also makes for a
pretty original color scheme as well. His beast eyes are also painted bright
red, bringing out that detailing well against the milky plastic on the
face. The only color I'm not fond of is the yellow on the talons, beak,
and headcrest-- it's so close to the yellowish tan it blends in really
easily, to the point where you wonder why exactly Hasbro used money on
these paint apps. For articulation in this mode, Windrazor can move up-and-down
at the neck, up-and-down at the base of the tail, the aforementioned "spreading"
point on his wings, and at ball joints at the shoulders, elbows, and hips,
so he's decently articulated for a Legion toy. Windrazor comes with the
bow-weapon that is packed in with many Beast Hunters legion toys, and his
is a rather nice shade of dark bluish gray.

    Windrazor's transformation
is incredibly basic, involving folding his shoulders and legs down, his
tail up, and then flipping his head. That's it, which means that his robot
mode looks quite similar to his dragon mode, with the arms being the arms,
the legs being the legs, and the main body still being the main body. I
don't mind simple transformations, but having a TF with modes this similar
removes a lot of the "magic" of the transformation process, in my opinion.
On the plus side, Windrazor keeps his excellent proportions in this mode,
as well as his nice color layout and detailing. The top of the beast head
makes for a nice chest, and his robot mode headsculpt looks oddly "normal"
for a Predacon in terms of Transformer faces, with a rather miffed look
to his humanoid face. (His face is also painted yellow, which is again
hardly noticeable; his eyes are still a bright red, though, which looks
great.) I do wish his feet looked a bit less odd, what with the heels being
larger than the front toes. I also personally would've liked his wings
to have been on his back in this mode to make for a better silhouette and
to differentiate the modes a bit more. For articulation, Windrazor keeps
the same appendage movement in this mode, but loses his tail and dragon
neck movement due to their position and the transformation.

    Prime Windrazor is a
decent enough update to the G1 Terrorcon Cutthroat, and in that respect
it succeeds; it also has nice articulation and proportions, particularly
for a Legion-class toy. However, his two modes are just way too similar
to me, and his wing-arms are situated oddly in his beast mode; it's because
of these issues that this is my second-least-favorite Legion Predacon mold.
