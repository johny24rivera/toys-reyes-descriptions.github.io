    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF voyager
The Fallen. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     In a bit of an homage
to his original
     <a href="thefallen.html">
      War Within form
     </a>
     , The Fallen
has been done up in fiery colors. The two main colors by far are a fiery
orange and a "burnt charcoal" gray, both of which work very well together
to give him a "fire elemental" look, which certainly fits how he looked
in his original War Within incarnation. The thing is, those two colors
make up practically all of his colors. There's a few minor silver and light
red paint apps, as well as his light red "solar panels" that fold out,
but they're all small exceptions to the rule. Personally although I love
the fiery scheme, I would've preferred a tad more variety-- perhaps some
more red and some yellow. The paint apps are also generally the same as
on the original voyager class The Fallen, and I think they missed a huge
opportunity here to paint his appendages up with "flame" paint apps, which
just would've looked awesome.

     No mold changes have
been made to the "Burning" Fallen.

     I really liked how fiery
the original Fallen was, and I was kinda disappointed they didn't really
go that route with the movie version of the character. This nice redeco
helps to rectify that, and although I'd recommend it above the original,
I think it doesn't quite live up to its potential to really look fiery
in terms of its paint apps and lack of real variety of plastic colors.

       For millennia, he has waited. Thousands
of years have dragged by as he recruited proxies, one by one, to scour
the cosmos for the artifact he required. Now he finds he must return to
the primitive, flesh-slug infected planet on which his quest began. Nothing
will stand in his way this time. If need be, he will scour the surface
of this disgusting world clean in the fire of his rage, and search through
the blasted rubble for that which he seeks.
