    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Dirge.

     in the boxset, Thundercracker doesn't resemble his "traditional" G1 self
much, instead being based on the Machine Wars mold which shares pretty
much no relation to what most fans think of as Thundercracker besides being
a Decepticon jet. Given that the original Machine Wars Skywarp and Thundercracker
both shared the same mold, it's only fitting that their Botcon exclusive
versions share the same mold, as well. FunPub kept more to the "template"
set by the original MW Thundercracker toy this time, though, with Thundercracker
retaining the reddish brown camo on his jet mode that the original had.
That said, with this being a larger mold and an exclusive, the camo is
considerably more realistic and extensive than on the original MW toy,
with the camo patterns looking really well-done and detailed. The white
outline around the camo really helps add some additional contrast to the
paint apps, and the dull pea green-- even if it SOUNDS kinda gross-- certainly
works for the alt mode. There's some additional reddish brown paint apps
on the launchers and tailfins, along with a Decepticon symbol in front
of a triangle back there and on the sides of the nosecone. There's also
the traditional military "white star on a blue circle" logos on his wings.
All in all, it's a pretty fitting color scheme for a military jet. In robot
mode, unfortunately, a lot of the camoflauge is relegated to only being
visible from the back, which makes Thundercracker look a fair bit less
interesting. That said, an increased amount of rusty reddish brown on his
robot parts does help to mix things up some. This is actually not accurate
to his original MW toy, which had some greenish black plastic in place
of much of this brown. I much prefer this new color scheme, which keeps
the same "feel" as the MW toy but looks more interesting color-wise. Thundercracker
also has silver along his visor, his chest, the "rim" of his missile launchers,
and his cockpit. He's also got a black head, to give him a bit more color.

     Just like with Skywarp,
Thundercracker has the same new headsculpt, and obviously since they were
redecos of each other, it looks perfect on Thundercracker too. No issues
here.

     Botcon 2013 Thundercracker
is one of the weakest toys out of the full set, but that is almost entirely
due to the weak base mold. His color scheme is quite good, fitting for
a military jet and with some good contrast between the dull green and rusty
brown, along with a good deal of awesome camo paint apps in his jet mode,
though I wish he had just a bit more paint in robot mode. Recommended over
FunPub's update of MW Skywarp, at any rate.

       Thundercracker is loyal to the cause
of unifying the Cybertronian Empire, however he does not believe in Jhiaxus'
means of doing such. He remains rebellious within the ranks of the new
Decepticons and does not fear displaying his contemptuousness to his superiors.

       Often times Thundercracker prefers taking
his clone squadron on monotonous patrols and performing menial tasks so
as to distance himself from his fellow Decepticons. This also allows him
to practice his latest tactics for striking fear in his enemies while acting
on his disdain for anything incapable of flight, without feeling judgment
by the piercing optics of the land bound Soundwave.
