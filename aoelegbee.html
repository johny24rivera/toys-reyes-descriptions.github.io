    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Guess what? It's Bumblebee!
In a very Bumblebee-like color scheme! If you're expecting this exclusive
redeco to have a vastly different color scheme from most other movie 'Bee
toys, well... keep looking. That said, beyond the usual "yellow and black"
color scheme-- and the inaccurate robot mode design and still-inaccurate-but-less-so
vehicle mode design-- there's a few minor things different for this redeco.
The yellow is a bit lighter than it is on most Bumblebees-- it's still
a little dull, but the "orange" part of the usual orangish-yellow has been
removed from the equation for this release; I think the purer yellow looks
quite good, as it contrasts against the black better (it actually looks
more yellow in person than in these pics, which tint it to more his usual
orangish-yellow. Huh). And speaking of the black, Bumblebee has more black
paint apps on this version than on most of his other Legion-class toys;
beyond the obvious big stripe down the middle of the vehicle mode with
little stripes around it, there's also nifty stripes down the sides of
the vehicle mode, angling up and over the rear tires, and his front grill
and headlights are black too. There's also a black Autobot symbol on the
right side, and in robot mode some black paint around the middle section
of his lower legs. Particularly in vehicle mode, this added deco looks
nice. The light blue windows are really what make this redeco stand out,
though, as they contrast nicely enough against the yellow but REALLY well
against the black, and just give the whole scheme a "brighter" feel (but
not in an obnoxious way). Bumblebee's face in robot mode is also painted
a rather inaccurate-- but still cool-- off-white. It makes it look like
his face is a skull, which I like, as it gives him just a bit of unintended
creepiness. (Now I really want a "ghost Bumblebee" redeco...) The only
important details that don't have paint on this version are the taillights.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee.

     If you have any previous
version of this mold (or the superior
     <a href="dotmcybumblebee.html">
      Dark
of the Moon legion-class Bumblebee
     </a>
     ) that's colored like "normal" Bumblebee,
there isn't much to recommend here, given how similar this release is to
most other releases of 'Bee. That said, if you don't have one, this is
one of the best-looking "normal" paint jobs this mold has had, with the
added black paint apps, light blue windows, and a "yellower" plastic all
making Bumblebee look better than he usually does.
