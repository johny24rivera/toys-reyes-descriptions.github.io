    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Hound. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Hound

     Rollbar, a straight repaint
of the Hound remold
     <a href="altswindle.html">
      Swindle
     </a>
     , is the first
Alternator not to be based on the obscure G1 toy it's named after. G1 Rollbar
WAS a Jeep, but he was dark green-- given Hound's color scheme, it's obvious
why this scheme wasn't used for Alternator Rollbar. (Of course, Trailbreaker
would've been a MUCH better choice for the third use of this mold, given
the head, but that's neither here nor there.) Rollbar's new color scheme
is orange, black, and light bronze-- not a bad color scheme per se', though
I've never seen an orange jeep before. The black does go really well with
the Halloween orange, though, and the bronze and grayish brown makes for
a gray tertiary color, and helps differentiate the mold from Swindle at
least a little. Using a main color scheme that was bit more different from
Swindle's yellow-and-black, however, would have definitely been appreciated
on a straight Alternator repaint. I also wish the head had been differentiated
a bit more as well, considering it looks exactly like Swindle's, just with
a different-colored visor. One of the cool little extra things done to
Rollbar is that his license plate, with the standard "ROLLBAR" on it, isn't
just a white square with an Autobot symbol this time around-- it's a Colorado
license plate replica! Very cool, and adds even more realism to the toy.

     Alternator Rollbar,
given he looks nothing like G1 Rollbar, is one of the more odd choices
for the Alternator line, and the repaint isn't really any better than Swindle,
either-- they're both about as good color-wise as the other, in my opinion.
Rollbar's main colors should also have been a bit more different than Swindles,
as well. If you're looking for one version of this mold, I'd still recommend
Hound over this guy or Swindle.
