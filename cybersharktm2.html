    Beast mode is a robotic
shark. This beast mode is not as deformed as the other Transmetals II and
looks very cool. It is nicely detailed, with small hydraulic pumps and
wires sticking out EVERYWHERE. The teeth are sharp, though, so be careful.
The bottom side flaps don't stay on very well, and end up flipping back
and forth whenever you move the toy. Its robot legs, which forms its lower
jaw in beast mode, don't stay on very well either, and flip down unless
you rest his underside on something else. You also can't move many parts
in this beast mode, and his missles inside his mouth can come out easily.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The bonus vehicle mode
is kind of poor. The only thing you do is flip out his bottom side flaps
and turn them sideways and flip part of his tail out to reveal a spinning
"motor." It doesn't really even resemble a vehicle.

    The transformation from
beast to robot mode is not so much hard as it is frustrating. Several parts
may snap off during transformation, and they are hard to get back on. Transforming
from robot to beast is even harder, as you have to line up all of the parts
a certain way to get the transformation to work properly.

    Robot mode is very nice-looking,
but has a fair amount of extras that can come off somewhat easily. These
include his flaps with fins on them, his fins, and his shoulder armor.
One of his arms is normal, and can hold either his missle launcher or one
of his fins like a sword, and the other is a turning slicer. His face doesn't
look much like the original

and looks more like a teenage Transformer's.

      Cybershark hunts his enemies at over
600 knots. From there, little room is left for escape. Armor-piercing,
jaw-mounted sonar tracer torpedoes have water-to-air capabilities. Spin-drive
tail boosts speed and acts as quad-bladed razor weapon in attack and robot
modes. Also deploys thruster jets for higher speed and limited low-level
flight. A fierce warrior, Cybershark honed his skills while bounty hunting
a rogue band of Cybertronian space pirates. Fully dedicated to the Maximal
cause, he often follows his own methods to the frustration of his commander,
Depth Charge. Calculating and fearless, he gives the Predacons a good reason
to stay out of the water.
