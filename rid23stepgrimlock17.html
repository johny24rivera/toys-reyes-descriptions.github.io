    Grimlock's t-rex alt
mode for this new "updated" 3-step version is... rather odd looking. There's
definitely some proportional issues, here. For one, His tail is too short
coming off the back-- it's about 1/2-2/3rds of the length it needs to be,
and just doesn't look right at all. The head looks slightly off as well,
with the nose being a bit too flat and the head a bit too large in proportion
to the nose. The biggest offender, though, has got to be the body. For
one, there's too big "spikes" coming off the back that certainly don't
fit in with the overall silhouette and aren't part of his design at all--
they're only there for the simple transformation, but those are pretty
big things to overlook. The t-rex is a bit oddly flat and angular, and
below his "chest flap" there's absolutely no body in there, with the robot
fists blatantly visible near the back of where his lower body should be.
It just looks bad. The feet are a bit better, but a bit too large proportionally
and a bit too obviously his robot feet backwards-- they aren't situated
like robot legs. There's also obvious clips above the hips, which look
rather odd. For a color scheme, he's your usual black-and-green, though
the green is a bit more milky and glittery than usual. His arms are painted
silver-- COMPLETELY silver, which is a bit inaccurate-- and his upper jaw
is painted silver as well, along with some pale gold on his headcrest and
some fairly light blue on his eyes. There's some other black and green
paint used here and there to keep things varied up, though using the accent
colors a bit more would've been appreciated. Unfortunately, all Grimlock
can move in this mode are his legs back-and-forth at the hips; he has no
jaw or arm articulation, so he's pretty brick-ish for a t-rex. There is
a port on the lower back for a Mini-Con Weaponizer or something with a
similarly-sized port, but on his lower back? It's an odd place to put a
weapon.

    To get him to robot
mode, you basically flip his lower body around on its pivot to clip together
for the waist and the lower legs, while his body also flips around in one
motion and turns itself essentially inside out to form the upper body.
This is definitely Grimlock's better of the two modes, as his bulky-but-muscular
proportions are much closer to his show model in this mode, with large,
stocky arms and legs, and a wide chest. His stomach is a bit too wide,
but otherwise his core proportions are pretty decent, though there are
some kibble issues. His t-rex arms are obvious on the sides of his body--
one of the reasons why his midsection looks a bit too fat. Behind his back
you can see the core portions of the t-rex mode that his whole body swivels
around-- some curvy black parts at the top, some hollow green parts on
the lower body, and the biggest offender-- the dino tail poking out obviously
upside down behind his legs. The new paint apps in this mode include some
of that pale metallic gold on his rather angry-looking face, complete with
blue eyes; some orangish-yellow on the center of his shoulders; and some
green paint on the bottom of his chest and around the yellow circles on
his shoulders. Again, it does a pretty good job of breaking up his various
colors, but a bit more of those accent colors like silver or yellow would've
helped even more. For articulation in this mode Grimlock can move forward
a bit at the elbows, but that's it. (Unfortunately, due to the transformation
his legs can't move forward without undoing the waist clip.)

    The robot proportions
for the 2017 version of 3-step Grimlock are a little better than the
    <a href="rid23stepgrimlock.html">
     original
3-step
    </a>
    , the paint apps/color scheme are comparable, and the tail is
attached in both modes this time. However, in every other aspect this is
inferior to the first version. The articulation is more limited even more
for a 3-step changer, there's some kibble issues in both issues, and worst
of all, the dino mode just looks off and bad, with no real "meat" to the
body and some bad proportional issues. Unless you absolutely must have
the tail attached, I'd get the original 3-step toy over this. I'd say it's
one of the weakest 3-step molds there is.
