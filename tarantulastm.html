    Beast mode is a metallized
tarantula. A very nice mode, with cool legs, and a large, well-crafted
back, with the only weird part being his legs in front of his mouth, which
sort of look like feelers. The only extra in this mode is the chainsaw-blade
under his feelers, which get in the way of feeler movement a LOT.

    Vehicle mode is his
spider mode with two wheels stuck out from under it to make it look like
a motorcycle. This mode doesnt stay balanced, and its front wheel comes
off easily, but this mode is still great if youre careful.

    Robot mode is very evil-looking.
It has his spider legs as an extra on his back, but these dont get in
the way much and actually complement the mode, making him look all the
more evil. The wheel-shoulder pads jiggle a little, however, and can get
in the way of some arm movement.He has little neon green eyes everywhere,
and his feet are transmetal gold, shaped into sort of claw-feet. His chainsaw-blade
makes a great weapon- perfect for dissecting transformers, hehehe....

    A very nice transformer,
and looks exactly like the TV show bersion, except that his eyes are two
normal ones on the figure and one long bar in the TV show.

      There are few Predacons spinning webs
of violence and deceit as skillfully as the eight-legged ninja warrior
Tarantulas. After the quantum surge, Tarantulas was delighted to discover
himself as a meched-out arachnid with motorcross vehicle-like capabilities.
Instead of constantly relying on stealth and surprise, Tarantulas now races
into battle on his wicked new wheels, converting into a new animalized
robot mode that makes him virtually unstoppable in battle!
