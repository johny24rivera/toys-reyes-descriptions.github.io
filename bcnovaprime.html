not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the "Thrilling 30th" Generations

     Nova Prime was an imperialist/expansionist
Prime from IDW's "ancient history" of Transformers, and has come back in
the comics now and then. He's never had an official toy made, so this is
Fun Pub's attempt, using the Orion Pax mold. Taken by itself, this is a
fairly good color scheme-- white and black are definitely the main colors,
but there's a fair amount of transparent blue (on the windows and axe)
and gold paint apps here and there to vary up things from being a monochrome
scheme. The best part of this paint job-- and the one that hearkens the
most to Nova Prime's form in the IDW comics-- are the black-and-gold "feathers"
behind the body of the truck/on the lower robot arms, as they look remarkably
like IDW Nova's bird wings. The blue plastic also goes great with either
the white or the black, and is a nice "in-between" color for the toy. The
various gold paint apps- used in small amounts on the feathers, robot toes,
robot waist, and a few other areas-- also work pretty nicely. As far as
more minor, accent colors, there's some silver on the wheel hubs and inside
the transparent chest (which looks quite good, with a nice blue paint in
the center of the silver "engine bits" surrounding an Autobot symbol).
There's also a titch of yellow on the lower arms and headlights that doesn't
contrast against the white enough, but on the other hand there's a really
nice shade of dark metallic blue on the front grill and robot waist that
I wish was used more on the toy. All in all though, given that he's the
same mold as the "freebie" exclusive for the year
     <a href="bclioconvoy.html">
      Lio
Convoy
     </a>
     and has a fairly similar color scheme, one can't help but see
a bit too much of the former in Nova Prime. To be fair Fun Pub DOES do
a fair bit of paint app differentation, with considerably more black on
Nova Prime and the colors "varied up" from one toy compared to the other,
and Nova Prime does have a pretty decent number of paint apps. But there
just needed to be more feathers, given how big of a deal that was with
Nova Prime's IDW aesthetic-- just a few bits on the back of the truck doesn't
really cut it.

     Nova Prime has the same
headsculpt as Lio Convoy, but painted to fit him better, with a black faceplate
and antennae, yellow on his forehead vent, and some nice blue eyes. It
works mighty well as Nova Prime's head, though like Lio Convoy, the side
antennae are a bit too small because of space restrictions for the head
in alt mode. Otherwise, no complaints.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nova Prime is a nice
try from Fun Pub, but ultimately falls short of his fellow exclusive Lio
Convoy-- who is also the
     <i>
      "freebie"
     </i>
     membership exclusive-- from the
same year. The paint apps are nice, the color scheme isn't bad, and the
mold is excellent, but without some big add-on to give the toy wings, it
just doesn't feel enough like Nova Prime. I realize that this was likely
beyond FunPub's capability to do, but in my opinion that means they shouldn't
have bothered. It only works as a sort of "Nova before he was Prime" downgrade
version, so I'd only recommend spending the exclusive $$ to get this guy
if you particularly want that specific version of the character.

       Nova Prime walks a fine line between
being hte leader his heritage demands and battling inner demons that threaten
to tear his synaptic conscious to a psychotic breaking point. While his
"accolades" will be remembered in the Halls of Iacon for eons, he is looking
for redemption for what he sees as a "lapse in vision" for his fellow Cybertronians.

       Combining his Quantum Fusion cannon
and his "G-Metal" Battle Axe, Nova Prime is a formidable warrior on the
battlefield and a masterful tactician in the war room. Nova Prime has been
given a second chance and seeks to usher in a new Golden Age of Cybertron.
Will a new lasting peace on Cybertron finally come to fruition or will
the whispers of the past come back to haunt Nova Prime, taking away any
chance at redemption and plunging Cybertron once again into... Chaos?
