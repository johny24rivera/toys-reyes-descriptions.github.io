     Hey, it's Classics Trypt-
I mean, Shattered Glass Grimlock! Yes, it appears that in "Mirror-verse",
Grimlock= Trypticon. I think beyond them both being T-Rexes, the connection
is tenuous at best, but anyway. This mold actually works surprisingly well
in Trypticon colors-- the gray is noticeably darker than on Classics Grimlock,
and the purple, green, and particularly the orange go very well with it.
(I wish the gray was even darker, though, both to differentiate him more
from Classics Grimlock and to provide more contrast.) The green looks noticeably
brighter in most pics than it actually is, which I was heartened to see--
it really works well as an accent color. The silver is a decent color,
but unlike the others it doesn't contrast with the gray much. The black
is also nice, but it's in the exact same places on this toy that it was
on on Classics Grimlock, which I think was a rather poor decision.

     Botcon Grimlock has
a pretty cool color scheme, taken by himself-- however, given how Trypticon-y
his colors are and how similar his major colors are to his Classics self,
I feel a bit more original of a scheme could've been used for a concept
like a Mirror Universe.

       Grimlock is a tragic figure. He was
originally developed by the Decepticons as a soldier whose sentience would
be based on artificial intelligence rather than a Ember. However, his violent
subroutines overrode his logic programming causing him to destroy the facility
that created him. Megatron was able to deactivate him and he was stored
away, never to be used again. However, when Optimus Prime learned of this
creation, he stole Grimlock and reactivated him. Offered a chance to revel
in his violent tendencies, Grimlock eagerly joined Optimus Prime and serves
as his most potent warrior. Grimlock will not stop tearing through the
enemy ranks until they are all destroyed or he can no longer move. He simply
cannot feel mercy and has little self control. "I wish I had a thousand
more like him!" says Autobot leader Optimus Prime. Fortunately for the
Decepticons, he doesn't.
