    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Tow-Line. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Tow-Line

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Ratchet's new body is
a remold of a toy that was made for his character, Energon Tow-Line. Besides
just sporting a new color scheme, the mold also has a brand new head, the
same one that Ratchet's Botcon buddy
     <a href="bcironhide.html">
      Ironhide
     </a>
     has. It's quite a well-molded head, and with more silver paint detailing
on it than Ironhide's had, which brings out more of its features. In addition
to that, Ratchet also features one more remolding that Ironhide doesn't--
a brand-new Energon weapon! As opposed to the metal detector-like gun that
Ironhide and Tow-Line have, Ratchet has a gun that becomes an emergency
siren in vehicle mode! It doesn't quite mesh with the surrounding parts
when it's attached in vehicle mode, but this toy obviously wasn't made
with that idea in mind in the first place, so I can forgive a little thing
like that. What is bad about the gun, though, is that it really doesn't
look much like a gun when used in robot mode-- it doesn't really have any
barrel, just sirens on the front of it-- it looks too much like Ratchet's
just holding his sirens in his hand! So I think I like the original gun
this mold had better. Another downside to Ratchet is that his color scheme
is really, really dull. He has far too much white on him, with black being
the closest thing he has to a secondary color-- and a white-and-black color
scheme isn't particularly eye-catching. He's got some paint apps, but the
red apps and the blue transparent plastic are all that really give Ratchet
much of a contrast, and those colors are only concentrated in a few areas.
Another, more eye-catching color really should have been made a secondary
color on this toy.

     Of note is that in addition
to being a Botcon 2005 exclusive, you could only buy Ratchet for $65 with
Flareup at the convention-- it was not available free to preregistrants
or available at all to those who did not attend the convention. Ratchet
is limited to 500 pieces, so he's worth a pretty penny.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon Ratchet has some
nice remolding done to him, but his color scheme is one of the dullest
I've seen on a Transformer, and his gun looks rather odd. It's a nice gesture
to make the Tow-Line mold into a fan-favorite G1 character, but more variety
should really have been added to the toy to make him a good toy on his
OWN, and not just as a G1 character. One of my least favorite of the Botcon
2005 toys.

       It would have been easy for a veteran
such as Autobot Ratchet to become embittered after ages of war, death and
destruction. However, even after several million years, this Autobot has
retained his original cheerful disposition and tendency to look for a good
time. This is not a reflection of irresponsibility. Rather, Autobot Ratchet
knows that while he tends to the injuries of his patient's bodies, he must
also help heal the wounds in their Sparks. Being the best tool-and-die
man on Cybertron, no other Autobot is more qualified for the job.

       Abilities: For half a century following
the last Great War, Autobot Ratchet traveled the galaxy to train in various
forms of combat to better save disabled comrades on the battlefield. As
a result, he is now one of the most adept Autobots in hand-to-hand combat,
although he prefers not to use it unless absolutely necessary. Ratchet's
wrists contain a variety of welders, laser scalpels and liquid dispensers.
His primary weapon is an Energon-blade that can also emit stun-blasts.
Autobot Ratchet is able to combine with his repair bay trailer for greater
mobility on the battlefield.
