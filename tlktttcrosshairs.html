    Crosshairs' Corvette
Stingray alt mode is replicated kinda sorta here, in a bit of a super-deformed
style, of course. The dimensions are a bit wider compared to the length
of the actual Stingray, the roof doesn't raise up as much, and the wheels
are definitely larger. However, some of the telltale details are here,
like the rather unique sleek front grill and headlights, as well as the
angular taillights. There's also some vents on the sides near the rear,
well-detailed wheels, and some basic details like the car doors. From the
back end you can rather easily see the top of Crosshairs' head, but otherwise
this mode is kibble-free. The plastic is a somewhat dark milky green--
a bit darker than on most toys of Crosshairs, but it's not TOO off, and
it works well with this small of a design-- especially with the limited
paint, having a light green shade of this plastic wouldn't have looked
as good. The wheels are painted a glossy black, and same with the side
windows-- unfortunately the back window isn't painted, and the front window
really can't be due to the transformation. I do wish they had gotten in
at least some basic version of Crosshairs' unique black deco on the sides
of the car mode, or something on the headlights/front grill. There's a
bit TOO much unbroken, undetailed dark green plastic here. (And no, the
wheels can't roll. It's a Tiny Turbo Changer folks, you get what you pay
for.)

    Crosshairs' transformation
is incredibly simple-- just fold up/back the front section of the car,
stand him on the revealed feet, and then wedge his arms apart slightly,
which are made up of the rear two-thirds of the sides of the car mode.
That's it. Unlike other Tiny Turbo Changers that use this transformation
scheme, this actually fits Crosshairs quite well, making the front car
piece hanging off his lower back look like a simplified version of his
"trench coat". Yeah, there's chunks of the car mode on the sides of his
arms, and a bit off the back end of his head, but really, at this scale
these compromises are more than acceptable. His proportions fit in with
the usual Tiny Turbo Changer "super-deformed" look, with a much larger-than-usual
head and smaller legs than you would expect. The detailing on Crosshairs
is exquisite for such a small toy-- all of the necessary details are here,
from the angles on his shoulders to the faux car front with some black
angles on the chest, to the diagonal-looking kneecaps, to the two-toed
feet. The head also has his "goggles" molded on his forehead, with a similar
"helmet" flat on the sides and a characteristic sneer/look of disgust on
his mouth. Only the face and the chest are painted silver, with some light
blue on the eyes; otherwise he's all green in this mode. Again, I would've
liked another paint app or two, but this IS a $3-4 toy, after all. For
articulation in this mode, Crosshairs can move back-and-forth at the shoulders,
but the articulation points are actually closer to the midpoints of his
arms than his shoulders, making it look a bit off if you move the arms
too far up.

    Tiny Turbo Changer Crosshairs
is a fun little toy for its cheap pricepoint, with a simple transformation
as befits the size class, a nice dark green base plastic color, not much
kibble in either mode especially given his design, and some great mold
detailing in robot mode. Of course I wish he had some more paint-- particularly
in vehicle mode-- and his transformation won't exactly blow your mind,
but it gets the job done. A slightly above-average toy for the size.
