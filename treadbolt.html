      This time around, Rollbar
sports a color scheme that is definitely a homage to G1 Hound-- this is
especially apparent in vehicle mode. Not only is he pretty much the same
color- a dark forest green that they use on many military vehicles- but
he also has that white star on the hood. The dark navy blue goes very well
with the green, and the brown gives Rollbar even more of a "military" feel
than he already has, which is great. The silver paint apps also look great
all around, as they almost always do.

      Rollbar is a really
nice repaint of the Armada version of him, and a great homage to G1 Hound.
Although I think the actual mold is rather uninventive, he's certainly
rather nice to look at.

        Treadbolt's color scheme
is... pretty bad. The cheese yellow and pale blue-green clash quite a bit,
and simply don't go together in the least. The charcoal blue-black is also
just an ugly color, and wouldn't look good on any Transformer. It would
have been better if it was just plain black. His face in robot mode also
looks positively comical in the way it's painted- something that I'm sure
wasn't intended, which bothers me. Simply but, Treadbolt looks like Wario
in robot mode. He's got the mustache, the yellow colors, the mean look
in his eyes... y'know, the works. All he would need is overalls and a cap.
On the plus side, he's not a straight pallet switch- many of his paint
apps are different than on his predecessor Scavenger. This shows that at
least some thought went into Treadbolt. The dark blue on his arms also
looks pretty cool, especially with the "worn" look given to them by the
light blue wash paint app.

        Treadbolt is a bad repaint
of an already bad $20 mold. As such, I can't recommend him to anyone who
isn't a completist. Bleh.
