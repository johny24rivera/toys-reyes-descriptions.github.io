    Vehicle mode is an Indy
race car. This mode is rather... plain-looking. It doesn't really catch
the eye at all. The silver paint in the middle and the fuchsia Autobot
symbol are the only things that stand out. The rest is just a rather boring
amalgamation of white and purple. On the upside, though, this mode has
absolutely no extras to speak of, and is pretty solid.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    During Skid-Z's "flip-changer"
transformation, it's important to note that the lever which initiates his
transformation (the race-car back fin) "sticks" a bit to the rest of the
car, and, given that the long part of the lever is very thin, it almost
seems like it's going to snap when you're changing him from vehicle to
robot mode. Be careful during this part!

    Skid-Z's robot mode
is a bit better in the color scheme department. The shiny teal really adds
a lot towards making this figure look better. However, there's one problem
I have with this mode, and it's a huge one (literally); Skid-Z's race-car-front
chest is waaaay too long and large. It makes it look like he's all just
a chest with arms and legs- he has no visible waist or anything to speak
of. The wheels on the bottom sides of his legs also look rather awkward
as well. At least his articulation's decent- his head can move, as well
as his shoulders, elbows, knees, and upper legs. However, the upper leg
movement is inhibited a bit by his very large chest. Skid-Z also has a
pretty cool gun- it's stored in two halves inside his legs, so you can
take one piece out to form a "short" gun, or both out to form a "long"
gun. Pretty nifty. The "light piping" effect used or his eyes works very
well, too.
   </font>

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Although he has his
good points, such as articulation and his nifty weapon, Skid-Z is, overall,
a rather dissapointing figure. If it's not his boring color scheme in vehicle
mode, than it's his awkward chest in robot mode. There's a good chance
you can find a better Transformer out there.

      Skid-Z is an excellent scout, using
his high-speed capability to get into and out of enemy territory before
anyone even knows heÂ’s there. And in the rare event that he is spotted,
his zero-start acceleration power and creative moves soon leave the bad
guys in the dust. He loves speed competitions - watching them but especially
racing in them!
