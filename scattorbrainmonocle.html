       Scattorbrain's color
scheme definitely blends in with what his bio describes as his home-- the
Moon. Two shades of gray make up about 70-80% of the color scheme on Scattorbrain,
but that's not to say he's dull-- the light green plastic parts add some
nice contrast to the gray while not being used enough to look gaudy. The
silver paint apps and the metallic light blue used for the windows also
help to add a bit more contrast and make Scattorbrain look fairly cool
overall, and appropriate for a Decepticon-allied Transformer on the Moon.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       No mold changes have
been made to Scattorbrain, though he does have a new silver Decepticon
faction symbol painted ON TOP OF his molded-in Minicon symbol, which I
think was a pretty bad placement choice...

         There are legends on the Moon among
human colonists of ghost vehicles - autos and aircraft without drivers
- that sometimes charge in from the barren, lunar desert to destroy a settlement
or a vital terraforming project. The vicious ghosts then disappear into
the depths of the lunar night, leaving few survivors. Scattorbrain for
his part relishes his status as a legend, and plays up the ghost angle
at every opportunity, appearing for a few moments on the horizon near a
human outpost, and then disappearing before he can be identified; occasionally
attacking smaller outposts to wreak a little havoc and keep the rumors
going.

           Monocle has a cool name,
but NOT a cool color scheme. Yellow and light gray, with a few bits of
black, is hardly an eye-catching color scheme, and the particular shade
of yellow used is a bit garish as well. On top of this, the number of paint
apps on Monocle has been very noticeably reduced when compared to Drill
Bit-- the only paint apps he has that aren't on his windows are two patches
on his feet and a rather sloppy black paint apps across his optics. (I
guess the latter is to make it look like he only has one optic, so he fits
the name "Monocle".) The complete lack of paint apps on his arms and legs
make him look almost prototypish. The comparatively large Autobot symbol
added to the front of his chest/cockpit window also looks rather goofy,
too.

           No mold changes have
been made to Monocle. The left foot on mine is at a slight angle when compared
to the right, but I haven't heard of this being a widespread problem.

             Monocle could be considered one of the
mysterioius ghost vehicles, but for a different reason. He and his companions
on the Exploration Team stayed on the Moon after most of the other Mini-Con
robots left because they wanted solitude and quiet contemplation. They
spend most of their time on the dark side of the Moon, where few humans
go, and are occasionally spotted by explorers driving across the empty
landscape, or meditating on the floor of an old crater. Their peace is
distrubed only by the disruptive aggression of Scattorbrain and the other
members of the Lunar Assault Team.

though, has a pretty bad color scheme with very few paint apps-- I'd definitely
recommend him the least out of the mold's three paint jobs. Overall, you're
probably better off getting the
