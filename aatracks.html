    Turbo Tracks is a pretty
direct update of the
    <a href="g1tracks.html">
     G1 Tracks toy
    </a>
    , with his
alternate mode still a dark blue sports car, but a bit more "modernized".
The proportions are great in vehicle mode, with no robot mode extras in
sight. (Technically you can see his waist and upper legs through his windshield,
but the plastic is tinted so dark you really have to squint to see them
in this mode. Given that they're so dark, this is also one of the few instances
where the painted-black windows don't obviously clash with the transparent
windows.) The paint detailing is also quite well-done, with all the necessary
details-- the headlights, taillights, grill, windows, and wheel hubs--
painted. The flames on Tracks' hood also look pretty darned awesome, taking
his traditional gold &amp; red flame colors and making them a bit more
"tribal" in their styling. It still contrasts very well against the dark
blue and catches the eye, as well. Being a Reveal the Shield toy, Tracks
has a traditional rub sign on the center of his roof, which can be rubbed
to reveal that he's--gasp!--an Autobot. Of one additional note is that
this toy is capable of forming the "flying car" sub-mode just like the
G1 toy, done by pretty much just rotating the doors out and folding out
the little "wings" on them. It's admittedly rather lame, and it exposes
a little of his inner robot mode, but given it doesn't really affect the
toy otherwise, it's a nice little fan nod.

    In robot mode,
Tracks takes very close cues from his G1 form again, with mostly only the
proportions and detailing being updated to more modern standards. He also
has a rather cool "automorph" part of his transformation, where when you
push up on his hood/chest his shoulders and arms automatically move outward
while his head shoots up and his chest gets wider. However, he does have
a sizable backpack in this mode made from the rear third or so of the car.
It says out of the way of
    <i>
     most
    </i>
    articulation, but it's still definitely
worth pointing out. Otherwise, the other bits integrate into his robot
mode pretty well-- the roof becomes his chest, and the front of the car
mode stays behind his legs and forms part of his heels. The wing-doors
and wheels make his silouhette around his shoulders a bit beefier and better-looking,
to boot. His proportions are generally pretty good, except for the arms--
they're way too short and skinny size-wise, and are this mold's only really
glaring flaws. (It's also made a little worse by the fact that Tracks is
a tad barrel-chested.) The mold detailing is a bit more sparse than on
most toys these days, but giving that this is a Classics-styled update
of a G1 sportscar, it mostly fits his sleek design. On parts like the legs,
robot head, and arms, the details are done quite well. The two "side missile"
pieces from the vehicle mode are on the same detachable C-clips that many
other toys recently released have, and are meant to be attached to the
backpack behind Tracks' head-- though you can attach any other C-clip weapon
to those two spots back there, as well as Tracks' handheld weapon, which
has a C-clip attachment too. The color scheme is pretty spot-on G1, which
certainly isn't bad-- blue, black, and white work quite well as a color
scheme together, with some of the red and gold highlights making some good
accent paint apps. That said, I feel that although the metallic gunmetal
gray on his lower legs looks nice, the light gray and "regular" gray plastic
are fairly dull and don't really add anything to the color scheme. As for
articulation, Tracks has plenty of it-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, waist, hips, knees (at
two points), and ankles (at three points). His backpack and wings do interfere
a bit with shoulder movement, however. His two shoulder-mounted weapons
can also move up and down at an additional point besides just the C-clip
attachment.

    Turbo Tracks is generally
a very nice and fitting upgrade to his G1 design, with great articulation
and generally good proportions. His stubby little arms are a definite detractor,
and his backpack in robot mode is a bit on the bulky side as well, but
these aren't nearly bad enough by themselves to ruin the toy. If you're
at all a fan of the G1 character, this is an easily recommended pickup.

      If there's one thing Autobot Tracks
loves, it's himself. In his opinion, nothing is quite so fine as the glint
of sunlight off his perfectly polished chrome, or the looks humans give
his sweet paint job as he rolls by. He's no coward, but he avoids battle
all the same, if only to protect his precious body from getting scuffed
or, even worse, dented.
