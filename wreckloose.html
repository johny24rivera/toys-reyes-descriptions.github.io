    Wreckloose's (HORRIBLE
pun, ugh) beast mode is a lizard. This mode is very well done, with great
proportions and even better detailing-- there's mold detailing EVERYWHERE
on this guy, from the small spikes on his tail to the techno-organic "piping"
on his underside. He's also got some pretty good paint detailing too--
I especially love the gold lines under his eyes and the silver "metal patches"
spread throughout his structure, it makes him look like he's been through
a good deal of battles. He also looks like he has little orange "straps"
going across his tail to hold his scarred structure together! He also has
very good articulation for a beast mode; he can move at the shoulders and
knees of each of his four legs, and his front two legs also have a little
ankle articulation. His mouth can open and close, and what's especially
unusual is that his mid section can swivel back and forth in not one, but
TWO places, so you can get a pretty good number of poses out of him. I've
heard some complaint about Wreckloose's color scheme, calling it "clashy",
but I don't see it-- all his colors seem to meld pretty well to me, and
are appropriately "lizardy" in their overall mix. There are a few downsides
to this mode, though most of them are somewhat minor-- first, his robot
hands are rather obvious, sticking out from the back of his front legs
like they are. Second, due to his construction, it's rather obvious that
his tail splits in half and rotates at the waist to become his robot legs,
though this doesn't really count as an "extra". Third, the way that his
Decepticon symbol sits on one side of his forehead instead of in the middle
of it looks a little odd, I don't understand why Hasbro put the symbol
there of all places. And fourth, his Cyber Key gimmick looks a bit odd
in this mode-- if you insert the key into the slot of the armor piece on
his upper back, little spiky antlers swing out to the sides. A lizard with
antlers? Still, if you don't like it, you can always take the armor piece
off and put it aside-- it makes the mode look more streamlined with it
off, I think.

    Wreckloose's robot mode
isn't quite as good as his beast mode, but the significant word there is
"quite"-- it's still rather good. Just like in his beast mode, Wreckloose
has got great articulation-- with the exception of being able to do the
splits or bend sideways at the knees, Wreckloose can be put into pretty
much any other position you could reasonably expect on a smaller-than-Ultra
toy. When it comes to interesting detailing, Wreckloose also still excels
in this mode-- the cobra-snake-like design on his chest is especially eye-catching.
The straps molded on his legs in this mode look like they could be used
for holding guns-- which is why I think instead of just having the rear
beast legs hanging off the right leg in such an ugly manner, it would've
been better if they could have somehow slided to the side to the leg to
look more like a gun holster. The way his transformation is done, his legs
are also two different colors, which is a little distracting at first,
but you quickly get used to it. Another slight downside is that the lizard-head
halves about his shoulders have the hollow part more visible in this mode,
which doesn't look all that great. Some have said that Wreckloose's head
design is ugly, and this is true, with its large horn on the forehead and
orc-like maw, but it's obviously meant to be ugly-- Wreckloose is a mean
guy and proud of it! The Cyber Key weapon can be held on the back of either
of his arms in this mode as a shield-weapon, or if you don't want him to
be holding it (as it does get in the way of movement a bit), you can simply
plug it onto his back for storage-- a very thoughtful and appreciated feature!

    Wreckloose is a very
unique and interesting Transformer, with some GREAT articulation, detailing,
and an innovative Transformation. His odd robot legs and his weak Cyber
Key gimmick are his major downsides, but if you can ignore these few things,
he is a very fun figure and one of the better Cybertron beasts. Recommended.

      An eager fighter for Scourge, Wreckloose
throws himself wholeheartedly into battle. He rarely carries a ranged weapon,
preferring to use his bladed shield in close combat. Able to blend in almost
perfectly with the Jungle Planet underbrush and move silently through even
the densest vegetation, he will wait in hiding for days just to ambush
a challenging opponent.
