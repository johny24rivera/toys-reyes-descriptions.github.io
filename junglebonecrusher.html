    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie deluxe
Bonecrusher toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie deluxe Bonecrusher toy

     Jungle Bonecrusher is
certainly jungle-themed, that's for sure. The dark green and light green
colors are particularly close representations of foilage colors, and the
tan parts on him look a bit like dirt while still hearkening back to his
original colors. That said, the sudden change in colors from the dark green
to the tan does, admittedly, make it look like Bonecrusher is wearing a
green sweater, as has often been said in the Transfandom. Using light green
on the legs would have helped to alleviate this a bit, I think. The color
accents on Jungle Bonecrusher are great, particularly the silver-- it REALLY
fits nicely against the dark green on his chest. Jungle Bonecrusher's prerequisite
electric "Allspark Power" blue also fits in well with the overall color
scheme, again particularly well with the green (but not so much with the
tan). In vehicle mode, Jungle Bonecrusher is entirely dark green-- I'm
not sure if this is particularly realistic for a minesweeper vehicle, but
I think it looks nice regardless, and the vehicle mode being almost entirely
one color at least attempts to make the color scheme look more realistic.
Oh, and he still has his famous "dog with huge teeth" Bonecrusher insignia
visible in vehicle mode. Hooray!

     Jungle Bonecrusher is
a great repaint, giving completely new, complimentary colors to Bonecrusher
while still retaining the essence of the character's colors in robot mode.
That said, his color scheme isn't quite as realistic (though more exciting-looking)
than the original Bonecrusher toy's, and having dark green arms but tan
legs makes it look like he's wearing a green sweater. A bit less of the
tan would have made him look slightly better, I think. Recommended slightly
over the original Bonecrusher, if only because the color scheme is a bit
more varied.

       Barely functional after his battle with
Optimus Prime, Bonecrusher crawled away from the scene of his defeat and
hid. Effecting what few repairs he could on his own, he also removed his
locator beacon and communications hardware, cutting himself off entirely
from the other surviving Decepticons. Fleeing south, farther and farther,
he eventually found himself deep in the jungles of South America. Hidden
in the most remote area on Earth, he is free to indulge his rage on the
rainforest without interruption.
