    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior Megatronus
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RID2015 warrior
Megatronus toy

     Warrior class Bludgeon
is the
     <a href="rid2battleprime.html">
      2nd toy
     </a>
     in the RID2015 line to
have that name, though it's definitely the one where the name most fits,
as this is a bit of an update to the G1 Pretender shell, which was a warrior
skeleton samurai shell that had a TF inside that transformed into a tank.
Now, he's a samurai warrior with a skull-face that transforms into a tank--
no shell required. He's a partial redeco of
     <a href="blastwave.html">
      Blastwave
     </a>
     ,
who himself was a very blatant "pre-tool" of Megatronus for Bludgeon. I
say "partial redeco" because several plastic colors actually stay the same
(and in the same places) between them both. Bludgeon has the same shade
of dull military green on the shoulders, inner body, and on the sword and
small connector pieces that Blastwave has (though the wheels under the
treads are black this time now, for some reason). Silver paint is also
used in all the same places as on Blastwave, as is the light gray plastic
used on places like the upper legs and arms. The charcoal black plastic
&amp; paint is in all the same spots, too. The paint masks are the same,
as well; that is, even if the colors are different, paint covers the same
spots in the same manner on Bludgeon as on Blastwave. Honestly, this kinda
bugs me a bit-- I would've appreciated a bit more difference between the
two warrior figures, especially since Bludgeon never appeared on the show
so Hasbro could let their imagination run a bit wild. The blue on Blastwave
has been replaced with light orange on Bludgeon, and it contrasts against
the military green much better and really helps emphasize the "Halloween-y"
aspect of this scary Decepticon. The yellow on Blastwave-- that is, on
the "eyes" on the skull-like details on both modes and on small stripes
on the dual cannons-- is purple on Bludgeon, which fits better as a Decepticon-y
color. Purple is also used on Bludgeon's robot eyes. Red is used on Bludgeon,
but more than on Blastwave. Bludgeon still has the same "stripe" red paint
apps on his shoulders, but his red is lighter, and is also used on much
of the lower arms, as well as painted on his helmet. (His skull face is
still white.)

     Bludgeon shares all
the same base mold changes made to Megatronus that Blastwave does, but
has no unique mold changes of his own.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     If you don't have Blastwave,
Bludgeon is a pretty decent, unique toy that updates the character while
still fitting within the RID2015 aesthetic, even if the vehicle mode is
kinda weak. If you DO have Blastwave, though, then unless you're just a
big Bludgeon fan, this is probably a pass, as so much is the same between
them. It feels more like a low-effort store exclusive redeco as opposed
to a mainline repaint. Oh, and if you like the Cyberverse version of the
character, you may also want to get this toy as well, since it's 95% the
same design and much more articulated and proportional than the Cyberverse
toy.
