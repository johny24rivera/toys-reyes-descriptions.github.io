    Finally, the RID2015
version of Optimus Prime gets a 1-step version that ISN'T an

    </a>
    ! As for the vehicle mode, I doubt I really need to introduce
you to Optimus' alt mode at this point. In comparison to most other RID2015
Optimus Prime toys the proportions have a few oddities, but it's
    <i>
     largely
    </i>
    on-par. Most of these little oddities are from the transformation sequence--
for example, the trailer kinda angles downwards to the bottom at the beginning,
due to the fact that it has to fold up against the main body of the figure
during the transformation. There's also an odd "spoiler" protrusion at
the back end, which is the result of having to peg together against the
cab during the transformation as well. The robot feet stick out somewhat
obviously out the back end, but compared to some 1-step changers like
    <a href="rid21stepquillfire.html">
     Quillfire
    </a>
    it's not that big of a deal. On the back end you can also see the back
of the head, but it doesn't stick out, you can just see it down in there.
Both the red and dark blue-- at least the plastic shades of the color--
are milky shades, which help add a little more visual interest to the toy
in terms of these particular colors. There's some black used for the tires,
of course, and some metallic charcoal black on the front stripe of the
windows on the cab (though unfortunately not on the sides). There's also
some red paint on the sides of the trailer, but it's a noticeably duller,
darker shade of the color that doesn't really "fit" with the red plastic
very well. The mold detailing, as per the usual RID2015 toy, is fairly
sparse in most places like the trailer, with a few angular details (and
the usual trio of divots near the center of the trailer), but there's a
few intricate areas. The wheels have some surprisingly intricate detailing
like bolts in the center of each, and there's angular stylized truck doors,
smokestacks, headlights, and the like along the front cab section, though
it's not painted either. There are a few rear bumper tail-light details
on the back end as well, which I appreciate, even if they aren't painted,
as rarely do simplified toys like this even bother with bumper details
on the back end.

    This version of Optimus
has a transformation that's basically the same as 1-step changer

    --
you take the front section (the cab) and rotate it up and back, and the
trailer "opens up" into the robot mode. The end result is pretty decent,
although it certainly has its downsides. On the plus side, from a frontal
view Optimus Prime looks fairly proportional, and all of the mold details
are pretty good, fron the abs and chest details to the angular details
(complete with the RID2015-usual trio of divots) on the arms to the couple
of details on the long legs. The headsculpt is also spot-on, with some
silver on the faceplate and light metallic blue on the eyes. There's also
some dull red on the shoulders, silver on the middle part of the arms and
the abs, and black on the feet and the chest. Finally there's some light
milky brown plastic on the upper legs and a few minor connector bits, which
is frankly an ugly color but at least isn't used much. The lower arms and
lower legs really could use some paint to break up all that dark blue,
but overall the colors are good. The cab section does poke up quite obviously
from behind the head, though, as it pegs in with that odd spoiler during
the transformation. I wish it was located lower along the back so it didn't
stick up as much; that's a downside with this mode, for sure. The arms
are also VERY 2-D-- they can move forward at the shoulders (the only articulation
on this toy), and when they do you can see just how flat and odd-looking
they are from any angle that isn't directly frontal. They also move not
straight forward, but slightly inwards too, just because that's how the
joints are situated, unfortunately. When you move the arms forward, there's
a bit of the sides of the trailer "left behind" sticking out of the hips
too, which is also an eyesore.

    The 2016 1-step changer
version of RID2015 Optimus Prime is the best mass-release 1-step version
of this design. It's got a pretty solid vehicle mode and the robot mode
is okay too, though it's definitely the weaker of the two modes. The big
cab sticking out behind the head and the very flat, odd arms are kinda
weird. But for a 1-step changer, it's still definitely above-average and
better than the 2017 mold, so if you're looking for a toy like this for
a kiddo, here you go.
