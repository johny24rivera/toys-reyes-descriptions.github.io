    Like the other "Reveal
the Shield" Legends figures, Prowl takes heavy cues from his
    <a href="g1prowl.html">
     G1
toy
    </a>
    in his design. In vehicle mode he's a police car very much in line
with his G1 toy, but a bit more streamlined and sportscar-esque. The proportions
are GENERALLY good in this mode, but the fromt bumper looks a bit too wide
and fat. Prowl also doesn't have any back bumper-- you can clearly see
his knees back there-- but other than that, this mode has no robot mode
extras. The mold detailing is a little on the sparse side to keep Prowl
a bit more toon-accurate, though thankfully there's enough paint detailing
to keep him from looking too boring in his rather monochrome getup-- his
windows and headlights are painted that metallic silvery blue shade, his
siren a light red, and he's got a black front bumper and very G1-like "HIGHWAY
PATROL POLICE" decals on his car doors. I wish his side rims were also
painted black like the G1 toy, but that's getting a little nitpicky for
such a small size. Since he's a "Reveal the Shield" toy, Prowl has a small
allegiance rub symbol near the front of this mode-- rub it with your thumb
to reveal he's an Autobot.

    Prowl's transformation
and robot mode design are identical to
    <a href="uni2jazz.html">
     Universe
2.0 Legends Jazz'
    </a>
    toy, so many of the same critiques and complements
I have about that older toy apply here. Prowl's arms a bit weak-- they're
very flat and two-dimensional, with the doors hanging rather unceremoniously
off the sides-- but other than that, he looks pretty good in this mode
(given the size class). His robot face has a nice sculpt to fit the character
and is painted well, with his distinguishing features like his red head
crest all there. His chest area is a bit wide, but that's a bit easy to
overlook given the size and Prowl's original G1 transformation. The side
windows hang off his back like wings, and help add a bit more to the silouhette
of this mode instead of detracting from it. His legs are top-notch, having
no proportional problems whatsoever and good stability with the feet. That
said, I do wish his upper legs were painted gray or black to mix up the
colors a little more. For a Legends class toy, his articulation is above-average--
he can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and ankles.

Prowl is definitely one of the better molds for the size class, that's
for sure. He's got a few minor proportional problems in vehicle and robot
mode, but for the size that's practically to be expected. It remains quite
faithful to the G1 toy while updating things a little bit for today. If
you're into Legends class toys and/or like Prowl, this is an easy recommendation--
mildly recommended otherwise.
