    Vehicle mode is an Indy
race car, and is a bit big for a basic. (Not that I'm complaining.) This
mode looks very cool, with no extras whatsoever, unless you look very closely.
The middle of the hands are visible from the back side, and the robot head
can be viewed if you rotate his engine missles, but that's it. The detailing
is pretty cool, and the yellow missles and laser attached to this race
car make it look ready for battle. The only downside to this mode is that,
besides the wheels, there are practically no other moveable parts- but
hey, it's a car, what'd ya expect?

    Robot mode isn't quite
as good as the vehicle mode, but still looks very cool. The face looks
quite futuristic and emotionless, like a Vehicon drone, and the laser on
top of his head accents this. The missiles mounted on the sides of his
arms are neat as well. This is the first basic I've seen with removable
missiles! The downside, though, is you have to actually push them out with
your finger- there's no firing mechanism. The missles, which are parts
of his engine in vehicle mode, look a bit like hockey pucks. This, when
coupled with his oversized lower legs and mask-like face, make this Vehicon
look a little like a hockey player! There are downsides to this mode, though.
There is a big extra- the front of the race car, which is attached to his
back, is odd-looking. Although it doesn't get in the arms' way much, there
is no locking mechanism, so it tends to get in the way when you move his
legs. The second problem is his oversized legs. Although this may be a
plus in your opinion, as it seems to resemble the old 80's line of Transformers,
it isn't, in my opinion, because it the bottoms don't even slightly resemble
feet, and look odd. The last problem is that his arms look like they're
in a continual shrugging position, and it looks weird. However, the pros
far outweigh the cons in this mode, so this mode ends up looking pretty
nice.

    A very nicely done Vehicon-
great in both modes. Highly recommended.

      Mirage is a real trickster - and like
most practical jokers, loves being devious. An experimental, high-speed
weapon created by Megatron to breach the intelligence gap between Vehicon
generals and their drones. Still, not very smart. Would be useless without
Megatron's supervision. Enjoys playing tricks on fellow Vehicons. Can appear
out of nowhere to attack Maximals. Sneakiest and most elusive of all Vehicons.
Top speed of 300 miles per mega-cycle. Can instantly teleport up to 200
yards. Wields plasma mine blaster and dual missile launchers. Unpopular
amongst fellow warriors.
