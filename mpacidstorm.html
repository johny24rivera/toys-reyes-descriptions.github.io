    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Masterpiece Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Masterpiece
Starscream

     Well, this is a redeco
that's a bit of surprise. For a mold this expensive, I didn't think Hasbro
would delve into the lesser-known Starscream redecos, but here we are.
This version of Acid Storm is noticeably different in colors than his
     <a href="acidstorm.html">
      first
toy
     </a>
     , though-- the main green plastic here is a very light, nearly fluorescent
color, and one that is quite fitting for someone with his name. That said,
because of how loud the green is, Acid Storm is certainly going to stand
out on a Masterpiece shelf, given how rather realistic the rest of the
line is when it comes to color schemes. There's also some black and a few
different shades of gray used to help contrast against all the green--
the black works quite well, though I wish it had been used a bit more.
The painted metallic gunmetal parts also look great, though the milky gray
and charcoal dark gray plastic are rather bland colors that don't have
the benefit of contrasting against Acid Storm's bright green nearly as
well as the black does. Additionally, there's a bit of transparent bluish
green plastic used for the cockpit windows, which complement the main colors
nicely. I really wish the yellow and pale blue from his Universe 2.0 toy
had been used more prominently, and not just a tiny bit of yellow for the
tips of his chest-missile pods. Besides the bright green, what makes this
Acid Storm toy stand out are the interesting "jungle camo" paint jobs on
the tops of his wings, which look pretty cool, and are a bit of departure
from the more common "curvy" camo paint apps. Unfortunately, the camo disappears
rather upbruptly on the rear "stabilizer fins" of his main wings, which
looks a bit disconcerting in vehicle mode. The camo also isn't on the underside
of the wings which-- while understandable-- does definitely give his color
scheme a louder feel when viewed from the underside/backside. Acid Storm
has two "army names" underneath the sides of his cockpit-- "SSGT. EPITSONE"
apparently refers to the graffiti artist of the same name, while "MSGT.
B. "VICIOUS" VALA" refers to Hasbro toy designer Bobby Vala. (Talk about
obscure!) Unfortunately, unlike Masterpiece Thundercracker, Acid Storm
doesn't have any other "nudge, nudge" paint apps-- just camo paint apps,
some gunmetal gray, and Decepticon symbols on both his main wings and his
shoulders.

     Masterpiece Acid Storm
doesn't have any changes made specifically to this mode, but he does have
the same base changes to the mold made that
     <a href="mpthundercracker.html">
      Masterpiece
Thundercracker
     </a>
     has. It is also worth noting that, having been used
so often, the mold is starting to degrade a bit with this release-- the
rear wings come off at the drop of a hat in particular, but Acid Storm's
main wings also can snap off when transforming him (though thankfully,
they snap off at a point where it's easy to re-connect them).

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Masterpiece Acid Storm
is definitely going to stand out amongst the Masterpiece Seekers, what
with such a loud color scheme. Although I appreciate the colorists going
for something a bit different, I feel his green could've been toned down
a bit more and coupled with another main color besides black/gray, and
the lack of camo paint on his wing fins is rather weird. If you're a big
Seeker collector, than obviously this is a no-brainer of a purchase, but
otherwise this is probably a skip despite the high rating, due to the obscure
nature of the character, the price, and what I think is a rather ugly color
scheme overall.

       Little is known about the mysterious
air warrior Acid Storm. He serves quietly and anonymously under his commander
Starscream and lord Megatron. He speaks rarely, but when he does, it is
in passionate defense of the Decepticon cause. His oratory skill is so
great that those few who hear him speak believe he has a great future among
the Decepticons. But Acid Storm has no ambition other than to soar high
in the sky, seeding clouds with the deadly corrosive rain that gives him
his name.
