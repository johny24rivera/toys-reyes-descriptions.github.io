    Hatchet's vehicle mode
is a fighter jet. Now, you might be asking, is this a toy-only movie character,
since we didn't see such a vehicle in the movie? Well, yes and no. Hatchet
was in the movie-- as is more apparent in robot mode, he's one of the three
"Dreads", the black SUVs that transform into robots with "dreadlocks" in
that one highway scene. However, Hasbro apparently decided that making
three different black Decepticon SUV designs wasn't a market-savvy move
(and I tend to agree), so they changed Hatchet's vehicle mode for his release.
Anyways, that aside, Hatchet's jet mode is pretty nice-looking overall--
the wings are a tad small proportionally, but that's it. There is, unfortunately,
a little undercarriage "junk" as is the case with most jet TFs-- you can
see part of his legs below the rear wings, and more obviously two of his
feet hanging out the back end near the thrusters. However, the undercarriage
extras aren't so bulky that they really take away much from the mode, only
making the belly come down a little more than it should have. The silver
cockpit, thrusters, and gold paint apps on the wings help to break up the
black on Hatchet a little bit, though perhaps another decorative paint
app or two on the main body of the jet would've helped a bit more, as his
main body is pretty much just entirely black. His nosecone is also a rather
ugly "dirty" off-white shade that I'm not fond of. Hatchet has one flip-down
landing gear underneath the cockpit and he has two detachable missile accessories
that store underneath his wings. What's quite cool about these accessories
is that the middle parts can flip around to become chain guns-- surprise!
Now THAT'S what Transformers are all about, heh.

    Hatchet certainly turns
into one unique robot, being four-legged (with his hind legs being a bit
shorter than his front) with a tail, side cannons, and a positively demonic-looking
head. Really, his face is very well-detailed (as are all his robot bits)--
the sheer number of bronze teeth there, next to his red eyes, is just insane.
It's amazing just how different he looks from his relatively "normal" vehicle
mode, which I love. The nosecone becomes his tail, and is very well-segmented
to (largely) look long enough and thin enough to be an actual tail, cockpit
window piece notwithstanding. His weapons can still be pegged into the
wings (now his shoulders), and a bit that I find particularly impressive--
especially on a toy of this scale-- is that the big gap left on his back
when you swing out the robot head is filled in by another piece whose sole
purpose is simply to cover up that hole! His hind legs are probably the
weakest point of the figure, being a bit more obviously angular fragments
of his jet mode and not sporting the same insane amount of detail as his
other robot pieces, but they still are easily identifiable as legs. As
far as articulation goes, Hatchet can move up-and-down at the neck, as
well as at the front shoulders (at two points), front knees, front ankles,
rear shoulders, rear knees, rear ankles, and at three different points
among his tail. And, given his four-legged nature, stability is obviously
no problem, so he can get into a TON of great poses, particularly for a
Commander class figure.

    Hatchet is hands-down
my favorite Commander-sized toy out of the Dark of the Moon toyline, with
an inventive transformation, a pretty nice jet mode with only a little
bit of undercarriage kibble, and an absolutely OUTSTANDING, incredibly
original robot mode that's well-proportioned pretty much all around. If
you at all like the movie style of TFs or want more unconventional robot
modes, this is an absolute must-buy.

      Decepticon Hatchet enforces his commanders'
wishes with merciless efficiency. Fast and heavily armed, this Decepticon
is not to be underestimated. His four-legged robot mode allows for superior
mobility on the galaxy's roughest terrain.
