    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Megatron toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Voyager Megatron toy

     It's interesting what
a difference a paint job makes on a toy, even when the original paint job
was already fairly accurate. What the "Premium Edition" of Voyager class
Megatron has done to make it Premium is pretty much coated the toy in a
beautiful, BEAUTIFUL shade of metallic gunmetal silver. But lest that's
not enough, he's also got a very nice black paint wash over most of his
parts, resulting in a "beat-up, dirty" look that almost exactly matches
his appearance in the live action movie, metallic sheen and all. The black
paint wash on his legs is especially impressive, covering all the nooks
and crannies of his considerable mold detailing while being so much it
takes away from his metallic sheen. The dabs of red on his optics go PERFECTLY
with his black-washed, in-shadow face surrounding by the metallic gunmetal
head. That's easily my favorite part of this toy-- everything about the
face is just so perfectly EVIL. The metallic copper forms a brilliant contrast
against the metallic gunmetal, and though I wish the charcoal black plastic
parts were a purer black, that's a REALLY minor quibble. The ice color
on Megatron has been replaced with a whiter, "purer" ice that more closely
matches the ice he breaks out of in the movie. It's a fine color by itself,
but adding a silver transition coating to the most of it really makes it
look nice and shiny.

Megatron may not be that great of a mold, but MAN he has such an incredibly
sweet paint job. He immediately catches the eye even when surrounded by
other Transformers toys, and just looks so incredibly evil, the way his
colors are situated and play off of each other. If you at all like Movie
Megatron's design, GET THIS TOY if you can find one for a reasonable price.
If you're at all like me, any problems you have with the mold will be easily
overshadowed by all this awesome metallic paint.

       Locked in frozen stasis for hundreds
of years, the vast and monstrous mind of mighty Megatron slept and dreamed
of conquest. His conscious memory of that time is fragmented and confused
- a stop motion zoetrope of images that filtered into his optic processors
during periods of slight warmth. He remembers a vast herd of shaggy creatures
nearly as big as himself; a tribe of tiny, primitive organics who worshipped
his inert body as a god; the heat and fire of battle likely fought over
the incredible technology encased in his form. Now, for the first time,
however, he feels his entire body coming alive again as warmth and a complete
sensorium return. Megatron rises to functionality. He rises again to revenge.
