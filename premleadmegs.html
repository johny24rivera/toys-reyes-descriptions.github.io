    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Leader
Megatron toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Leader Megatron toy

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Premium Megatron has
a duller, less colorful color scheme than the original release of the mold,
but it is more show-accurate. Unfortunately, unlike his
     <a href="bestbuymegs.html">
      Voyager
class Premium figure
     </a>
     , he's not covered in that sweet, sweet metallic
silver paint-- his plastic is still normal gray plastic, though it's a
considerably darker shade this time with a hint of glitter in it to give
off a touch of shiny-ness. His black and metallic bronze paint apps are
essentially the same as his original version, which is unfortunately, given
the whole "Premium" aspect of the figure should mean substantially more
(and more accurate) paint apps, which would have made a larger proportion
of his body painted black than actually is. Still, a light black paint
wash has been added to some parts of the figure, such as the lower arms,
upper legs, and wings, that make his armor look a little worn. It IS a
very light wash, though-- unless you're viewing him under a strong light,
only the paint wash on his wings in vehicle mode is really noticeable.
Another improvement on the original figure is the replacing of the odd
transparent pinkish color used for his optics and pop-up wings with a much
more reasonable red shade. Also, his "icy blue" paint spray apps have been
completely removed, again for a more movie-accurate look.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Premium Leader Megatron, though the sound activated when you
press up on his chest to complete his transformation is now the classic
G1 transformation sound.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Premium Leader Megatron
is certainly an improvement over the original, what with the subtle "worn"
paint wash, the transparent red plastic, and the removal of those clashing
icy blue paint apps, but he's not different enough from the original Leader
class toy to warrant a second purchase if you already have the first version.
If you don't have either version yet, though, than by all means give this
version a go. (I'd recommend Premium VOYAGER Megatron over any of the other
releases of this toy, though, because of the aforementioned sweet metallic
silver paint covering him.)

       Megatron reboots to full awareness as
he shakes from his mighty frame the melting ice that has held him prisoner
for ten thousand years. For the past century, he has recorded every word
spoken in his presence, every experiment performed on his body, every indignity
to which he has been subjected, and now he will have his revenge. Though
the puny weapons of the humans may scratch his armor, nothing will stand
in the way of his fury.
