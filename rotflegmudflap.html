    Mudflap's Chevy Trax
vehicle mode is a bit squat. I mean, I know it's a Legends class figure
so it's not exactly going to be as accurate to the vehicle mode as a larger
figure, but this pushes the limits a bit. The edges look a bit rougher,
more "square" than the actual vehicle, which the
    <a href="rotfmudflap.html">
     deluxe
version of Mudflap
    </a>
    does a much better job of replicating. Still, despite
the proportions it's not outright BAD, as there are no robot extras to
speak of. There are some lines running throughout his vehicle mode (due
to the pieces seperating there for robot mode) that are a bit unsightly
even at this scale, however. The orange/gray/black color scheme isn't particularly
exciting, but it works, and helps Mudflap stand out a bit among a shelf
full of Movie toys, as there aren't that many orange TFs in the line. The
gray does a decent enough job of breaking up the orange, though I wish
there was a bit more of another color to mix things up visually a tad more.

    In robot mode, Mudflap
does a decent job of replicating his on-screen model at such a small scale,
but they really overdid it with how asymmetrical his arms are. Yes, his
left arm is larger than his right, but not but THIS much. Geez, that's
a monster claw he's got there! Almost makes him look like he only works
out one of his arms or something. Otherwise, the proportions are pretty
decent-- the car doors form nice shoulder panels, the front of the car
makes a nice chest, and his legs-- though a bit flat and two-dimensional--
are about the right length. His head sculpt is still scary ugly, but then
again, that's accurate to the film. Also, other than small plastic bits
framing a few pieces like his head, he doesn't have any outright vehicle
mode kibble, which is a plus. As for his articulation, it's roughly average
for a Legends figure-- he can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows,
and hips. He could really use some knee articulation, but that's the only
major point missing.

    RotF Legends class Mudflap
is a decent enough representation of the character at the size, though
there's a couple of rather goofy proportions problems, such as the overall
"square, squat" look of his vehicle mode and the absolutely ridiculous
left arm, that keep him from really being as good as he could be at this
scale.
