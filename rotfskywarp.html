    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Voyager Starscream toy

     Like pretty much every
toy every named Skywarp, this toy is an homage to the G1 Starscream
     <a href="g1skywarp.html">
      repaint
     </a>
     of the same name, and has a similar paint job. Black is Skywarp's main
color here, with purple and some gray/silver as secondary colors. He takes
the classic scheme and ups the ante a bit, though. The purple paint is
a really nice-looking metallic shade, and the purple plastic looks pretty
good as well-- both really go well against the black and gray. Plus, his
deco job in his vehicle mode isn't slavishly G1-- it has, in my opinion,
a much more eye-catching color scheme with the metallic purple stripes,
the couple of silver paint apps to add in some more contrast, and the Decepticon
emblems on the tailfins. The robot mode brings in my favorite part of Skywarp's
color scheme, though, and that's the red. The red used for his chest and
kneecaps REALLY pops, and just looks fantastic against the black. Really,
I can't overstate enough how nice those couple of paint apps are. Skywarp's
gray is a bit on the meh side, but it's really only visible in robot mode
much and using silver paint on all those parts would have been impractical
anyways. At least it's not the super-dull LIGHT milky gray seen on many
Movie TFs...

     RotF Skywarp has the
same remolded G1-esque head that
     <a href="movthundercracker.html">
      Movie
Thundercracker
     </a>
     has, but doesn't have any mold alterations that are
unique to this version. And I don't mind the altered head on this toy as
much, since he's already mostly black, so having a black head doesn't feel
too forced in this case.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     RotF Skywarp's actual
figure is so-so, but as seems to be the case with most Skywarp redecos,
he's got a fantastic red. The metallic purple and cherry red really seal
the deal, particuarly in robot mode. If you're going to get one version
of this mold, make it this one.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Skywarp has never been interested in
power or conquest. He simply wishes to be left alone in his pursuit of
knowledge. He joined the Decepticons because Megatron was willing to give
him facilities in which to work, and simply leave him alone. In return,
he has produced countless powerful weapons and experimental systems for
his comrades. He is personally equipped with mighty weapons that can twist
the very fabric of reality into a smear of color and light, or rip mountains
apart.
