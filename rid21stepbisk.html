    Bisk's alternate mode
is a sportscar, but it has a bit of a "lobster-y" twist, giving a hint
at his robot mode. For one, the front side sections around the wheels definitely
look like claw halves (and on this toy, actually are). Behind the car windows,
as the hood tapers off to the back, there's also cool ridged details like
a lobster tail. So that's all pretty cool, and a nice little twist on what
is otherwise your typical Transformer alt mode. Bisk is almost all smooth
curves, with a round roof and fairly round side sections encircling most
of his wheels. His proportions are pretty spot-on, and for the most part
there's no robot mode extras in this mode. However, on the back end, the
shape of the feet are pretty obvious (though at least there's mold details
of the rear bumper molded into the bottom of said feet), and the top of
Bisk's head pokes out a bit underneath the feet. Still, overall that's
prettty minor, especially for a 1-step changer. The color scheme is pretty
basic-- it's orange. Y'know, like a lobster. That said, although orange
is the overwhelming main color on this toy, it's a good shade of orange--
it's a milky, semi-metallic shade, with some glitter in there. There is
some black to help contrast against it, but this is definitely a VERY orange
toy. The mold details outside of the aforementioned lobster-esque details
are fairly minimal-- typical for a toy from this line-- with a few robotic
or stylized lines here and there, along with some square details on the
front grill, but otherwise he's fairly sparse in that respect. For paint
apps, there is a widened "T" detail on the front bumper, which fits with
the usual generic details on RID2015 toys when it comes to the front grill
of the alt mode. There's also some black on the windows, and some silver
on the side headlights (with the actual headlights themselves painted a
nice shade of fairly light blue). Otherwise there's no paint in this mode,
but given that Bisk's alt mode is almost entirely orange on the show--
and this isn't a very large toy-- this isn't as big of an issue as it usually
would be.

    Simply flip the rear
section of Bisk's alt mode (his feet) forward and pretty much everything
else auto-transforms-- except for the bottom part of each of his claws,
you have to flip out each of those manually. Because of the transformation,
this mode is a bit hunched-over-- which Bisk actually isn't much on the
show, so it's a bit of an odd take on the design. On the main body and
legs, you can see the mid-section of the car clearly peaking out behind
that entire section of the toy. On the main body it doesn't stick out too
much, but on the legs it's rather obnoxious, with rather large "shells"
sticking out between his legs, which are molded into a rather odd squat
stance-- outside of that, though, they're fairly accurate, with the angular
kneecaps, two-toed feet, and faux overlapping armor panels on the side.
The main body-- if you, again, ignore the car bits coming off the side--
is also sculpted pretty well, with the RID2015 usual black angular line
across the chest and some angular details on the abs and waist. His headsculpt
is definitely one of the most unique TF heads around, looking much more
like a lobster head than a "normal" TF head, complete with antennae, two
little bits coming down out of his mouth like a little "beard", a small
flat mouth, and uneven eyes. Even for Bisk, though, this head is a bit
wackier than normal, with the un-evenness of the eyes and antennae really
making him like he's having a fit. His robot-exclusive paint apps in this
mode are all on the main body and head, with black on the waist and chest,
a glossy fuchsia on the abs, silver on the nose, and blue on the eyes.
The black pieces help break up his orange a bit more in this mode, though
I wish there was a bit of paint on, say, the feet to make them stick out
more. The entire side sections of the car form his rather bulky arms, which
are definitely a little oversized for this toy given how much of his mass
they make up. That said, by themselves they're pretty good, with the wheels
in appropriate places on the shoulders and in the middle of each claw.
I wish the bottom portions of the claws weren't black so they could blend
in with the rest of his arms a bit better, but otherwise it all looks pretty
good. For articulation, Bisk can move back-and-forth at the elbows and
at the base of each of his bottom claws, but that's it-- not much, but
then again, articulation isn't the aim of 1-step changers.

    He has a good alt mode,
but the 1-step changer version of Bisk has a pretty funky robot mode, even
for Bisk-- the claws are too oversized, he's got some significant kibble
behind his body and legs, and his whole body is oddly curved as a result
of the transformation. I still love this design overall, but he definitely
has better toys-- even better simplistic toys-- made of him in the line.
