     original
"Masterpiece" Optimus Prime
    </a>
    was an outstanding toy, but it was missing
one major thing-- his trailer! Optimus Prime's second Masterpiece toy helps
to rectify that problem, but the core Optimus Prime toy is a brand new
mold too, taking advantage of various engineering enhancements made since
the first Masterpiece version was released back in 2004. In his truck with
trailer mode, Optimus is incredibly accurate to how he looked in the original
G1 cartoon, and proportionally spot-on. His red and blue are very primary
colors which hearken back to how he looked in the 'toon, and he's also
got a good amount of silver chrome, too-- namely, on his smokestacks (they
aren't "clippped down" this time!), wheel hubs, front bumper, headlights,
and grill (both the vehicle and "fake" robot one), and parts of the sides
of his truck cab. What I find best of all about his color scheme is that
there's VERY little gray plastic in this mode (though if you open up his
trailer, it's the primary color on the inside); instead, nearly all of
the parts that would normally be gray on a mass-retail toy are coated with
a gorgeous shade of silver here. It particularly looks great on his trailer,
which admittedly would've looked a little boring otherwise. All of the
expected mold detailing is here, right down to the fake "bolts" on the
sides of his truck mode, little stepladders, door detailing, the iconic
white-and-blue stripes along the sides of his trailer; everything. (The
stripe looks particularly dynamic on this large of a toy and on the silver
trailer). All of the appropriate parts are transparent, as well; his front
windows, his taillights on his trailer, the yellow "fake truck lights"
on his robot waist. The only part that could really stand to be transparent
that isn't are his truck cab's bottom rear headlights (the top rear headlights
are clear plastic). His tires are also rubber (or at least rubber-like
plastic), so he rolls along a flat surface with no problem. The part where
his trailer attaches to his cab is also fairly well-secure too, consisting
of two fairly deep pegs and corresponding holes that also allow the cab
to angle in a different direction a fair bit compared to the trailer. Unless
you pick up Prime by the trailer, it'll stay connected unless you mean
to disconnect it-- and even when you do the former, it still tends to "stick"
for a split second before the two parts of the vehicle mode finally come
apart. As is the case with Masterpiece figures, the details in the truck
mode's functions really help to give it that extra bit of playability.
His front windows can open up, and-- although there's not a convincing
driver's area inside (you can see the back of Prime's head), you can fit
the little Spike Witwicky (non-poseable) figurine he comes with inside
his cab! That's pretty impressive, given his transformation. The rear hitch
of his trailer can also open up and a ramp can slide out to let Masterpiece-scaled
cars (or smaller) roll up inside-- he can fit about two at a time in there.
Also, although it's admittedly a little thing, I like how his little rear
view mirrors can flip out in this mode to look more "genuine" instead of
simply being molded against his side windows or ignored as they often are.
If you take off the trailer, Optimus Prime does have one very minor robot
mode extra, and that's his waist with the fake truck headlights that are
visible right behind the red part of the cab. (The feet fold in a mildly
convincing manner to form his cab's taillights.) This is admittedly not
perfect, but it's so minor compared to all of Prime's other awesome abilities
I have a tough time taking off anything for it.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
to robot mode takes a lot of cues from his first Masterpiece toy, but streamlines
certain sections and adds certain little extras that make him look just
that much better and more animation-accurate in this mode. It still consists
of a lot of steps-- the waist/lower truck cab area can be tricky-- but
it isn't quite as
    <i>
     frustrating
    </i>
    as his first Masterpiece outing, if
you know what I mean. Little things like having panels cover up the wheels
on the sides of his legs, having his smokestacks being able to shorten
and elongate, the way his blaster can store in his upper back if you so
choose, the way his leg detailing is hidden in vehicle mode-- it's all
very well-done. Some of the features of his 1.0 Masterpiece version are
missing-- no flip-up communicators, talking mouthpiece, or glowing Matrix
here-- but given the better proportions, I feel that the sacrifice was
worth it, with the exception of the "talking" gimmick, which I felt was
really great. (Don't worry, though-- he still does have the Matrix inside
of his chest, it just doesn't have an electronic feature this time around.)
As far as the mode itself goes, I really don't have a negative thing to
say about it at all-- the proportions are absolutely PERFECT to the extent
where you just gotta wonder how the heck that robot turns into that vehicle.
He is also extremely, EXTREMELY poseable, being able to move at the neck
(at three points), at the base of each antennae (!), at the shoulders (at
three points), elbows (at two points), at the base and mid-point of each
of his index fingers, at the base of his three small fingers on each hand
(all as one piece), at the wrist, the waist, the hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points). Given how completely
kibble-free he is and how nice and tight (but not too tight) his ratcheting
joints are, you can get him into a RIDICULOUS amount of poses. No issues
here at all. All of the necessary paint is here too, such as the silver
on his chest, waist, and lower legs, his face paint apps, and the like.
It is worth mentioning here that this version of MP Optimus Prime is slightly
shorter than the first, due to the inclusion of a trailer on this version
(this robot comes up to the bottom of MP Prime 1.0's chest), but it really
doesn't suffer at all for it, and with the almost complete lack of diecast,
it means that none of his joints are too heavy to stay in a pose, either.

    As for Optimus Prime's
trailer, it's pretty much exactly a large-scale replica of how his original
G1 trailer base looked, being pretty much a box that folds out. (It can
be stood up on end to serve as a personal "repair bay" for the Prime figure,
though this is literally just standing it up on its end and nothing more.)
There's a ramp for Prime's little "Roller" vehicle to slide down. Roller
himself
is well-painted and well-detailed with nothing remotely major missing,
and slides on all four (plastic) wheels quite well. The large "repair crane-thing"
is also intact here at a larger scale, and the cockpit is able to hold
the Spike Witwicky minifigure too. The repair crane is also moveable at
several places, including five places along the "neck", two places along
the "satellite dish arm", and six places along the "claw arm". There's
also loads of tech-like mold detailing along the inside of the trailer,
though most of them are somewhat hollow-- that still doesn't quite keep
them from looking cool, though. Prime's two weapons can be stored in the
cavities in the "back" of the base mode-- his (non-firing) blaster and
his axe accessory. His blaster can be held both in one of Prime's hands
or even by Roller (near the back end), and the large transparent "energy
axe" weapon fits around one of Prime's fists semi-snugly, though not QUITE
as snugly as I'd like.

    No, I didn't make a
mistake on Masterpiece Optimus Prime 2.0's rating-- this is the first toy
I have EVER reviewed that actually gets a perfect score. The incredible
engineering, 99% lack of kibble in both modes, fully functional trailer,
unbelievable posability, and the many "little touches" like the ability
of the Spike minifigure to sit in two different places on the toy, the
way his blaster folds up, and how well his leg and chest transformations
work just completely obliterate even the smallest of downsides and say
"GET THEE GONE". A HIGHLY recommended purchase for any Transfan, particularly
if you can get it near the retail price-- as you can imagine, this toy
was a hot seller, and he's gone up quite a bit in price since then, but
even with a 50% or so markup I still feel he's very much worth it. GET
THIS TOY.
