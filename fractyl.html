    Beast mode is a green
pterodactyl. Looks very nice from the top, and has a very nice color combination
to it. However, the silver lever does stick out a bit on his back and there
are his robot leg extras on the underside, which kind of get in the way
a bit. His robot hands are also clearly visible on the back of his beast
legs. His mouth can open and close, though, which is a nice feature, and
the beast legs can move too. That's it for articulation- the wings can't
even flap. The detailing isn't too good on this transformer.

    Robot mode has a nice
coloration to it, but also has a big extra that always seems to get in
the way; the wings. There is no place to tuck and fold the wings, and it
doesn't seem to fit in with the robot. His robot parts are very nice-looking,
though, and have a nice shine to them. His gun is very small, and it can
fall out of its storage space very easily, making it easy to lose.

    A very nice repaint

    , one of the ones that is better.
Recommended over Terrorsaur if you're willing to pay the high price for
him.

      While Megatron pushes him to be a warrior,
Fractyl is more concerned with solving the problems caused by the strange
planet's surplus of Energon. The other Predacons either ignore him or ridicule
his apparent fascination with the energy source, despite the fact that
his work could provide them with the means for ultimate victory over the
Maximals. While his research has only temporary success, he is confident
that he will eventually resolve their recurring overload problems, thereby
earning the others' respect.
