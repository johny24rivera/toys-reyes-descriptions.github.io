    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is pretty much what you'd expect at this point-- he's a orangish-yellow-and-black
Chevrolet Camaro, of the newest model (as of the time of the movie), with
the most noticeable difference for this version being the more slanted
headlights. The vents on the front hood are also a bit more pronounced,
as well. Generally the proportions in this mode are very good-- as you'd
expect from a TF with a licensed alt mode. You can see little bits of the
robot mode inside the side windows (which are "open" and not filled up
with transparent plastic or anything), and there's some rather ugly lines
across his windshield due to his transformation, but the rest of this mode
is devoid of robot extras. (That said, due to the mold breakup the middle
sections of the front grill are black but not the sides, which is a bit
odd). The paint apps are what are absolutely needed, and basically no more--
'Bees got the one thick stripe going down the top of this mode with the
little stripes right beside it, and the headlights and rear and front windshield
are painted a nice metallic silvery blue, which is pretty typical paint
used for windows and contrasts nicely with the orange-yellow; there's also
a bit of black on the rear bumper, though the taillights are unpainted,
which is a bummer. The rear spoiler also should've been painted as well.
Overall there's enough to make for a decent color scheme, but only just;
I wish just a few more paint apps/colors were visible in this mode to liven
things up a bit.

    Bumblebee's Power Battler
gimmick is a "Power Punch"; in robot mode his right fist is hugely oversized.
When you rotate 'Bee at the waist to the right, his right arm extends forward
a pretty good amount for said "punch"; the waist's default position is
facing straightforward, though, so as soon as you let go of the waist the
fist will go back to its neutral position, shown above. The core robot
body, upper legs, and robot head are the highlights of this mode; all three
are quite excellently proportioned, and have oodles of that really nice
mold detailing we've come to expect from movieverse toys. The headsculpt
is spot-on, complete with a black stripe down the middle of the head, a
silver face, and blue eyes. The silver paint on the piston "abs" and black
on the faux car chest looks good, as well. The waist and upper legs also
look pretty good and proportional, fitting in with 'Bee's more angular
appearance for this movie. Unfortunately, his feet and arms are where this
mode fall apart. The left arm is okay, but more what I'd expect from a
Legion-sized figure; the arm is merely molded onto the inside of a big
part of the car mode (in this case, most of one of the rear sides of the
car mode). It generally doesn't look good. The biggest issue is with 'Bee's
"Power Punch" arm, which simply sacrifices too much for its gimmick. It
can't be posed at all, and is stuck in its "collapsed" configuration where
Bumblebee basically has a third of the car mode hanging off his arm, with
a fair amount of extending behind his back as well. (Even when "punching"
forward, it still looks off.) At least there's some rather cool semi-metallic
greenish blue paint on the top of the first, though; it goes quite well
with the other colors and is quite a unique shade, to the point where I
wish it was used a bit more on the toy. The legs are also pretty weak,
being simply the halves of the vehicle front with little panels of detailing
folded onto the front that look like hollow detailing of Bumblebee's leg
details on the movie model. First off, the detailing panels are way too
small, and don't cover up the car halves much at all, making them look
doubly weird; and second, the hollow detailing just doesn't look good,
not like more "normal" mold detailing such as that on 'Bee's chest and
upper legs does. At least he's got little protrusions at the rear of his
car half-feet, though, so he's pretty stable. For articulation-- ignoring
the "Power Punch" gimmick-- Bumblebee can move at the right shoulder (at
two points), and backwards at each knee. Thus he's not poseable at all;
granted this isn't the focus of the Power Battler toys, but I don't see
why head rotation or hip movement wasn't added.

    Power Battler Bumblebee
has a pretty decent vehicle mode, but his "Power Punch" gimmick in robot
mode is simply too much of a sacrifice; there's no way you can make his
robot mode appear naturally posed, and having one huge oversized fist constantly
reared back in comparison to one normal-sized arm just looks odd. His legs
are also very weak-looking and a disappointment; one of the worst Power
Battler molds, and not recommended. If you want a simpler AoE Bumblebee
toy, go for the Flip 'n Change figure instead.
