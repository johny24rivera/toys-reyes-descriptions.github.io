    Mold History
   </b>
   : Midnight Express was
a completely new mold created for Car Robots (which subsequently became
Robots in Disguise).

    Vehicle mode is a bullet
train. This mode is very nice, and excellently detailed- at least paint-wise.
The mold detailing is only mediocre, but then again, it's a bullet train-
not really a whole lot of detail TO mold in. I especially like the dark
blue lower half and the yellow lines. Midnight Express' (what the heck
of a kind of name is that!? I'll just call him Midnight for the rest of
this review) back half in this mode has "Max Cybertron" imprinted on both
sides, which is a nice touch. My only real complaint about Midnight in
this mode is that some of the spaces between the different parts- especially
the spaces near the middle and in the front- are a little wider than I'd
like them, and detract a bit from this mode, making it pretty obvious that
he's a "Robot in Disguise". Oh, and a neat little feature with Midnight
and the other Bullet Train members- he has a hook on the back side and
a similarly-sized hole on the bottom of his front side so that he can link
up with the other Bullet Train members. A nice touch.

    Midnight's robot mode-
well, let's just say it's not quite as good as his vehicle mode. First
and foremost, his legs are absolutely, ludicrously HUGE in proportion to
the rest of his both. I mean, they're easily over half of his total body
weight. That's insane. I mean, having legs being slightly larger proportionally
than normal, like with
    <a href="rapidrun.html">
     Rapid Run
    </a>
    and
    <a href="railspike.html">
     Railspike
    </a>
    ,
is alright, but this is really pushing it. Also, Midnight is slightly asymmetrical
in this mode, and in a rather odd and unappealing way, almost like it was
a mistake for him to be this way. His right shoulder plate is curved, while
the other is straight; and his two feet and heels are of different designs
as well. This just doesn't really look that good, unlike how asymmetry
worked well with the
    <a href="bwtransmetals2toys.html">

    </a>
    .
Also, there's a rather noticeable gap in between Midnight's head and the
top of his chest, which doesn't look that nice either. However, Midnight's
robot head is wonderfully done; like Railspike, it looks like he has a
miniature version of the front of a train on his forehead. He also has
a slight smirk on his face, with definitely adds character. Midnight is
also extremely posable in this mode, and he has practically no extras,
which is a definite plus. His weapon is your standard missle-firing gun
in this mode.

    Midnight Express has
a very nice vehicle mode, but his robot mode could be a bit better in its
proportions. My personal least favorite of the Bullet Trains, but he's
still a good toy overall- and, of course, he's needed to make Rail Racer.

      Midnight Express is the Bullet Train
teams friendly, easygoing junior member. He sets the mood for the team
with a cheerful, fun-loving attitude that will have everyone feeling upbeat
- yet when it comes to the enemy, hes tough and unrelenting. Hes good
in the cold: he melts snow with his heat missiles and slices icebergs down
to size with his light swords.
