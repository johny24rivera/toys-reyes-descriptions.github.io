    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Landmine. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Landmine

     The pre-Beast Wars form
of Rhinox fits exactly with his
     <a href="rhinox.html">
      Beast Wars self
     </a>
     when it comes to color scheme, pretty much color-for-color. A few colors
have been added, such as metallic silver, for the wheels and other details
as needed, but otherwise his color scheme is definitely recognizable as
good ol' Rhinox. The green is a great shade, and the blade and light bluish
gray really serve as nice colors against it. The brownish gray used for
the main color in the vehicle mode is a little more gray and a little less
brown when compared to his Beast Wars form, but this was needed since it's
a more vehicle-y color than a beast-y shade. The paint applications are
great, as well-- the dull bronze on the shovel and the robot legs looks
especially nice, as it approximates the bronze spray fade on the original
toy without downright copying it. The head, which is not remolded at all
from Landmine's, bears a bit of a resemblance to Rhinox regardless, but
with the very well-detailed gold paint apps around the face that emphasizes
the chin and eyebrows while de-emphasizing the small head antennae, it
makes the toy look a lot more recognizable as Big Green. Plus, the Cyber
Key-activated turbines on his face make great "Machine Guns o' Doom" duplicates
when rotated over his head to face forward-- they have the small spikes
on their sides and everything!

     Rhinox has no mold changes
when compared to Landmine. The only place where this really gets to be
a problem is the molded-in Autobot symbol on Rhinox's chest. He still has
painted Maximal insignias on the sides of his legs, but the Botcon website
tried to explain this away by saying he admires the Autobots so much he
keeps their insignia on him as a reminder of the ideals they stood for.
A cop-out? Yeah, you bet, but again, there's only so much remolding Fun
Publications can do with their money, and this, rightly, didn't take priority.
There's also a bit of an assembly error-- his shoulders are on backwards.
But, it's nothing that a quick unscrewing and swapping of parts can't fix,
so it's really no big deal at all. Also, like all the other toys in the
Botcon set, the Cyber Key used in the Cybertron version has instead been
replaced with a solid gray Planet X Key bearing a Maximal symbol and a
painted bit of Golden Disk detailing over the main part of the Cyber Key,
hence the new name "Golden Disk Key".

     Axalon Rhinox is a great
repaint of an already great toy, and with those gold paint apps on the
face and the right colors, he really does look genuinely like Rhinox, even
without any remolding done to the toy. One of the best mold choices for
the Botcon 2006 set, in my opinion.

       Looking upon the powerful form of "Rhinox",
one would imagine he is engineered to be a terrible machine of destruction.
However, the truth is, the large Maximal is one of the gentlest souls you
will ever encounter. His entire being is focused around the defense of
life - from the largest space faring creature to the tiniest insect. His
function as a defense specialist belies his fearsome appearance, but make
no mistake, in combat Rhinox is one of the most brave and potent forces
on the battlefield. In robot mode, Rhinox is adept at close quarters hand-to-hand
combat, utilizing a brutal style that inflicts maximum damage with minimal
movement. His dense armor protects him from most forms of conventional
firepower. In vehicle mode, his powerful shovel can lift up to 50,000 tons.
The shovel, composed of a special alloy Rhinox developed himself, reflects
most energy weeapon's fire back to its source. Often serious, Rhinox does
have a congenial sense of humor that is neither mean-spirited nor spiteful.
Rhinox is an expert at defensive technology and tactics while also having
a vast knowledge of engineering, including weapons development and metallurgy.
These are just a few of the reasons Optimus Primal holds Rhinox's abilities
and counsel in the highest esteem.
