    I kept going back and
forth on whether I would classify the 1-step Ratchet mold as a "redeco/remold"
of the
    <a href="rid21stepstrongarm16.html">
     1-step (2016) Strongarm mold
    </a>
    ,
but eventually I decided it should get its own (mostly) full review as
opposed to an abbreviated redeco review, simply because SO MUCH of the
toy is new-- basically the mechanics of that Strongarm mold are kept inact
along with a few parts (most of them minor), and the rest is completely
changed. So, anyways, in vehicle mode Ratchet is, of course, an ambulance.
All in all this is a fairly solid mode proportionally, with no major maladies
(though the back end could stand to stick up a BIT more). Unfortunately
in a completely unnecessary move, the back end of the top portion is hollow,
so from a rear view you can see "inside" of the vehicle and see Ratchet's
lower legs up in there and everything. Of course, due to the transformation
the bottom of the feet are also blatantly obvious from the back end too,
so it's not like it looks all that good regardless. (The taillights are
molded onto the back end like you'd expect them to be.) All in all, however,
those are fairly minor issues for a 1-step changer. From a close comparison
to the 2016 1-step Strongarm mold, it becomes apparent that the wheels,
the front side sections (which become the robot arms), and most of the
front grill are taken from Strongarm, but the rest of this mold is new.
There's now more grill details near the center of the front section, and
as opposed to a molded-in Autobot symbol on Strongarm, there's merely an
Autobot symbol-shaped place for a paint app (which sadly doesn't have one)
on the front this time. The mold detailing on the rest of Ratchet is relatively
sparse, but on-par for a RID2015 toy, with some angular lines here and
there to break up the large relatively blank sections, some necessary details
like the windows and rear-view mirrors molded in, and not much else. What's
really lacking in this mode-- and easily its biggest weakness-- are the
paint apps. Almost all of Ratchet is white in this mode, the wheels being
the only plastic of another color that shows up. There's some red paint
on wheel covers and on the center portion of the front hood, and black
paint on the front window, but that's it-- his side windows are unpainted,
as is his roof. This makes for a pretty bland color scheme, overall-- yes,
it does have Ratchet's basic colors, but that's WAAAY too much white on
the middle and top sections.

    As you'd expect from
the toy, it transforms the same as the 1-step Strongarm mold already discussed--
you flip the entire top section of the vehicle mode over and onto the back
of the robot mode, and this auto-transforms everything else except the
arms, which you just fold downwards at the shoulders, and you're done.
The vehicle top section locks into place securely so it won't come undone
unless you want it to, but it's definitely the weak point on this mode,
as it sticks out from behind ALL of Ratchet's body, head, and legs, and
is quite the huge piece of kibble. If you ignore that huge bit, though,
the core robot proportions are pretty good. As discussed before, Ratchet
shares the same arms as Strongarm-- and, as is more evident in this mode,
the black portions of his main body and some minor connector pieces on
the shoulders are shared too-- but the rest of this mode is new. His chest
is sculpted like the RID2015-usual of having a blank, faux black window
on the center and little else on it. The headsculpt is spot-on, with Ratchet's
signature red headcrest, a no-nonsense look on his silver face, and moderately
light blue paint on his eyes. The rest of his head is white, with a relatively
large square chin, as befits his demeanor. The legs are also completely
new, with detailing calling back a bit more to Ratchet's
    <a href="priratchet.html">
     Prime
version
    </a>
    , with what look like large, pointy kneecaps, and some more
angular legs and feet. The sides of the rear portion of the vehicle mode
do hang off the sides of the lower legs a bit, but this is a relatively
minor issue for a 1-step changer, and again not that big of a deal when
you consider the entire top section is behind Ratchet here. The color scheme
is broken up much better in this mode, with not just the black plastic
and paint on his shoulders, chest, and waist, but a good amount of red
paint visible on his lower legs and on the wheel covers from vehicle mode,
plus the face paint apps I've already mentioned. (Oddly, though, there's
another one of those bits left on his chest that is in the SHAPE of an
Autobot symbol, but is completely ignored and painted over with black paint
like the rest of his chest.) As with Strongarm, Ratchet can move at two
points on the shoulders, but that's it-- articulation isn't the point of
1-step changers.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    While taking the same
general transformation of the 2016 version of 1-step Strongarm-- and a
few parts from her, as well-- Ratchet is extensive enough of a remold to
definitely be his own 'bot, and the most extensive remold of any of his
RID2015 toys. Hasbro did a decent job replicating his robot mode details
and the large section on the back of his vehicle mode, but this mold still
suffers from the same major issue as that version of 1-step Strongarm--
that is, a HUGE piece of vehicle extra on the back of the robot mode--
but makes that extra even bigger, and with not enough paint apps in vehicle
mode. Still, if you want an easy-to-transform version of RID2015 Ratchet
that's a decent size, this is your only option (and there are certainly
worse 1-step changers).
