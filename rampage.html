    Beast mode is a metallized
king crab. Almost half hiss body weight is hiss claws! Unless you look
on the bottom, there are no extras in this mode, and it fits together very
well, but doesnt snap together easily. He cant stand on his crab legs,
though, so he tends to rest on his belly.

    Vehicle mode is a crab
with his legs and claws turned into tank treads with a gun sticking out
from under his head. This mode is EXTREMELY hard to transform into, because
his tank treads cant roll well in many different configurations, so it
involves some playing around with his crab legs. If you can get it, it
looks nice, though. As he rolls along, his cannon rotates and fires, which
is a nice effect.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Robot mode is nice-looking,
but has a lot of extras. His crab legs stick out everywhere and get in
the way a lot. He cant stand up well because of all these extras. His
claws on his back also stick out a lot, too. His shoulder armor probably
sticks out the most, but it doesnt get in the way as much as the others.
His crab antennae stick out a bit on his chest as well. His chest and legs
are well structured, though, and his face is one of the most detailed ones
there is in the Beast Wars line. He has a missle launcher that can fire
three missles by rotating it, but you can accidently fire them easily.
He has another small gun, but this is sort of easy to lose.

    A nice-looking transformer,
although he is hard to transform to in vehicle mode and has a lot of extras
in robot mode.

      The result of an experiment gone awry,
Rampage is an evil titan devoid of mercy. Calculating and fearsome, he
is a legend among Cybertrons, and it is rumored that his spark cannot be
extinguished. In king crab mode Rampage uses his hulking claws to generate
colossal tidal waves, induce earthquakes, and trigger landslides. Though
his bulk hinders his overall dexterity, Rampage makes good use of his impenetrable
armor and multi-weapons arsenal in crab, tank and robot modes. Galva-conductors
on his back channel deadly electric currents that he disperses at will.
Rampage customarily activates is Gatling cannon to finish off his enemies
in a deluge of cluster missiles. All Cybertrons fear his unmatched aggression.
