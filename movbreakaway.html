    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Hot Shot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Cybertron Hot Shot

     Breakaway here is meant
to be a bit of an homage to G1 Getaway, and is painted very similarly.
"Getaway" was apparently unobtainable as a trademark, though, so Hasbro
used Breakaway instead. Homage or not, the color scheme looks fairly good
on the mold. White, blue, and black make for some great primary colors,
as they all contrast with each other very well, and all in all are very
"Autobot-y" colors. The dark red paint apps-- primarily visible in robot
mode-- also serve as another great contrast color. I'm not too fond of
the oddly pale light red used for the translucent parts, though-- it's
just not all that good-looking of a color. Another, more minor, complaint
I have about the color scheme is that the few yellow paint applications
used in robot mode are a rather sickly shade of a yellow-- a "purer" yellow
would have looked better, I think. Breakaway has quite the number of paint
applications himself, though-- there's no one large area that looks too
bland. Plenty of the dark red, black, and greenish yellow paint apps break
up the robot mode, and the blue stripes break up the white in vehicle mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to Movie Breakaway, though the mold's Speed Planet Cyber Key
has been exchanged for a transparent red Cyber Key that comes with most
of the other Movie Cybertron repaints.

     Movie Breakaway is a
great repaint and a great homage to a rather obscure G1 character. I don't
think the shades of translucent red or yellow on him are the best choices,
but otherwise he has a great color scheme and plenty of paint apps. While
I don't think he looks quite as good as a few other repaints of this mold--
particularly
     <a href="bcgoldbug.html">
      Botcon Goldbug
     </a>
     -- he's still a
great paint job on a great mold, so if you haven't picked this mold up,
by all means do so.

       Escape-artist extraordinaire Breakaway
has never been held in captivity for more than a few hours. Even then,
most of the times he's been captured have only been because he let it happen,
so he could get inside a Decepticon base and blow it up. Every one of his
joints is double, and secret compartments cover his body, hiding dozens
of tools for use in escaping from any cell. He's as slippery as a Neutronian
grease eel, and clever as a turbofox. Decepticon bounty hunters across
the galaxy have an almost supernatural regard for his skill.
