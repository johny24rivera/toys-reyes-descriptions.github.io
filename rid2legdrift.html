    Drift's legion-class
figure, proportionally, is very accurate in vehicle mode. If you really
REALLY want to look at it hard, it might be just a TAD wider than the show
model, but you're really splitting hairs, there. There's no robot mode
extras at all, which is always a plus, and the color scheme is pretty much
right-on-target when compared to most of his other figures. He's mostly
a medium-to-light-medium orange, with a fair amount of black. The wheels
and center portion of the back is made of black plastic, while the paint
apps on the front hood stripes, the front window, part of the side windows,
and on the center part of the front grill are a more metallic shade of
the color. For some weird reason only the front of the side windows are
painted black and not the back portion of the side windows, which looks
odd (the rear window is also not painted). The black and orange obviously
go well together, though there are a few other paint apps visible in this
mode. There's some dark red on the faux "robot crest" on the center bumper,
as well as on part of the stripes on the side doors (only on the back portions,
not the front portions, which is kind of a weird contrast when compared
with the aforementioned side window paint apps). Finally, the tiny headlights
on the front are painted a nice blue, which is really a pretty good shade
and I wish was used a bit more on the toy. Unfortunately, the back end
of this mode has no paint at all-- this looks particuarly odd on the partially
black/partially orange rear bumper, given that the mold details are there.
The other mold details on Drift in this mode are fairly sparse given the
sleek look of his sportscar mode, though when necessary there can be intricate
details, like the panel lines on the front bumper.

    Drift's transformation
is pretty typical for a Legion class car toy-- unfold the rear half to
make the legs and feet, the sides and part of the front become his shoulders
and arms, and then the hood folds behind his back. Little bits of the hood
stick out from behind the sides of the chest, but this is expected at this
small of a scale and honestly it doesn't stick out as much as on many other
similarly-structured Legion figures, so it's not a big deal. A bigger issue
with me are the arms, which I think are definitely the weakest part of
this toy-- the shoulders aren't quite big enough and don't look "solid"
enough as a result of the transformation, and the arms are mostly molded
on the inside of the car side pieces, and it's all just too stiff-looking.
The legs are better, being a bit over-sized on the lower portion but otherwise
pretty solid, with the car back ends mostly used for said legs and little
segments that flip up to form the feet. The square mold detailing on the
knees and the "skirt-like" designs on the waist are replicated quite well,
though unfortunately they have no paint to bring out those details. The
chest and head are very well-sculpted, with all the necessary details to
make Drift look like he's wearing some sort of samurai armor. There's some
black painting on the chest and the waist, though unfortunately not on
the shoulders; the head is very well-detailed, with a red headcrest, silver
face, and even TEENY-tiny black lines on the sides of his face and blue
on the eyes. For articulation, Drift can move at the shoulders (at two
points), hips, and back-and-forth at the knees and slightly up-and-down
at the ankles. Overall, that's above-average for a Legion figure, so kudos
to Hasbro for that.

    He has a few minor downsides--
the robot arms in particular, and a few details that really needed to be
painted-- but overall, Drift is a pretty solid Legion-class figure. He
may not "break the mold" in terms of design originality, but he's still
a great representation of the character if you're into Legion-class figures.
