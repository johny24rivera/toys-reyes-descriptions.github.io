    Well... if this huge
Darth Vader mech was in the movies, let's just say the end result would
probably have been very different, that's for sure. Darth Vader's alternate
mode this time is the freaking DEATH STAR, and surprisingly, it's absolutely
flawless. The thing's pretty much a perfect sphere, with little fold-on
stands on the bottom to keep it from rolling around. No Mech mode extras
whatsoever. There's tons of detailing-- as you'd expect on a toy that's
supposed to represent something as big as a moon-- with intricate white
paint in all the little cracks and crevices, and gray paint on all the
raised parts. Of course, having just a ball for an alternate mode wouldn't
be all that fun, even if it WAS the Death Star, so Vader comes with three
miniature TIE Fighters that are stored in one of the Death Star's two compartments
in this mode (the other holds his cape for Mech mode). The TIE Fighters
themselves are pretty sad, though, since their "transformation" consists
of lifting up a small part of the top of the cockpit to reveal a cyborg-like
eye. Oooo. They're also horribly out of scale compared to the Death Star,
but hey, they pretty much have to be if you don't want them to be the size
of a molecule. The Death Star's main weapon hasn't been forgotten, however--
by opening up a small hatch and pushing down on Vader's head inside, the
missile inside the big blaster on the Death Star (which is actually attached
to a gun in Mech mode-- pretty impressive engineering, that) will fire.
There's also a few sound effects you can activate, such as Darth Vader's
voice saying "You may fire when ready", then power-up sounds (accompanied
by parts around the gun sequentially lighting up before it actually fires--
VERY cool), and then a firing sound.

    A word about Vader's
transformation before I get to the Mech mode-- it's not too much of problem
to get him from Death Star mode to Mech mode, but it's a MAJOR paint to
get him back into his alternate mode. That's because you have to pushing
in on many, MANY pieces at the same time to get them to all finally click
into place at the final step, and everything has to line up just right.
It's probably the biggest complaint I have about the toy, and something
to keep in mind.

    Darth Vader's Mech mode
is so incredibly awesome it's easily worth the troublesome transformation,
however. Yeah, he has some Death Star "kibble", but most of it either tucks
out of the way well-- such as on his arms, the back of his legs, and his
back-- or actually complements the mode, such as the partial spheres behind
his shoulders. (The only notable exception to this rule is the pieces on
the sides of his lower legs, which stick out a bit but otherwise don't
get in the way of movement.) And speaking of movement, Darth Vader has
quite a lot of it-- he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points),
elbows (at two points), wrists, waist, hips (at two points), knees (at
two points), and a bit of movement at the ankles, so you can get a TON
of good poses out of him. Also, unlike many Star Wars Transformers in their
Mech modes, Darth Vader has nearly perfect proportions, with thicker appendages
than most SWTFs. Unfortunately, since SO MANY paint details were used on
his alternate mode, he doesn't have many visible in his robot mode (just
a few on his face or chest), although he still has tons of intricate mold
detailing. As far as special features, Vader has plenty, as you'd expect
from a $50 toy. Press on a button on his stomach, and he'll say a few phrases,
with a bright green light (BLINDINGLY bright) emanating from his chest
as he says them. "Join me on the Dark Side", "The Force is strong with
you", that sorta stuff (and these sounds, like the ones from his alternate
mode, are always followed by a few of Vader's characteristic breaths, as
well). As mentioned before, he's got a handheld spring-loaded missile launcher,
and a cape made of actual cloth that can be partially stuffed into the
alcove behind his head so that it flows down his back. VERY cool. He also
comes with a lightsaber (NOT storable in his alternate mode, unfortunately)
which, when pressed into his right fists, activates a "lightsaber-turning-on"
sound, followed by a "humming" sound that persists for a few seconds (and,
if you swing his arm quickly, some "clashing" sounds will emanate as well).
If pressure isn't continuously applied to the lightsaber, though, a "lightsaber-turning-off"
sound will emanate, and the effect will end. (It's AWFULLY loud, though--
geez, Hasbro, what speakers did you hook this think up with?) Also as expected,
Vader comes with miniature Star Wars figures (which are, of course, horribly
out of scale on this toy, but that's to be expected). Not just a miniature
Vader's included, though, but three miniature Stormtroopers to help control
this behemoth Mecha-- one can fit in the lower part of each leg, and one
can fit in each of the shoulder planet cockpits.

    Even if you don't like
the idea of Star Wars Transformers, I strongly recommend you give this
dude a try. It's an AWESOME toy for $50, has great articulation, proportions,
and features, and is truly a feat of engineering. He's easily the best
SWTF to date as of this writing (8/08). Just be aware of the complicated
transformation.
