    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime Beast
Hunters legion Smokescreen. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Prime Beast Hunters legion Smokescreen figure

     redeco of a Prime figure that's supposed to represent a movie-universe
character that's been onscreen? You couldn't just made a new Legion-class
mold for this mass-release? Anyways, this is Prime Smokescreen done up
as
     <a href="tlkbarricade.html">
      TLK Barricade

     -- at least at a glance.
Yes, he does have the police sirens that are painted a nice blue-and-red,
and the middle is painted off-white over the base plastic, which is a very
dark navy blue-- almost black, which makes the actual black plastic in
the tires not stand out at all, unfortunately. It's a nice basic color
scheme-- but unfortunately, the basics are really all that's here, and
that's not enough to really make this toy look like anything other than
evil
     <a href="pricyprowl.html">
      Prime Universe Prowl
     </a>
     . Where's the "POLICE"
tampos with the Decepticon symbol? Tiny "To Punish and Enslave" tampos
near the back? There IS a a silver Decepticon symbol near the front bumper,
but that's it. No headlights painted, no taillights painted, no windows
painted-- beyond the sirens, the white center, and that silver symbol,
in fact, the ONLY other paint apps on Barricade are the red on the robot
eyes. This makes all those molded-in details very difficult to make out
against the dark plastic, especially in robot mode. But then again... maybe
it's for the better, so you can't see how much this toy DOESN'T look like
Barricade in robot mode.

     Barricade has the same
siren piece added to the mold that Prime legion Prowl has, but no mold
changes have been made specifically for this release.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     If you want a Prime-aesthetic
legion class Barricade toy to face down your Prime legion-class Autobots,
this toy makes for a decent-- if very underdetailed-- "plugin" for that
line. If you want a tiny TLK Barricade, though-- at least with realistic
proportions, that's not a Tiny Turbo Changer? Well, you're outta luck.
This release just screams last-minute cheap cash-in, and is otherwise not
recommended.
