    All of the Tiny Turbo
Changers have to be "superdeformed" in their modes to fit the traditional
dimensions of the size, but WOW they really superdeformed Blackout. In
helicopter mode his cockpit is like, almost half his total volume, with
the wing-like outcroppings on the sides also being much larger than normal,
while the entire tail and rotary fin is laughably tiny and small. Despite
the cute proportions, though, Blackout has quite a lot of mold detailing
in this mode, with all the big details like the windows present, as well
as many lesser ones, like panel lines all through the figure, as well as
even tiny little cockpit door handles, a stepladder, and some side windows
molded in! Of course, this being a Tiny Turbo Changer that's really cheap,
none of these details are painted-- rather, all of Blackout in this mode
is a fairly pale powdery blue plastic that's pretty close to the color
used on his "regular" toys. The only part painted that's visible in this
mode is the rotor, which is painted black. (And no, the rotor doesn't spin,
sadly. The plastic is too soft for that anyways. Though the way it droops
is kinda fitting for this superdeformed look he's got going on.) As far
as extras, you can see his hands sticking out near the back of the sides,
but they're pretty small-- it's a pretty minor downside.

    Transforming TTT Blackout
ain't no thang. Just pull back on the bottom rear section, then flip it
around to become the robot legs and push up on that same part to lock it
into place again. The arms are already at the sides, and the body and face
are detailed on the underside of the helicopter. The proportions are largely
fairly normal for the body and arms, but his legs are a bit short proportionally
and his head quite large-- as you'd expect from a superdeformed toy. Of
course, there's most of the helicopter on Blackout's back, but with the
exception of the cockpit jutting out behind his head, it's not a big deal--
he's stable, and it's not like Blackout hasn't always had a substantial
backpack anyways. And if you thought the vehicle mode was detailed, his
robot mode is even moreso, with all the necessary details here-- the split
cockpit for the chest with faux helicopter windows on the sides, wiry-like
details on the arms, those large partially hollow-looking kneecaps, the
three-pronged feet-- everything's molded into this tiny spot, it's amazing.
The head also has all the spikes on the top and mandibles on the bottom
you'd expect, but cutes-ified a little. I mean, as much as you can get
Blackout to look "cute" with that face. He's still pretty terrifing, his
forehead and eyes are just bigger. His head is painted silver and his eyes
bloody red, but the rest of this mode is unfortunately still that unpainted
powdery blue plastic-- comes with the price point, I guess. For articulation,
Blackout can move back-and-forth at the shoulders and at the hips, though
both legs are one piece, so if you kick one leg forward the other has to
come with it.

    He's simple even for
a Tiny Turbo Changer, but Blackout is one of the better designs, with a
pretty detailed alternate mode with almost no extras, while the extras
in his robot mode are mostly just behind his head, and he's not hampered
by a bunch of kibble on his limbs. If you like the style of the TTTs, I'd
recommend this one, keeping in mind of course the limitations of the pricepoint.
