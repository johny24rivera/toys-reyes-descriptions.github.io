    Beast mode is a snow
tiger with bird wings, tailfeathers, and back feet. This mode is very nicely
detailed and large, even for an ultra. It still retains that half organic/half
metallic look to it, especially on the face. Although the middle of its
body is mostly levers and bars used for transformation, this can be overlooked,
as it does not get in the way. The "cockpit" on his upper chest looks very
nice, and the chair inside it swings a little bit. This mode has so many
points of articulation, it's incredible! Get this- even the TONGUE can
move! Another nice effect is that his talons can snap shut, and this is
good for grasping smaller Beast Wars figures. There are, however, two major
problems I have with this mode. For one, his vehicle mode mask is clearly
visible behind his head. It looks like his tiger face doesn't really have
a neck, just another face connecting it to the body trunk. Second, and
the most annoying, is the fact the if his wings are as far downward as
they can be easily, at a 180 degree angle, a lever automatically pushes
the cannons forward in his wings and fires them. Although this is a nice
effect for battle scenes, it gets really annoying when you're just moving
him around and whatnot.

    Vehicle mode is, like
every Transmetal 2 vehicle mode, poor. Basically all you do is just swing
his mask over his head and push his wings forward a bit. That's it. They
really should just call the mask a "mutant face", like in the early Beast
Wars figures, and not call it a whole different mode.

    Robot mode is wonderfully
done. Although the transformation between beast and robot may be confusing
the first few times you do it, you'll most likely get it eventually. His
spark orb is visible only during transformation, on the long transparent
green pillar inside of his body. The long transformation is worth it, though,
because not only does the robot mode look great, but has only one extra!
(not counting the wings, which are supposed to be sticking out) His face
is wonderfully detailed, and even has the green transparent visor that
Tigerhawk has on the show! Two of his missle launchers can be taken off
and used as hand-held cannons, which removes that annoying automatic fire
in this mode. Unlike the robot mode pic above, the bird talons can be fitted
into his shoulders, just like in the show, and make him look all the more
fearsome. The only problem with this mode is his tiger head and mask on
his left shoulder, which can get in the way a bit. This doesn't subtract
much from the mode, however.

    A wonderfully done transformer
in beast and robot mode, but a poorly done vehicle mode. Highly recommended.

      A puzzling new cybernetic entity, Tigerhawk
is the result of an advanced alien speciesÂ’ apprehension of the former
Tigertron and Airazor. Mysteriously combined and reconfigured, Tigerhawk
was sent back as a prophet of peace to end the long war between Maximal
and Predacon. Possesses elemental powers to summon earthquakes, electrical
storms and tsunamis. Has Vok alien-enhanced intelligence and an incredible
arsenal of weaponry including an ion diminisher that paralyzes enemies.
Totally fearless, noble and ferocious in battle, he is an inspiration to
his fellow Maximals.
