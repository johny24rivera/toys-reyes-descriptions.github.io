    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM leader
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     As is pretty obvious
if you're familiar with Bumblebee's new design for Age of Extinction, this
is NOT, in fact, his AoE body, but rather his Dark of the Moon leader class
toy, recolored slightly and released. The big downside?
     <i>
      It doesn't come
with the huge Mechtech backpack that was its main selling point in the
first place
     </i>
     , and what was largely the reason to forgive this toy's
other flaws. That aside, focusing on the color scheme itself, 'Bee hasn't
changed much-- the most obvious change is that his stripes in car mode
are now AoE-accurate, with a large single stripe down the center with a
"border" around the stripe, instead of two separate stripes like in DotM.
He's also got some nice black trim on the bottom of the sides. The yellow
plastic on him is also a bit more... yellow, with less orange in the mix--
it honestly looks a bit more plain and duller as a result. His transparent
plastic and black parts and most of the black paint is unchanged. What
is apparent in his robot mode is that there's more gray-- which, honestly,
the movie toyline did NOT need. He's got considerably more gray paint on
the faux chest piece, and much of his legs and arms are in a lighter gray
than the DotM release of this mold. On the flipside, some other bits on
his legs and arms are now in black plastic, which helps add a bit more
visual contrast there, even if it's not a lot. There's a yellow paint app
on Bumblebee's crotch, which looks odd against all the light gray around
it-- more should have been added, there. Other than that, some of his paint
apps from robot mode have actually been removed, like on his upper legs,
toes, and license plate. At least his facesculpt is still painted nicely,
though.

     Other than the removal
of the Mechtech backpack, no mold changes have been made to this version
of Bumblebee.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     AoE Leader class Bumblebee
is a VERY hard sell, even for big Bumblebee fans and completists. Why?
A. He's not AoE-accurate; B. He's more expensive than the DotM version,
but comes WITHOUT the big electronic backpack that was the big selling
point for the DotM version; and C. His plastic colors overall are less
eye-catching and more plain, with fewer paint apps. Overall it just seems
like something very little effort was put in and almost feels like it should
have been some obscure discount store exclusive and not a mainline release.
I'd skip this and get the DotM Leader class version instead, any day of
the week.

       There is a time for stealth and a time
to attack. With the Autobots abandoned, exiled, and hunted by new enemies,
it's good to have a warrior like Bumblebee around. The Autobot scout knows
when to keep quiet, and when to go on the offensive.
