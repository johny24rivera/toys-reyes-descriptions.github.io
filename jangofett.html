    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Boba Fett. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Boba Fett

     Like most Star Wars Transformers,
Jango Fett's major color is gray, so in that sense the main color is unchanged
from Boba Fett. The actual shade of gray is a much more attractive light
bluish shade of gray this time, however, compared with the dull dirty gray
of Boba Fett. Staying true to the character, Jango Fett's entire color
scheme is based on the colors blue and black, with a few paint apps of
differing colors put in here and there to break it up some, of course.
The sea blue and dark sea blue paint apps used on the rear part of the
vehicle mode and several parts of the Mech mode are of an especially attractive
shade, and go very well with the rest of the colors. There's also a decent
amount of black to break up all the lighter colors, but not too much to
take away from the general blue-ness of Jango's colors. The bits of yellow
and brown, most visible in the vehicle and Mech modes, respectively, also
accent the colors very well, and fit Jango Fett's character.

     No mold changes have
been made to Jango Fett.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Jango Fett has an awesome
color scheme that fits together very well and is hardly par-for-the-course
for the Star Wars Transformers, of which attractive colors are hardly a
defining feature of the line. As such, he's definitely better than the
duller, muddier Boba Fett toy, but the mold itself still looks pretty ugly
in Mech mode.

       A man of great skill and greater secrecy,
Jango Fett is the fastest, smartest and most dangerous bounty hunter known.
Using modified armor and new shape-shifting technology, Fett morphs into
Slave I mode and flies off to attend a secret meeting with Lord Tyranus
on Kamino. After making a shady yet lucrative deal to use his body as a
template for a clone army, Fett decides to stay on Kamino and dedicate
his time to training his newly cloned son, Boba.
