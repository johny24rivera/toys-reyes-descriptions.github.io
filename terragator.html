    Beast mode is a crocodile
with a shell on its back. This mode looks nice on the top, but doesnt
stay together very well at all, especially his shell and tail. You can
pull on his tail to make his mouth move up and down, but his tail comes
off a lot when you do this. Nice detailing and paint job, though.

    Robot mode is a very
nice mode, with few extras. The only extra is his crocodile face and head
on his right shoulder, which makes him look rather lop-sided. He has two
weapons; he has a large shell shield that can cover over half of his body,
and his crocodile tail and back feet flip out and upside down to become
a rifle. His main body is well-crafted with no extras, and his face is
extremely organic-looking.

    A nice robot, although
he doesnt stay together well in beast mode.

      Most Transformers find that smelly,
mucky environments clog up their circuitry. Not the half-croc, half-turtle
Terragator. He prefers it. Terragator is most at home in the swamp lands
and sewers. Part of the Predacon elite amphibious warriors, his specialty
is land/water assault. In robot mode he wields an impenetrable shield,
and his hand reveals an awesome weapon.
