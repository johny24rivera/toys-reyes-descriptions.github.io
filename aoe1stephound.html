    Hound's military transport
is replicated fairly accurately here, with one major section-- the back
section-- just... rather abruptly ending a bit before it actually should,
with the robot hands and feet VERY obviously sticking out the back end.
I'm not sure why they couldn't have just extended the back top section
a bit more, over the hands-- I would've gladly traded a bit of kibble on
the back of the hands for an alt mode that looked much more solid simply
with that one change. From a direct-on side view, you can see the upper
legs below the main bulk of the vehicle, but that's not nearly as big of
a deal, especially when you consider the whole "one-step changer" gimmick.
The colors in this mode are somewhat accurate, at least in terms of the
plastic, with most being a dark military green, accented by some dull grayish
brown. Not exactly the most eye-catching color scheme, but it's realistic.
The tires, are, appropriately, black, but nothing else is in this mode.
What's rather disappointing is the severe lack of paint apps in this mode.
The front windows are pained silver, along with some small side bars, and
the exhaust pipe is painted a rather nice shade of metallic gunmetal gray.
The OSHKOSH symbol is also present on the front of the truck, teeny-tiny
as it is. The rest of this mode is unpainted, which is a real shame-- the
top of this mode may not have much mold detailing, but the sides (especially
at the front section) certainly do, with details like grated windows, headlights,
and various bars on the front just begging for some paint.

    Hound transforms in
almost exactly the same way as
    <a href="aoe1stepprime.html">
     1-step changer
Optimus Prime
    </a>
    does (which partially explains the weak back end to the
vehicle mode)-- pressing in on the round section at the top of the vehicle
mode and unlocking the legs allows him to unfold into his robot mode. Said
robot mode looks pretty good, particularly when compared to the vehicle
mode. The proportions are only a little off-- the legs are a bit skinny,
and Hound's a bit barrel-chested without any sort of gut-- but largely
easily overlooked for a one-step changer. There is some kibble-- the halves
of his roof behind his shoulders, and the front of the vehicle behind his
main body, but both of these stay out of the way and only the former really
affects the silhouette of the robot mode at all, and even then in only
a minor manner. The mold detailing on Hound's robot parts is exquisite.
From all the little armor plating and pipe details on his body (and even
his dog tags!) to his wheel-feet to it looking like his arms themselves
are made of out of ammo belts and missiles to a face sculpt is that is
pretty spot-on (slightly shortened beard aside), it all looks pretty impressive,
particularly for the size. The paint is, thankfully, applied a bit more
liberally here, with the metallic gunmetal gray on the lower arms and metallic
bronze on the upper arms coming off particularly nicely against the dark
green. The wheel-feet are appropriately painted black, and Hound has a
silver face, black beard, and the usual Autobot-blue optics. That said--
particularly given all the mold detailing there-- his chest could still
definitely use some paint detailing, and is the one big oversight regarding
this aspect of the robot mode. For articulation, Hound can move at the
neck and back-and-forth at the shoulders, but that's it. Not impressive,
but then again, articulation isn't the point of these figures, given the
aimed age range. Some elbow articulation couldn't have hurt even given
his transformation, though.

    Back end of the vehicle
mode aside, Hound looks pretty nice for a one-step changer, with a largely
proportional (though vastly underpainted) vehicle mode and a remarkably
solid-looking, well-done robot mode with relatively minimal kibble. Again,
he doesn't have much articulation, but that's the case with the rest of
the toys in this subline. Still, despite being rather good for the subline,
this is my least-recommended mold if you want an AoE Hound, given how good
