    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Patrol Bumblebee's color
scheme makes him look more like a police car, which honestly is more fitting
given he scanned Captain Fanzone's car for an alternate mode in the cartoon.
The white-and-black color scheme, while pretty basic, looks fairly good
in vehicle mode, as there's a good amount of black stripes and paint apps
to break up all the white, it all looks very "police-y". (The windows are
actually paintd a very dark grayish blue, but for all intents and purposes
it looks more or less black.) The "PATROL" words on the sides are appropriate
for the vehicle mode, and I do like the black-painted front with the pale
yellow headlights, they really look nicely together. However, I do have
a major complaint with Patrol Bumblebee's color scheme, and it's mostly
apparent in his robot mode-- much of his "inner robot" parts remain the
same yellow they've always been, and the yellow just is not a good color
to use against the white, there's not nearly enough contrast. It just ends
up not only looking a little clashy, but a bit lazy since the previous
usage of Bumblebee already had this same shade of yellow on the same robot
parts. In vehicle mode, at least, the yellow is much less apparent, only
showing on the hinges behind his rear tires.

     Patrol Bumblebee is
an interesting idea-- making Bumblebee's emergency-themed alternate mode
more police-like-- but the white just does NOT go with the yellow. If you're
going to get an Activator Bumblebee, stick with the original.

       Bumblebee specializes in speed! With
the help of his teammate Prowl, however, he's learning important lessons
about stealth as well. With his new skills he's got the choice of racing
headlong into trouble, or sneaking up from behind.
