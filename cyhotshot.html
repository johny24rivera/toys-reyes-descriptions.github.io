    Hot Shot's vehicle mode
is a futuristic sportscar, just like it's always been. Hot Shot looks even
sleeker than he did in his previous versions-- which is expected, of course,
now that he's on the Speed Planet. And his vehicle mode looks hecka cool
because of it-- heck, even the windshield looks like it's being swept back
some by Hot Shot's super-speed! His mold detailing is somewhat sparse,
but I suppose that's to keep with his steamlined look. He does have a few
cool details, though, like air vents on the front hood and little drivers'
seats molded inside. Plug in his Cyber Key and two little wings pop out
of his sides to give him a bit of a sub-flight mode, plus they also make
him look a bit speedier, too. It's not super-impressive, but it is kinda
cool. He also has a gun (mounted on his hood in this mode) that is your
standard spring missile launcher. I am not fond of Hot Shot's new color
scheme, however-- sky blue is just too "calm" of a color for a mile-a-minute
guy like Hot Shot, and it just doesn't fit his character, especially after
I've gotten so used to seeing him being primarily yellow. I'm not normally
a big proponent of using a lot of yellow on Transformers, but the duller
yellow used on
    <a href="enhotshot.html">
     Energon Hot Shot
    </a>
    looked just
fine, and yellow just fit him a bit more than this sky blue. Hot Shot does
have some yellow still left on him-- in a triangular-shaped pattern but
it clashes a little with the blue. The transparent amber, bluish-black,
and red go just fine with him, however. Another minor complaint I have
is that you can't open the side doors or anything like that, because of
his transformation-- granted, it's not a realistic car, but I still like
little details like that. But still, this is a really stellar alt mode.

    Not only is Hot Shot's
robot mode also fantastic, but it's also a pretty major nod to
    <a href="rodimusmajor.html">
     G1
Hot Rod
    </a>
    in almost everything but the color scheme. The transformation
is almost identical, not to mention he's also got those three "exhaust
pipe"-like extensions on the back of his hands and the Hot Rod-like fin
extensions on his backside if you insert his Cyber Key. I also like the
way the windshield/drivers' seat section hangs off his rear like some kind
of medieval armor skirt. He still definite has some Hot Shot-esque features,
though; his head has the familiar "racing helmet"-like visor, and he's
got the big shoulders like
    <a href="arhotshot.html">
     Armada Hot Shot
    </a>
    .
His articulation isn't spectacular, but it's still pretty good; he can
move at the head, the shoulders (at two points), the elbows, the hips,
and the knees. I'm not too crazy about his arms, however; they're too skinny
proportionally, and his elbows are too far down, to the point where his
fists make up about half of his "lower arms". The wheels on the middle
of his arms keep him from pointing his gun straight forward. But that's
my only complaint except for the aforementioned color scheme; otherwise,
he's got great proportions and great detailing.

    Hot Shot is an awesome
toy all around, with few downsides. He got stiffed on his color scheme,
and his arms are a bit wiggy in robot mode, but in all other areas he's
a solid toy. Highly recommended.

      A natural leader with a lot yet to learn, Hot Shot often races straight
into danger at top speed. He takes great pride in the fact that he's the
fastest Autobot there is, but it isn't until he gets to the Speed Planet
that he learns the true meaning of velocity. Faced by the almost unbeatable
Override, Hot Shot needs to learn a whole new way of thinking about acceleration
before he can win the Great Race.
