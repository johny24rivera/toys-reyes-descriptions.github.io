first used for the Transmetal 2 version of Beast Wars Megatron, back in
1999.

not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Megatron Transmetal 2.

     Cryotek is, as mentioned
above, a Target Exclusive. You can only purchase him at the Target retail
store chain or at a few select online stores. Cryotek is pretty much the
polar opposite of Megatron Transmetal 2 (no pun intended); while Megatron
Transmetal 2 is a fire-breathing dragon, and pretty much embodies the element
of fire, Cryotek is an ice dragon, embodying the element of ice. And I
liiike. The dark blue and sea foam green-blue work well together. The transparent
ice blue plastic looks especially neat, adding all the more to the "ice"
feel. The transmetal purple is also a nice touch, since it's a different
color than its surroundings, unlike Megatron TM2's plastic, which was almost
entirely red and black. The gray used for the robot face, however, appears
a bit out of place, although it doesn't really clash with the rest of the
color scheme. It just isn't used anywhere else on the body, which is rather
odd. Unlike
     <a href="skybyte.html">

     , Cryotek's paint detailing
isn't enhanced any more than Megatron Transmetal 2's, unfortunately.

     There were no mold changes
made to Megatron Transmetal 2 when they reused the mold for Cryotek, so
the ice dragon retains all the flaws and features mold-wise that its predecessor
did.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Cryotek and Megatron
Transmetal 2 are very close, both mold-wise and color-wise. However, I'm
going to have to recommend Cryotek slightly over his predecessor, since
the transmetal plastic is a different color than its surrounding plastic,
allowing for a bit more diversity color-wise.

       Cryotek is one of the most deadly and
mysterious figures in the history of Cybertron's criminal underworld. Though
he was once considered one of the planet's most gifted engineers, Cryotek
became increasingly dissatisfied with the actions of the Predacon ruling
class - leaders who he felt had too quickly abandoned the classical Decepticon
philosophies of conquest and deceit. Relying on the more illicit opportunities
available to a being of his considerable skills and intellect, Cryotek
eventually became one of the most dangerous outlaws on Cybertron - one
more than willing to apply his scientific talents to the less-than-noble
pursuits of extortion, theft, and criminal mayhem. Cryotek's logical mind
and pragmatic bent have made him an extremely successful gangster, one
who approaches each new "business venture" with the discipline of a trained
researcher. Nevertheless, Cryotek does find the time to take great pleasure
in his work.

       (NOTE: On the models released of Cryotek, there is something wrong with
the neck lever. To fix this, get a screwdriver. Loosen the screw in the
neck lever, turn the lever 180 degrees, then tighten it again. This should
fix the problem.)
