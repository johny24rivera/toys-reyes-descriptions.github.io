    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Blurr w/
Hyperdrive. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titans
Return Blurr w/ Hyperdrive

     Brainstorm's Titan Master
is Teslor, and being that this is a remold of Blurr, Teslor's robot mode
is identical in terms of sculpt when compared to Blurr's Titan Master Hyperdrive.
Color-wise he's got some seafoam green used on his head and appendages
and some off-white used on his main body. The head has a bit of orange
paint on it, but this mode is otherwise barren of the stuff. The orange
honestly looks a little garish right against the seafoam green, but the
green and off-white go together fairly well, being a somewhat loud color
with a calm color. In head mode Teslor has one of the mold changes made
to this toy-- a new face for Brainstorm. The headsculpt is very IDW-esque
Brainstorm, with a generally slimmer, sleeker look. He's got a ridged off-white
forehead surrounded by a couple of segments on his head, an orange faceplate,
and small blue eyes hidden way back there-- I honestly think the eyes are
a titch too small. Otherwise it's a great new headsculpt, though.

     As for Brainstorm himself,
his color scheme is made up of three main colors; seafoam green, off-white,
and a somewhat ugly brownish gray. I'm not sure what's up with Hasbro using
this last color so often lately-- either make the plastic brown or make
it gray, having it in-between just looks a bit ugly to me. Still, it does
complement the off-white fairly well. The seafoam green gives a nice "central
color" for the others to frame-- particularly in robot mode-- and given
that it's not used as often as on Teslor, it looks pretty good. In fact,
I wish it was used a bit more-- on the legs in particular, as that much
unbroken off-white doesn't look that great. In vehicle mode Brainstorm
is VERY much in need of paint apps-- except for the seafoam green paint
surrounding the yellow-orange translucent cockpit (which looks pretty darned
good against said green, by the way) and some Autobot insiginias on the
wings, there are NO paint apps in vehicle mode. No rear window paint apps,
no paint apps on the wings or front nosecone-- nothin', and it makes the
vehicle mode look pretty dull. At least in robot mode there's some nice
details on the wings and lower legs that replicate some of his G1 stickers,
with a mix of silver, red, and yellow. They really help to add some variety
there, but there's still some paint apps that need to be added elsewhere--
there's just too much unbroken off-white and brownish gray on this toy.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Brainstorm has several
mold changes-- beyond the aforementioned new face, there's a new nosecone
piece that replicates Brainstorm's twin-gun setup, wings on the sides of
the vehicle mode/shoulders, smaller aesthetic wings on the front of Brainstorm's
robot mode shoulders, a wing that comes up out of the main body of the
vehicle mode, and the small pieces that fold over the front of the lower
arms for vehicle mode. Taken by themselves I like the mold changes-- they're
pretty solidly sculpted (though the new nosecone is a a bit thick towards
the back end), but it just doesn't make the vehicle mode look enough like
a jet. It still looks too much like Blurr with too-small wings and a different
front. In robot mode everything looks pretty good together, though.

     Titans Return Brainstorm
has a great base mold, but as far as remolding Blurr into him... it works
pretty decently in robot mode, and Brainstorm has some nice paint apps
there, but in vehicle mode Brainstorm just looks poor. Not enough paint,
the body is far too large for a jet and the wings are far too small, making
this definitely an inferior version of the mold compared to... well, any
other version of it. The color scheme is generally okay, though I wish
the seafoam green wasn't quite as loud and the brownish gray was more brown.
I'd stick to
     <a href="genbrainstorm.html">
      "Thrilling 30" Brainstorm

     instead if I were you, unless it's that big of a issue for all the Titan/Headmasters
in your collection to be cross-compatible.
