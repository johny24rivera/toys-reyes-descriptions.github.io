not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Although the rest of
the "G1-ish" Dinobots got a G1-themed redeco in an
     <a href="aoeg1dinobots.html">
      SDCC
exclusive boxset
     </a>
     , poor ol' Slog was left out, so this was rectified
by this Amazon-exclusive single-pack, which came in the exact same packaging
as mass-retail Slog, oddly. Anyways, like with his SDCC-exclusive-- and
similarly premium-priced-- brethren, Hasbro went pretty much all-out on
the G1 redeco. This isn't just a bit of silver and gold paint, folks; for
starters, there's LOADS of silver chrome on Slog-- his shoulders, feet,
rear lower legs, stomach, and sides of the tail are all chrome, along with
parts of his waist. Additionally, as of this writing (12/17) it hasn't
even shown a hint of chipping, so it seems to be bonded pretty well. Now,
if Slog were ALL silver chrome-- or close to it-- this might get a bit
gaudy, but thankfully that's not the case. Most of the other gray plastic
on Slog has been coated in a silver paint-- a nice "in-between" the chrome
and regular plastic in terms of brightness. The only places unpainted gray
plastic is used are on some bendy parts that tend to bend a lot during
transformation, where obviously it would be a problem to cover them in
paint-- namely, the top tail/robot "skirt" piece and the lower front part
of Slog's dino neck. There's also a touch of pearly light gray plastic,
but it's only used for a few small connector pieces. He's got some nice
gold paint-covered parts on his robot feet and chest, but what's especially
cool is that his upper dino neck and head are clear plastic, but then are
painted gold on only the inner side of the plastic-- this gives the part
a very unique feel, much like the G1 toy that had clear plastic on the
outside but gold chrome on the inside. It's a VERY nicely done effect,
and something I didn't expect for the premium price. The dark blue eyes
also contrast with the gold extremely well. The black and red plastic bits
on this version of Slog are the same color-- and largely have the same
placement-- as on the mass-release version of this toy, though much of
red paint has been removed (there are a few red paint apps on the ends
of the tail and-- most notably-- on parts of the robot chest). The parts
where the red and gold paint meet on the chest are the only portions of
Slog's color scheme I feel don't look all that great-- together they're
a bit too light, without silver or black paint to help break up those colors.
Although they still look nice, I also wish Slog's guns weren't the same
red as on the mass release version-- I would've preferred gold guns to
differentiate things a little more.

     The "G1 Redeco" of Slog
looks fantastic, with loads of gold and silver paint and a good amount
of silver chrome that looks great without going "overboard" on the shininess.
The black helps break up all the shiny a bit as well, and the clear/plastic
combo on the dino neck and head looks utterly stupendous. The few places
where the red and gold paint directly meet are my only real complaints
about the color scheme-- if you're up for the premium price, I'd definitely
recommend this over any other versions of this toy, easily.

       Slog is low on brainpower, even by Dinobot
standards. He's slow, lumbering, and absolutely gigantic. When you're that
big, most problems get stamped out pretty quickly, sometimes before you
even know they're there. But what Slog lacks in brains he makes up for
in brawn. Anything he tramples snaps under his massive feet. The Dinobots
know that he can clear a path through any enemy line... as long as they
point him in the right direction first.

      *A "Platinum Edition" of the G1-colored AoE Dinobots-- all of those
in the SDCC exclusive boxset [the toys only, no Ark] as well as Slog, this
time-- was released as an online retail exclusive in 2015. This release
of Slog is identical to the Amazon exclusive version described above except
for one detail-- namely, the robot headsculpt has been changed to look
much like G1 Sludge's, though with a bit spikier of a headcrest. It's an
okay sculpt, but I don't think the G1 head really fits the movieverse body,
so I recommend the Amazon exclusive version over the Platinum Edition version.
