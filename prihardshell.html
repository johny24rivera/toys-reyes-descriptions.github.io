    Hardshell's beast mode
is a somewhat alien-looking insect. I say this because he's got most of
the features of an insect--like, say, a stag beetle--but the large "horn"
at the front isn't quite right, and all of his detailing is considerably
more pointy, with a slightly techno-organic vibe (but one that's not too
detailed, in fitting with the Prime aesthetic). He's also got some yellow
spikes (that become his robot shoulders) behind his head which certainly
aren't there on any Earth insect I know of. Most importantly, he's got
a rather fearsome-looking, four-eyed insect face below his large horn (which
actually isn't all the visible from most angles because of the front legs).
I really love this alien-looking face-- and yes, his large jaw can in fact
open quite wide and close back up, which is a joy to see on a toy in the
Cyberverse size classes. (For his other articulation in this mode, Hardshell
can move at the base of each wing, at the base of his four front insect
legs [all as one piece; primarily due to his transformation], and at three
points along each of his rear legs. As far as blatant robot extras, Hardshell's
surprisingly pretty free of those-- his shoulder spikes fit in pretty well
with his overall look in this mode, and his robot feet can be seen at the
bottom of his rear, but just barely. The only blatant ones are his back
insect legs, which due to their comparative size and detailing are pretty
clearly his robot arms. Hardshell's color scheme is rather earthy and grounded,
and generally pretty realistic colors for an insect, being mostly shades
of dull green and gray with a pearlescent gray used for a light contrast
color. That said, the pearlescent gray just looks a bit TOO light and milky
to realistically pass as wings; I would have preferred a more transparent
and/or light blue coloration there. The bits of silver and dull yellow
serve as decent accent colors, and the light red used on his insect and
robot eyes really pops. It's certainly not a bad color scheme by any means,
but overall it's not really eye-catching either. Hardshell also has a weapon--
a basic push-missile launcher-- that fits in between his wings in this
mode. It does its job well enough, but isn't anything spectacular. It can
also be held in either of his hands or mounted on either of his lower arms
in robot mode.

    Hardshell's transformation
isn't complex, but a couple of the steps don't quite go how you'd think,
and he does have a few more steps than your average Commander class toy.
The end result is a robot mode that looks admirably different from his
beast mode, while of course still retaining some important aspects from
it like the spikiness and the wings. I love the powerful and hunched-over
look of his headsculpt and shoulders, with a relatively small visored,
fanged face at the end of his long neck-- along with his "chicken walker"
legs, it makes him look both buff and beastly, and gives him a lot of character.
My only real issue here is that Hardshell's insect mode kibble can get
in the way a bit, particularly around the midsection, and most of it is
just unsightly-- the four insect legs just hanging off his lower back and
the wings hanging next to his legs just don't look good. (At least the
insect head folds behind his back pretty well.) Hardshell's color scheme
gets a bit more yellow in this mode and looks a bit more differentiated
and interesting as a result, and more carapace-like mold detailing is everywhere,
emphasizing that this is an insect-former (as if the extra legs and wings
didn't make it obvious enough). For articulation, Hardshell can move at
the shoulders (at three points, with two of those being his shoulder "spike"
armor pads), elbows, hips, knees (at two points), and ankles. Most of these
are ball socket joints, so he has a pretty decent range of motion, with
only rotation at his knees and head movement being obvious points that
don't move on this toy. Given his ball-jointed ankles, he's fairly stable,
but he's also back-heavy, so he can't get into quite as many poses as you'd
think from that description of his articulation.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Hardshell does have
a few minor issues-- namely his insect kibble coming off his lower back
in robot mode-- but overall he's a solid toy with an intuitive transformation
and is a very unique design even among the more beastly Beast Hunters toys.
One of my favorite Commander-class toys of the Prime line-- a solid recommendation
if you're at all into animal TFs.
