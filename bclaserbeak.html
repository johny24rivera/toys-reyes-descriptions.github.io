    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Divebomb. For a

     Laserbeak is supposed
to be the same character as the
     <a href="g1soundwave.html">
      G1 bird-tape
     </a>
     ,
and was upgraded into a Predacon form like Ravage in the Beast Wars TV
show. However, unlike Ravage, he's shedded his tape mode entirely and now
transforms from robot to hawk. The color scheme has some similiarites with
his partner Buzzsaw, including the transparent purple weapons, black legs
and some feathers, and the light gray paint apps on his wings, bird neck,
and robot chest. However, there's certainly more than enough color changes
to still differentiate between him and Buzzsaw, the main one being that
his main color is a fiery orangish-red. It's a pretty nice color to use,
in my opinion, and makes him look rather Phoenix-ish. The gold paint apps
on the wings and beak help to add to this look, and altogether the colors
go together quite nicely, the only exception being the transparent purple,
which goes together a little better on his darker-colored partner Buzzsaw.
There's also a few other minor paint app changes such as on the robot chest
to help differentiate Laserbeak from his pack-in buddy even more, though
all of the paint app locations on Laserbeak are the same as on Buzzsaw.
My only real outright complaint with the colors is that, though they look
cool, there aren't "Laserbeakish" enough. G1 Laserbeak had a more "normal"
red color instead of a fiery orangish-red, and he also had way more black.
Thus, although some were able to see it in the leaked toy pics before it
was officially announced, the fact that it wasn't anywhere near a consensus
does show that it does take a bit of extrapolation to see Laserbeak in
this mode, though not as much stretching as it does for Buzzsaw, granted.
A Predacon symbol has been painted over the molded-in Decepticon spark
crystal to fit the toy in with the story without any remolding.

     No mold changes have
been made to Laserbeak when compared to Energon Divebomb. Also of note
is that in addition to being a Botcon 2006 exclusive, you could only buy
Laserbeak for $45 with Buzzsaw at the convention-- it was not available
free to preregistrants or available at all to those who did not attend
the convention. Laserbeak is limited to 500 pieces, so he's worth a pretty
penny.

     Laserbeak is a nice
redeco of a nice mold, and I don't really have any problems with his color
scheme except that it's not quite as G1-accurate as it should have been.
Still, it is quite expensive, and is obviously only meant for the big-time
Transformers toy collector.

       After the Great War, most Decepticons
who were granted amnesty simply retired, no longer wanting any part of
the age old conflict. Laserbeak, not satisfied with the idea of wasting
away on the outskirts of Cybertron, found a new calling when he was contacted
by Divebomb, a Predacon that was long thought deactivated. Offering both
a new form and a new purpose, Laserbeak, along with Ravage and Buzzsaw,
accepted the offer and was reprogrammed and rebuilt as a Predacon. Though
Ravage became dissatisfied with his role and left to serve the Tri-Predacus
Council, Laserbeak, like Buzzsaw, stayed loyal to his benefactor. In beast
mode, Laserbeak can travel up to 400 mph. His twin crystal blades can slice
through 5 inch thick plate steel with relative ease. While more comfortable
in beast mode, Laserbeak has become quite adept at piloting different starships
through space. With his comrade, Buzzsaw, Laserbeak continues to work in
secret towards bringing about the day when the strong elements within the
Predacon population will rise up and seize power away from those who have
made peace, not war.
