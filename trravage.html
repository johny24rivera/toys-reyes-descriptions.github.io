    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Autobot Stripes.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titans Return Stripes

     C'mon, you knew this
one was coming after they released
     <i>
      Stripes
     </i>
     , of all the cassette
minions. As you'd expect, Ravage's main colors are black and a light gray--
unfortunately, it's that really bland milky shade of light gray, which
just doesn't look interesting at all. To make this rather bland color scheme
look good, you need a lot of silver paint-- and Ravage doesn't really have
much. He has some, granted-- on both sides of the shoulders of the beast
mode, on the neck, and oddly on the middle bit on the bottom end of the
smartphone mode. (This last looks rather odd, as the silver paint in the
middle clashes VERY sharply with the light gray plastic on the sides of
it. Granted, I understand why it was used-- the piece itself is casted
in black plastic, so leaving it black would've looked even weirder-- but
really, they just should've made the gray plastic on either side of it
silver, too.) However, this bit of silver isn't nearly enough to save Ravage's
incredibly boring color scheme-- he NEEDED pretty much any piece of light
milky gray not done in unpaintable plastic to be painted, or at least had
his color scheme spiced up with a few other accent colors. As far as paint,
the only other paint color is a bit of pale yellow, used to good effect
on his eyes and on the windows of his plane mode. Thankfully, at least
in smartphone mode he still looks pretty decent, due to the stickers used
for his "screen". There's some usual smartphone icons along the bottom
of the screen, such as "Home" and "Power" button icons, as well as a "Cancel"
icon-- but the more interesting part of the stickers is what's on the main
portion of the "screen", which includes what looks like a radar/sonar section,
a topographical map of the nearby area, and current sound levels. It's
exactly what Ravage WOULD be focusing on, given his usual use as a saboteur/undercover
scout, and the nice range of colors on the stickers-- purple, blue, yellow,
pink-- all help lighten up the mode and make it more visually interesting.

     Ravage has a new headsculpt,
which is much more in line with his traditional G1 look, with a much smoother,
more mechanical look than Stripes' edgy/semi-feral look. It's very well-done,
so no problems here. Other than the headsculpt, though, no mold changes
have been made to Ravage.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Titans Return Ravage
is pretty much a gimme given the existence of both Stripes AND Soundwave
in the line, but this being pretty much the worst Titans Return Legends
toy-- along with adding a boring black/gray color scheme to the mix-- makes
this my least favorite Legends toy in the entire line. The smartphone stickers
look pretty interesting, and his headsculpt is pretty spot-on, but those
are largely the only positive things I have to say about this toy compared
to Stripes. Only recommended for Ravage/Soundwave minion completionists.
