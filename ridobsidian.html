    Mold History

   : Obsidian's mold was
originally used for the

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Obsidian.

     Just like his previous
Beast Machines toy of the same name and mold, Robots in Disguise Obsidian
has NO BLACK on him whatsoever. *sigh* Well, anyway, the misused name aside,
Obsidian has an alright "desert-camoflauge" color scheme to him this time
around. The brown patches on tan are nice, and make him almost look like
a cow (Some people have even called him Moobsidian. Heh.). However, a realistic
desert camoflauge color scheme just doesn't fit that well on a futurisitc,
meched-up helicopter. Again, a darker, blacker color scheme would have
been more fitting for ol' Obsidian. The gray plastic is also a bit boring
without any paint detailing, as well- a little yellow or something would
have made it stand out a bit more. Worth noting is that, instead of the
Vehicon spark crystal he had before, RiD Obsidian now has a dark transparent
purple orb. If you look very carefully, though, you can stil see the Vehicon
symbol etched into the back of the crystal. This is rather lazy, since
Obsidian is labeled on the package as a Decepticon, yet he has no Decepticon
insignia, only a Vehicon one. Still, Hasbro admitted that this mold was
rushed a bit into production to fill out the end of the line. I still would
have preferred a Decep insignia, though.

     No changes have been
made to RiD Obsidian from his previous incarnation mold-wise, so he retains
all the features and flaws of his predecessor there.

     Although the mold is
pretty nice, RiD Obsidian's new, desert-camo color scheme doesn't fit the
futuristic helicopter that well. Although the original one still didn't
have any black on him, I'd recommend that version a little over this one.
However, this version IS $2 cheaper, so that's a definite plus...
