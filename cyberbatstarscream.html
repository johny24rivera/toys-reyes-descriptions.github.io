    For his "Cyber
Battalion" release, Starscream shares the typical F-22-esque alt mode with
just enough differences to keep him from getting into licensing issues.
Although the mold is clearly different and not merely upsized, the overall
design and engineering of this toy is clearly taken from
    <a href="genlegstarscream.html">
     "Thilling
30" Legends Starscream
    </a>
    , so he has a lot of the same pluses and minuses.
The minuses are that there are some pretty darned obvious kibble bits in
this mode-- his robot arms in particular, which do fold down enough where
most of them is hidden under the wings from a relatively top-down view
(though not at all if you look at him head-on), but even then the robot
fists stick out quite blatantly from behind said wings. The feet are also
pretty obvious on the back end of this mode, and the robot chest does stick
down just a TAD further than I'd like, though this last downside is being
rather nitpicky. Starscream's proportions are generally pretty solid on
this toy-- the wings could stand to be a SMIDGE bigger, but it's nothing
huge. The mold detailing is a bit more involved in this mode than I'd expect
from a Cyber Battalion toy, with plenty of lines along the wings, as well
as panel lines along the intakes, the nosecone, and the tailwings. The
main plastic color for the toy, unfortunately, is that really boring shade
of light milky gray, but there's enough paint and other colors in this
mode to still make Starscream look interesting. The red plastic used on
the toy is a rather nice semi-metallic swirly shade, and goes great with
all the other colors. The light sky blue on the tailfins, the stripes on
the wings, and the nosecone tip is a few shades lighter than I'd have liked,
but it still goes great with the darker colors. Speaking of darker colors,
there's also a fair amount of charcoal black used on the (removable) guns
underneath Starscream's wings and between the rear thrusters and the main
body of the jet. The extra black paint on the vents is also much appreciated,
too. The nosecone is my favorite part of this mode when it comes to colors,
though-- the entire thing's covered in silver paint, which looks quite
nice, and the metallic pumpkin orange both contrasts against the other
colors and complements the red nicely. Starscream does have a flip-out
landing gear underneath his cockpit, but the rear landing gear are merely
molded on the underside, due to how low the back end sits.

    Again, because of the
engineering Starscream has a nigh-identical transformation compared to
the aforementioned "Thrilling 30" Starscream, and the end result is very
much a G1 Starscream-y design, but a bit more angular. The wings aren't
as "soft" as on the aforementioned smaller toy, the shoulders are squares,
and the angles on his feet and hips are fairly severe, as well. Overall
it's a nice slight change for the Air Commander, and helps to differentiate
him at least a little bit from his many other G1-esque toys. His proportions
are very solid in this mode, so absolutely no issues there. The mold detailing
is also great, with many robotic details and lines along his arms and legs,
and his headsculpt in particular looking like it's taking just a HINT from
the movieverse and adding in a bit more detailing around the cheeks and
sides of the head. The color scheme stays pretty varied, with some silver
paint on Screamer's upper legs as well. As for articulation, this is where
Starscream falls a little flat, even in comparison to his smaller "Thrilling
30" counterpart; he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows,
and hips (at two points). I understand the whole "simplification" schtick
to the Cyber Battalion line, but there's no real reason he couldn't have
had knee movement or better elbow movement. His tailfins also stick out
really obviously from the sides of his lower legs, and can't fold back
at all. On the plus side, though, his main wings CAN fold back a bit at
one point on each wing, allowing Starscream to have a slighly more "aerodynamic"
look. His gun accessories can either peg into his upper shoulders or he
can hold them like normal weapons in his hands.

    Cyber Battalion Starscream
is one of the better molds from the line, though he still has his flaws,
like a lack of knees in robot mode and some obvious extras in jet mode.
His amount of paint detailing is great, though, and the mold detailing
is certainly above-average for the line. It's unfortunate that-- as far
as the U.S. goes-- he was only released in limited quantities at Universal
Studios'

    stores, at a cost that definitely
makes him prohibitive. Unless you're a Starscream completist, I'd get the
"Thrilling 30" version of him or one of the many other G1-esque versions
of him that's at a cheaper price.
