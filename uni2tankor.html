    Tankor here is a triple-changer,
and meant to be an updated version of Octane, who was also a triple-changer
with similar alternate modes. However, for whatever reason Hasbro couldn't
secure the name Octane, so Tankor it is. Tankor's first vehicle mode is
a cargo plane, and it's very impressive, particularly for a triple-changer.
The proportions are very good for the most part, though the main wings
are a tad small (though it looks much worse in pics, for some reason).
The tail fin is also a little undersized, as well, and a bit of the tanker
truck front bits show through on the back end of this mode if you look
at this mode from the back end. Tankor has four spinning miniature propellers,
which is quite impressive for this scale, and he has two guns which are
stored on the undersides of the main wings in this mode. Tankor also has
a long gray piece that attaches to the underside of this mode and provides
this mode with three miniature wheels to roll along on a flat surface.
It becomes his "claw weapon" in robot mode, though it's ever-so-slightly
wider than the main body. Still, overall the lack of extra parts from other
modes is very impressive, and Tankor's mold detailing is excellent-- panels
and the like are visible everywhere on his chassis. Tankor's color scheme
is also straight off of his G1 toy. The off-white and black don't do much
for me, though the few bits of purple and dark blue give this otherwise
monochromatic toy a bit of a color "kick". It's still a fairly dull scheme
overall, however, though at least it's not loud.

    Tankor's tanker truck
mode is the weaker of his two vehicle modes, but not by much-- it's still
quite good. The proportions are quite good and fairly realistic, though
the front with its swept-back windows looks oddly futuristic for a Universe
2.0 toy. It's not the most solid of modes-- from the back end, you can
see into the rear of the vehicle mode quite a bit, and some parts of the
side don't have truck detailing on them so much as they're Tankor's various
other parts folded into a truck-like shape to fill out his sides. The plane
propellers also are on the bottom side of this mode, near the front. Normally
this wouldn't be a bad thing, but considering how close they are to touching
the ground and what delicate little pieces of plastic they are, I worry
about them popping off or snapping when you drive Tankor along a surface
that may have an ever-so-slight bump in it, for example. What largely makes
this mode work, however, is the claw-weapon slapped on top, which hides
any Tankor's various other vehicle parts from being seen. It may be a bit
of a "cheat", perse, but it works quite well. Tankor's two guns peg onto
the back end of this mode, which also helps to keep his molded-in robot
hands on the side from being so obvious.

    For almost every Transformer
triple-changer, there's one mode that really suffers, and for Tankor, his
robot mode is it. There are a few good things about it-- the chest/waist
design is very well done, and the head design is molded excellently. The
added purple on the arms and head also spices up the color scheme a bit,
and Tankor's legs are decent for the most part. However, his arm design
is simply atrocious-- they attach to his body in a very odd manner, and
the long/high shoulders look odd compared to the relatively small, skinny
lower arms. There's also just a small plastic bit attached to one of the
wheels on each shoulder that his lower arm connects to, so he has practically
no upper arms to speak of-- just his shoulders and lower arms. His hands
are also oddly shaped, though they can still hold Tankor's two guns and
claw weapon well enough. I'm also not fond of how Tankor's wings just hang
off of his back without really locking into place anywhere. Some Transformers
can pull off this look, but not the oddly-proportioned Tankor. In addition,
the wings pop off a bit easily during transformation, which can be a bit
annoying. Tankor's feet are also rather poor, consisting of just the front
parts of the tanker truck but with little panels flipped out on the front
side. They barely look like feet at all, and his lower legs are much larger
and longer than his upper legs proportionally. As for his articulation,
Tankor can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, wrists,
hips (at two points), and knees. It's not extraordinary articulation--
and his claw weapon can weigh down his ball-jointed arms-- but it's decent.
His odd proportions get in the way of good poses more than anything else.

    Most triple-changers
have one vehicle mode that looks really bad, and to Tankor's credit, he's
not one of those triple-changers. However, instead his robot mode has gotten
the short end of the stick, particularly his arms, which are just some
of the worst arms I've ever seen on a modern Transformer. If he only had
two modes, he'd get a considerbly worse score, but I'm cutting him some
slack since he's a triple-changer, which is always difficult to pull off.
If you like the multi-changers, I'd mildly recommend Tankor, but if you're
in it for cool robot modes, you might want to pass this guy up.

      Other Decepticons would call Tankor
a dirtbag, if it wasn't for the high-octane fuel he supplies to them. He's
a sleazy liar who will steal or manipulate anyone, so long as it helps
him get his way. As such, he fits right into the most dangerous battlegrounds
across the universe, where survival depends on maintaining an advantage.
The only reason other Decepticons will have anything to do with him is
that he always seems to have a supply of fuel when everyone else is tapped
out.
