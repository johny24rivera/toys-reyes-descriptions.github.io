    For his "regular" Warrior
figure, Bumblebee's car mode has been replicated VERY close the show model.
It's got a fairly low roof, but then again so does the show model; the
proportions are pretty much perfect, with a long straight angular front
hood, several diagonal points on the windows and top hood, and small pointy
spoilers on the sides of the back. Other than seeing some of the robot
chest and bits inside the transparent blue windows, there's no robot mode
extras, which is always a big plus (the toy has an actual back end to the
vehicle-- yay)! The mold detailing, as you'd expect from a RID2015 toy,
is pretty sparse, with a few lines and "divots" in a few places like behind
the rear window, and some nice "vents" on the front hood. The paint detailing
is used on the two black stripes on the front to good effect, which both
go down to surround the headlights, which are a nice shade of blue. Unfortunately
there's not much paint otherwise (ignoring the yellow paint on the transparent
blue windows to make them "blend in" with the surrounding yellow plastic--
speaking of which, the yellow paint matches the yellow plastic quite well,
so no issues there). The taillights have no paint, and neither are there
the show-accurate black stripes on the sides. Bumblebee's sword is stored
on the underside of this mode, though it only connects at one point and
it's long enough where it should connect at two, so it does "wobble" a
little underneath.

    For robot mode, the
rear portion and the car doors fold behind the main body, while the arms
splay out a bit from the shoulders and the windows fold down to the front
section and the whole fornt section rotates around to become the robot
feet. As a whole, this is a pretty solid mode-- it's certainly quite accurate
to the model, with the little side doors behind the back just like on the
show model. That said, the rear section of the car mode hangs off his upper
back and bulks it up a bit unnecessarily, and should fold down more and
out of the way or something-- it makes him look back-heavy, even though
he's relatively well-balanced in terms of weight. The windows on the back
of the lower legs also don't look that great, and the upper legs are a
bit too small proportionally. The "core" of this mode is excellent, though,
with a well-proportioned chest and waist, shoulders and arms, and lower
legs. I like how well the arms are proportioned in particular-- usually
the lower arms can often be undersized, but here they're pretty nice. The
feet and lower legs look pretty decent as well, though there's no heels
so Bumblebee can fall backwards a bit more easily than I'd like. The head
detailing is spot-on to the show, as is the "vest-like" detailing on the
chest. The black paint is used to great effect throughout the robot mode
to keep the colors mixed up. There is a little light milky gray on the
upper legs, back, and connector parts that is rather blah, but it's not
used much on parts that are easily visible. There's some silver on the
face, but not really anywhere else. The transparent blue sword looks pretty
good, but it really needed some paint along the handle-- being all transparent
blue looks kinda weird. 'Bee's eyes are also transparent blue and set up
for great light piping, but the fronts are actually painted OVER with light
blue paint. Err... what? For articulation, Bumblebee can move at the neck,
shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), waist rotation, and
movement at the hips, knees (at two points), and slightly forward at the
ankles. Thus he's pretty poseable-- again, keeping the whole "no heels"
thing in mind.

    Bumblebee's a pretty
good Warrior class representation of the character in both modes, with
only some minor extra issues in robot mode and missing some paint in vehicle
mode. He's nothing spectacular, but he does the job, and is a recommendation
if you want a toy of this version of the character.

     NOTE: Bumblebee also was packed in a Toys "R" Us-exclusive "Decepticon
Island Showdown" set with
     <a href="rid2steeljaw.html">
      warrior Steeljaw
     </a>
     ,
along with some Decepticon Hunter weapons and a stasis pod that they can
fit into. The toys themselves are unchanged from the mass releases, though.
