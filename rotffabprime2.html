    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Double Blade Optimus Prime.

     Power Armor Optimus Prime
is more or less Prime with his dark blue replaced with black. Granted,
there's a bit more to it than that, but that's the major change. Otherwise
Optimus' core colors are the same-- particularly the red, and the flame
paint apps are basically the same in vehicle mode as well (though the door
flames are gone). The gray has been made a bit darker on this version compared
to Double Blade Optimus Prime, and the metallic silver is now a duller,
more gunmetal gray color. Both of those are positive changes and help to
add contrast against the red, methinks. In vehicle mode, the added black
actually makes Prime a tad less exciting, since I think the original dark
blue mixed with the red a bit better. In robot mode the differences are
a bit more obvious, with the colors a bit more varied-- Optimus Prime's
"shoulder bits" are now black with some really nice Cyberglyphic writing
on them, and the nice touch of bronze on the chest and metallic gunmetal
gray and dark blue on the legs really goes together well. Given that the
black is a bit more apparent in this mode than the blue on Double Blade
Optimus Prime, it helps to give Prime a more varied and attractive look
in robot mode. Plus, he's got a few more detailed paint apps too, such
as on his feet and faceplate.

     FAB Power Armor Optimus
Prime doesn't seem to have much of a "power armor" feel to him, given that
the main difference is merely the changing of Prime's traditional dark
blue to black. It works a bit better than the original in robot mode (and
the more varied paint apps help), but in vehicle mode the black makes him
look a bit less eye-catching. I'd recommend him slightly over Double Blade
Optimus Prime, but Power Armor Optimus Prime isn't nearly different enough
of a repaint to recommend again if you already have this mold.
