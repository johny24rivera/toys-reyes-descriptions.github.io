    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Iron Man Flying Wing. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     For this "Silver Centurion"
redeco in the Iron Man line, Iron Man still retains his basic red color
scheme, but the red has been changed to a less "primary" shade of the color.
It's a richer, deeper red, and really looks quite nice, even by itself.
The silver paint goes with it quite nicely, but unfortunately that's more
or less all this version of Iron Man's got going for him color-wise, making
him rather two-tone. The plastic on the upper appendages in mech mode is
a glossy shade of light gray, making it for all intents and purposes the
same general color as the silver. The black used on the cockpit windows
isn't nearly prevalent enough to really "count". Iron Man does have some
nifty gimmicky paint apps, though-- the off-white paint apps on the "star"
symbols on his wings, as well as on his engine-shoulders, the circle on
his mech chest, the circles in the middle of his hands, and his eyes are
all glow-in-the-dark paint! It glows pretty well, too, though of course
the gimmick only goes so far-- it's a bit hard to play with a Transformer
in the dark, after all. Plus, this shade of off-white isn't different enough
from the silver to really add anything to the color scheme, unfortunately.

     "Silver Centurion" Iron
Man has a better shade of red than the original release of this version,
but silver/gray is the only other real color of note on the toy. Even though
both colors go together quite well, it means the toy's lacking in visual
variety, even with the nifty "glow in the dark" paint apps. Still, recommended
slightly over the original release of this mold.

       Some targets are too hot for even Iron
Man to attack directly. That's why this high-flying armor suit exists.
Flying at the highest parts of the atmosphere, it drops super smart bombs
designed to stop the bad guys. Then Iron Man can dive in and eliminate
any enemies left standing.
