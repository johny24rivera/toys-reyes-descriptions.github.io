    The ultra version of
Bumblebee comes with a fairly slick car mode-- there aren't really any
proportional problems here whatsoever, and the only real robot "extras"
are very minor (just the tips of the robot feet visible on the back end).
However, even for a Cyberverse toy, the mold detailing is rather minimal
in this mode. I get it's supposed to be a sleek sportscar, but it's a bit
TOO sleek-- almost no substantial molded-in details across the bulk of
the car, beyond a small vent in front of the little "buttons" coming out
from the side that are supposed to be his rear view mirrors. There's some
basic panel layering on the back end, and of course that obvious spoiler.
He's got some basic taillight and rear vent details back there, but unfortunately
none of them are painted. The front grill details are much crisper and
stick out more, with some bulbous headlights and an angular front bumper.
The front details are painted, too-- some black on the grill and bumper,
as well as some fairly light electric blue on the headlights (oddly it's
a different shade of blue than the other blue paint on him). There's also
two thin black stripes going down across most of the top of the vehicle,
minus the back quarter or so. The windows are painted a nice light sky
blue, which contrasts exceedingly well with the dull milky yellow used
for the vast majority of 'Bee's plastic. The yellow plastic has a nice
semi-metallic sheen to it, having some glitter in the mix. Overall the
colors are varied enough in this mode, though I would've preferred a few
more paint apps on the sides or back. Bumblebee's gimmick is pretty cool
in this mode-- pull back on the rear spoiler and the sides of the car mode
fold down, with firing missile pack sides rotating forward! They look pretty
neat even if they don't actually fire any missiles, and are fully painted--
the pods themselves are black, the missiles a bright green, and the "smoke
trails" white. The mold detailing for these little bits is pretty well-done,
with the smoke trails themseles being particularly nicely detailed. There's
also some basic cybernetic details inside some of the exposed bits of Bumblebee
when this gimmick is deployed. When you're done, just push the spoiler
forward again and the missiles go back in. (This gimmick can't be used
in robot mode, unfortunately.)

    Transforming Bumblebee
to robot mode is quite simple, even for an Action Attacker. Just spread
apart the rear portions a bit to separate the legs, then fold around and
down the side headlight/car door sections and fold down the bumper sections
to form the shoulders and arms (it can be a little bit of a tight fit),
and you're pretty much done. (The small hood section is spring-loaded for
some reason-- you have to push it back for robot mode, but it'll spring
forward for car mode.) The end result is... not great. Granted, the proportions
on the "core" of the robot are great. He's got proportional legs, with
all the molded-in details you'd expect from his Cyberverse design-- the
faux rear bumper-knees, the segments on the gray upper legs, faux taillights
on the feet, a fairly skinny waist and stomach, a faux hood-chest, and
the like. The headsculpt is spot-on, with relatively small "devil horns"
compared to G1 Bee, but bigger eyes and a larger forehead vent. The headlight
sections form solid shoulders, and the lower arms do have a bit of the
car doors sticking off of them, but are pretty well-proportioned too. No,
the elephant in the room is the HUMONGOUS backpack he's got-- the entire
top section of his car mode, since that whole portion is all involved in
his missile gimmick. It's VERY difficult to overlook, given how much it
expands him especially around the waist section, which should be thin.
Moreover, the articulation is very limited-- the legs can only move side-to-side
a bit at the hips, and his shoulders can move around at two points. There's
not even elbow articulation, even though the gimmick shouldn't interfere
with that. Especially from a side or back view, you can basically see this
mode is just the car mode standing on its back end with the arms out and
a small hood panel on the upper back. This might be okay for a small, simplistic
toy, but for a $20 Ultra toy? Not so much, regardless of a gimmick. The
paint apps visible in this mode do the job-- beyond the gray on his upper
legs, he's got some silver on his waist and face; some light blue on his
eyes and faux window-chest; red dots on the faux taillights on his knees;
and some added black stripes on his chest and forehead. There's still too
much yellow on his arms and especially the lower legs, though.

    Overall, the first Ultra
toy of Cyberverse Bumblebee is a swing and a miss. He's got a nifty car
mode and gimmick, but it's almost like the designers forgot until the last
minute that this is a Transformer, and needs a robot mode, too! The robot
mode is far too much of an afterthought on this toy, with everything but
the arms and shoulders just being molded onto the underside of the vehicle
mode, which just isn't acceptable for a toy of this size/price. Even though
the second ultra Cyberverse Bumblebee toy is smaller, it's a better Transformer,
and recommended over this one.
