    Beast mode is a wasp,
and a repaint of the original

    toy. The color scheme to this mode is, well, interesting. Although the
gold on the abdomen and the transparent dark blue wings are nice, the lavender
just doesn't seem right on a wasp, and it makes Waspy look like some kind
of albino insect. The greenish-yellow and the red eyes are cool, though.
One of the main structural problems I have with this mode is the fact that
the back legs looks way too big to be insect legs, and don't look right
in this mode. Also, Waspinator's robot hands are clearly visible, even
from a side view. He also can't stand on his insect legs.

    Robot mode is a little
better than his beast mode, but that darn lavender still clashes with the
other colors and stands out. Also, the insect legs stick out a lot in this
mode, and although they don't get in the way very much, they just look
odd. Other than that, there are no significiant extras in this mode other
than the wasp abdomen, but this doesn't get in the way much. Waspinator's
mutant head (used on the TV show) and robot head can be accessed by flipping
open the panels on his chest and back and rotating the two heads to wherever
you want them to go.

    A nicely done transformer
in robot mode, but the color scheme is kinda weird, and the beast mode
looks sort of odd.

      Like a rattle snake's tail before an
attack, a chilling sound buzzes in the distance as if to forecast approaching
danger. Suddenly from the sky the giant wasp appears, revealing its monstrous
face and bulging eyes as it streaks down for an aerial attack! The Waspinator
launches its secret wing missiles, striking the helpless victims below
with the poisonous power of a robotic cyber-sting!
