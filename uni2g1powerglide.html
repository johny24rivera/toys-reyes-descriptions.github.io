    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original, mass-release
Universe 2.0 Powerglide. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Universe 2.0 Powerglide

     Odd that the store-exclusive
repaint of Powerglide is the G1-accurate one, considering that the first
version was meant to obviously be the G1 character, too. Well, regardless,
Powerglide is now in colors much more reminiscient of his original form,
with red being the dominant color this time as opposed to white. (The white--
or, rather, a "dirty" coloration of it-- is now the secondary color, so
they've essentially swapped places.) He also still has some black as a
bit of accent color, used mostly on his robot parts. All in all, it looks
quite good, and certainly better than the swapped color palette of his
original version. However, it still doesn't look as good as it COULD--
there are some definitely large areas of red plastic that are bereft of
paint apps, making him a look a little more "boring" than he otherwise
would have. He has some pretty interesting paint apps-- I like the Autobot-star
insignias on the wings and the metallic blue on his stomach particularly
well. (More of that metallic blue really would've made the paint job snap,
in my opinion.) I also really love the "NAWAYW360" on his tailfins-- it's
short for "And away we go!", his catchphrase in the G1 cartoon. However,
these paint apps tend to be more "concentrated" in certain areas, leading
to an impression that he doesn't have many paint apps when he does, in
fact, have an average amount.

     The "G1" redeco of Universe
2.0 Powerglide is a color scheme many fans of the character have been waiting
for, and if you're one of those fans, but all means it's a worthy purchase.
Still, it could have been done better, with the paint apps spready out
more evenly so his form-- particularly in vehicle mode-- didn't look so
sparse. Given that I think the
     <a href="uni2stormcloud.html">
      Stormcloud
redeco
     </a>
     looks much better overall, though, and given this exclusive's
slightly-inflated pricepoint, I'd have to recommend Stormcloud instead
if you only want one version of this mold.

       Even before the war, Powerglide took
great pride in his abilities as a flyer. He would blast into the sky at
top speed with little or no provocation, twisting, diving and looping in
an attempt to impress anyone who might glance skyward. He continues to
be proud of his skills, which can sometimes annoy the other Autobots, who
he sometimes mocks for their inability to fly. Despite this, the other
Autobots all recognize his skill, and appreciate the cover he offers them
from high in the air.
