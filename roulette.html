    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RiD Side Burn. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of RiD Side Burn

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Roulette is a partial
remold of RiD Side Burn, but it's a significant remold- this mold is now
female, thanks to the face being completely changed! The thing is, this
toy "sex change" actually works, to a certain extent. It isn't a stretch
to attribute Side Burn's physique to a female's. I don't like the actual
face itself, though- although the Romanesque "helmet" loks nice, the lips
are too big and puffy, and a bit corny, if I do say so myself.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     As for the color scheme
itself, it is VERY nice. The silver and shiny purple color scheme is delicious,
and, when you compine it with the black, I could stare at it for a looong
time. The tannish-orangish-brown I'm lukewarm about, but you can't have
everything all the time, I suppose. And yes, she has the "Dodge" symbol
on the front of the car. I DO like Side Burn's "flame" pattern on the hood
better than I like the two stripes, though.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Roulette is about as
good as you can hope the Side Burn mold can get. An excellent color scheme,
practically all around. Don't like the female face, though- too corny.
If it were by itself, I'd recommend it wholeheartedly, but considering
she comes packed with another toy that's exactly the same mold-wise...
eh, it's up to you if you want essentially two of the same toys. And her
transformation is still a big pain in the butt.

       As one of the few survivors of a nomadic
raid against her village, Roulette was determined to join the law enforcement
division and use her uncanny marksmanship to bring perpetrators to justice.
Entering the same annual IntraFormers Sharpshooting Competition as the
famed Sureshot, Roulette won an impressive second place victory besides
the likes of Optimus Prime and Megatron. She later enrolled in the Academy
for Cybertronian Law Enforcement and rose through the ranks quicker than
any previous recruit. Shortly thereafter, Roulette found herself fighting
on the side of the Autobots. In robot mode, Roulette uses a high-velocity
sonic blaster to hit the head of a pin at a distance of 6 miles.
