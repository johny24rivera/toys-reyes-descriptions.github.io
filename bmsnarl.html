    Beast mode is a lion.
This mode is pretty well-done, and the color scheme is pure eye candy.
The gold and silver complement each other very well, as do the transparent
blue and orange. If you turn his lion face from side to side, a "growling"
action will activate, but this is only so-so. The only problem I have with
this mode is the fact that Snarl merely looks like a humanoid lion crouched
down on all fours. His front feet reveal his robot hands very easily. I
wish Hasbro could have come up with some way to hide his thumbs. His back
legs also look a bit oddly jointed, but this is no big deal. His spark
crystal can be found by using a rather creative tactic- on his left back
leg, slide the hip panel up. What was before a transparent blue circle
now reveals the spark crystal! Very creative.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Before I get to the
robot mode, a few notes about the transformation. First, Snarl's transformation
is very uncreative and boring. It's basically a "stand me up and flip my
head" transformation, with only a few slight moderations. The instructions
say to turn his feet around so that what looks like the heel is facing
front, but this looks rather odd, and very few people actually do it. His
mane pieces also have a tendency to pop off during the transformation,
but this is no big deal.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Snarl's robot mode is
also very appealing visually. I especially love the large "mane" coming
off his robot head- it definitely adds character. This is one of the few
Maximals that actually looks more technological than organic, which is
a plus in my book. He has a lot of transparent blue in this mode, but most
of it is covered up by various opaque paints, adding to the diversity of
colors. However, Snarl's legs are, again, oddly jointed in this mode, and
it's hard to get them into a "normal" position. His weapon is also pitifully
small, and not very sharp-looking. Snarl's action gimmicks also ruin part
of this toy. Although the gimmick where you can open and close his robot
mouth by pressing a button are cool, the other two are not. His right arm
has a knob that you can turn for a karate chop/slashing action. This inhibits
the movement of the arm a lot, as the elbow can not stay in certain positions
very well unless you hold the knob and forcefully push the elbow into a
locking position. Otherwise, the elbow will always be stuck in a "straight
out" position. The gimmick on the other arm, although it doesn't inhibit
movement, is just plain lame and wasn't needed. Press the button and Snarl's
arm pops out, like, not even half an inch, for a stupid "punching" action.
There are also some posability problems with this mode too. First off,
Snarl's upper leg and shoulder articulation is limited because of the large
"metal" plates on the upper part of the appendages, which are bulky and
can prevent some movement. The wrist guards also get in the way of hand
articulation some.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    All in all, a very visually
appealing character, but the bad gimmicks and the uncreative transformation
hurt this toy a bit. Still, a great Maximal to have.

      As a strategic genius, Snarl is a critical
component of the Maximal command. Has the uncanny ability to sense his
opponent's weaknesses and exploit them to Maximal advantage. Considers
Vehicons a substandard challenge to his abilities - desires a match of
tactics and cunning against Megatron where the victor wins the war over
Cybertron. Has an ambush style of attack that rarely leaves his enemies
the option of survival.
