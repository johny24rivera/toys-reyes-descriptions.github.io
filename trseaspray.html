    This new Legends class
version of Seaspray is quite accurate to his G1 version in terms of its
overall construction and design-- though of course, updates have been made
to make him look more "modern". In hovercraft mode, Seaspray largely looks
pretty proportional overall, with a blue "bumper" around everything except
the backside, windows on the front, a missile pack on the top for some
weaponry, and some twin propellers near the back that can spin pretty freely.
The propellers themselves are the only thing that are a bit out of proportion--
they're too small, and should have been larger to believably provide Seaspray
with some thrust in this mode. The robot mode extras are MOSTLY absent
in this mode, though there's one fairly obvious sore thumb, and that's
the robot head in front of the propellers. I mean, there's a little white
plate that comes up in front of the face to "hide it"-- and it does hide
the face, but not the head. That's a bit unfortunate; I wish the head had
folded away somewhere. As far as mold detailing, Seapspray gets the job
done; there's some rear thrusters near the bottom of the back end, some
tech-like details and lines over much of the main body, some minor angular
details on the front, and some vent-like details near the top back end.
It's pretty well-done, though not eye-poppingly complex like some other
Titans Return toys. The color scheme is vintage Seaspray, with the naval
colors of blue and white making up much of the color scheme; they certainly
contrast against each other well, and are segmented logically, with blue
being mostly near the bottom of this mode while white makes up most of
the body. The rear top section also has some yellow, though it's a pale
yellow-- having it be a bit bolder would've helped it contrast better,
methinks. There's also some white paint apps on the sides of the front,
black paint on the windows, red paint on the front of the missile launcher,
and some simple paint decals on the top of the body that mimic his G1 stickers,
with some simple blue, red, and yellow rectangular and triangular shapes
with some silver underlay. Oddly, Seaspray has no little pegs on his entire
body to fit a Titan Master on, nor is there any sort of openable cockpit
for a Titan Master to fit in-- even though he's a new mold made for the
line, it seems like he was initially planned for another line, given his
complete lack of interaction with the chief figures of Titans Return.

    To transform Seaspray
to robot mode, you unfold the legs out from the front section, fold that
whole section up, rotate around the rear side sections to become his arms,
them fold down the rear propeller section into the new cavity under the
body to become his head and shoulders. The end result looks pretty nice
overall. My biggest issue with this mode is that Seapsray definitely has
some big clonkin' shoes. Granted, that's kind of been his "thing" regarding
his G1 design, but they seem even more exaggerated here. Still, at least
he has no problem standing up by himself! His legs are also a bit thick
proportionally, but nothing compared to the feet. Due to the way his arms
form the rear side sections, they're cut a bit oddly at the elbows, but
this is a small complaint-- they're largely pretty solid. The white body
is pretty square, with the aforementioned simple decals helping to break
up all that white some, though another paint app or two wouldn't have hurt.
His headsculpt is pretty accurate, with a black-painted visor, a faceplate,
and a simple round "helmet" around his head-- it's one of the less humanoid
TF faces. He's got his propeller sections for shoulders, which fit in pretty
nicely with the G1 toy-- though you wonder how Seaspray can see to the
side... For articulation, Seaspray can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows,
hips (at two points), and knees (at two points, though one is used for
transformation). Overall he's fairly poseable, though the lack of waist
rotation for no apparent reason hurts him a bit. Seaspray's missile launcher
can be held in either hand, but it slots into a small rectangular hole
behind each fist; the fists can't hold the weapon themselves, which in
turn means other Titans Return toys can't hold Seaspray's weapon.

    Titans Return Seapspray
is one of the better Legends class figures, keeping pretty true to his
G1 self in both modes while modernizing some aspects of him slightly. I
would've liked a bit MORE modernization, but I can see why they wanted
to appeal to the fans who just wanted a straight-up G1 redo. He has a couple
of minor kibble and proportional issues-- particularly the fairly obvious
head in vehicle mode and the huge feet in robot mode-- but nothing that
remotely ruins either mode. Recommended, though his inability to interact
in any way with Titan Masters is baffling.
