    The creatively-named
Lizard-- or "Cyber Lizard", if you go by the front of the package--has
an alt mode of... some kind of ground vehicle. The packaging doesn't really
describe it, and beyond the wheels and a cockpit of some sort on the front
I don't really see any identifying features, so yeah. A ground vehicle.
As with pretty much every other toy in the "Flip and Attack" subline, the
alt modes of these toys (based in general design upon the Jumpstarter toys
in the original G1 Transformers series) only vaguely look like a vehicle.
More specifically, they look like the mech mode tipped on its back with
the legs brought up over it. That said, I do like the "claw spikes" on
the front end of the vehicle, as they're completely hidden in mech mode
and give a nice little additional flair to the vehicle mode. The mold detailing
itself is quite varied on the figure, with most of the vehicle parts being
relatively sparse with detailed scaley "Lizard-y" bits here and there throughout.
The machine guns on the sides also are welcome little details to give Lizard
some ranged weaponry. The paint job is probably the best part of this mode,
as all of the green has a metallic sheen to it where it LOOKS like it's
all painted on-- I'm not sure if it all IS, but it sure looks like it.
It's also the perfect color for a lizard (sorry,
    <b>
     L
    </b>
    izard), and there's
a pretty good amount of silver and orangish yellow paint on the figure
as well, both of which contrast quite well with the green. (There's a little
amount of dark green and black on the figure towards the back, too, to
work as complementary colors.)

    To transform him, wind
Lizard back in his vehicle mode on a flat surface until you hear a clicking
sound on the wheels, then let it go-- the legs will flip forward abruptly
a couple seconds later, the weight and torque of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Lizard stand up into his mech mode on his own. It only seems to
happen about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time in my experience, though-- the other
times he just unfolds and rockets forward a bit to clatter around on his
front or backside. It's pretty cool when done right, however. In mech mode,
Lizard now resembles a mechanized version of how he looks in the
    <i>
     Amazing
Spider-Man
    </i>
    movie, complete with... an
    <i>
     incredibly creepy
    </i>
    head.
I mean, the other "Flip and Attack" figures tend to have adequately mechanized
faces, but beyond a few minor springs 'n such toward the neck, the face
looks just like Lizard's. Complete with detailed eyes with pupils. They
follow you everywhere-- I wish they had deviated from how he looked in
the movie a bit more so he looked more like a mech here. Lizard also comes
with-- ta-da!-- a little tail piece that can move on a hinge near his butt,
giving this toy a little more individuality among the "Flip and Attack"
figures beyond just the colors and mold detailing. Other than this, he's
pretty much your average figure from the line in this mode-- he can only
move back-and-forth at the shoulders (not even head movement so I can turn
him to look away from me... *shudder*)-- everything else is locked-in in
terms of stance in this mode, mostly due to his gimmick.

    Flip and Attack Lizard
has a really creepy head in mech mode, but other than that he ranks average
to slightly above-average among the "Flip and Attack" subline, with some
pretty nice, mostly metallic colors and a nice amount of paint detailing,
a little extra tail piece, and some cool hidden "claws" at the front of
his vehicle mode. That said, as a poseable toy or a recognizable vehicle
he's definitely not up to snuff-- like the rest of this subline, unfortunately.
