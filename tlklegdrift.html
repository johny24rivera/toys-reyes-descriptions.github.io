    Drift's alternate mode
as a Mercedes-AMG GT R is pretty accurately replicated for this teeny tiny
version-- as most licensed alt modes tend to be. The proportions are spot-on,
with the only real extra being that you can see the hinges for his knees
on the back end instead of him having being solid back there with visible
bits like full taillights, a license plate, and the like. For this tiny
scale though, honestly that's pretty acceptable. Given that he's a sleek
sportscar, he doesn't have a whole lot of mold detailing on the top in
this mode, but what he does have is a little underwhelming-- beyond the
very basic lines for things like windows, he's got some of the basic grill
details, along with a "swoosh" in his doors and headlights, but honestly
the only thing kind of impressive here is that his wheel hubs have some
little spokes detailed in there. This would be fine for a more "cartoony"
Transformer, but for a movie toy I expected a bit more mold detailing.
This is made worse by the fact that this mode is almost all unpainted black
plastic-- the only exception being a red line on the bottom of his front
and car doors. He really needed some silver on his windows and headlights
or something to break up all this black more. Of final note is that there
is a hole in the top of the roof for a Cyberverse/legion-scaled accessory,
if you have one.

    To transform Drift to
robot mode, fold his front halves down and to the side to become his arms,
while the back halves separate a bit, with the lower legs folding out and
around. The end result looks very much like much like your average Legion
toy, minus the legs. That is, most of his robot mode details are on larger
parts that form sections of his car mode-- the arms obviously have the
front windshield and car door shells on them, and less obviously, the rear
car shells on the upper legs. It's more or less expected at this scale,
but I find the proportions rather odd for Drift's appendages. The shoulders
are HUGE compared to the relatively tiny molded-in lower arms and hands
(which can hold Legion-scaled weapons), and the way the lower legs transform,
they give him "chicken-walker" legs. Only problem is, uh... Drift's legs
are supposed to be normal. They're not jointed like that. Not only is it
odd and unnecessary, but it makes him pretty difficult to stand up-- he's
got tiny feet. Still, at least the mold detailing for this mode is much-improved
compared to the car mode. There's some very nice samurai-like armor bits
on his upper legs and upper arms, and the faux Mercedes bumper is pretty
well-done, molded in his chest as it is. His headsculpt is also pretty
good for the scale, with all the necessary headcrests on his samurai-helmet.
His face and top headcrests are painted gold, with blue eyes. Otherwise
red is the only other color seen in this mode beyond black, and is used
on his upper arms, upper legs, and much of his main body-- so at least
it breaks up all that black pretty nicely now. For articulation, Drift
can move at the shoulders, hips, and back-and-forth at his weird chicken-knees.

    TLK legion Drift has
his good points-- such as a pretty proportional, kibble-free alt mode and
some good detailing in robot mode-- but the awkward proportions in robot
mode, particularly for the legs, make him a below-average Legion toy overall
and definitely not one of the stronger toys of the character.
