    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RiD Prowl.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original RiD Prowl

     Inferno's red-and-white
color scheme is certainly fitting of an emergency vehicle. The gold, brown,
and black enhance the robot mode look as well, and as you can tell from
his color scheme list above, Universe Inferno has a TON of colors. I'm
hesitant to say he actually has more paint apps than some of this mold's
predecessors, but he certainly has a greater variety of colors than ANY
of them. What's really odd- and cool- about his vehicle mode, though, is
that if you take off the jet boosters, he's pretty much a dead ringer for
     <a href="g1redalert.html">
      G1 Red Alert
     </a>
     . I mean, it's got the little
Fire Department symbols on the sides and everything. Which really makes
you wonder why he wasn't named Red Alert in the first place... (Actually,
it's been said that Red Alert was originally slated to be used as this
toy's name, but the names got switched up last minute when it was too late
to make any changes. Whoops.)

     Universe Inferno is
a pretty nice repaint of a pretty nice toy, although I still like Super
RiD Prowl's color scheme a little better. He sure should have been named
Red Alert, though. The mold's starting to get a bit overused, as well...
