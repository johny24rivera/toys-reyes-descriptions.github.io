    Blackout's vehicle mode
is a Sikorsky Pave Low helicopter. This mode is VERY nice, being pretty
much perfect when it comes to proportions. The only robot extras in this
mode are a somewhat visible Scorponok on the rear underside and Blackout's
slightly visible robot hands on the rear end of his wings, but these are
both pretty minor extras, if that. All of the mold detailing is spot-on,
and the color scheme-- dull blue and black-- isn't very eye-catching, but
it's certainly realistic and fits an evil character like Blackout well.
He could definitely use a bit more paint detailing in this mode-- his cockpit
is really the only part of him that's adequately painted. Putting U.S.
Army decals, military reference numbers, or anything of the sort would
have helped and made him look a bit less plain here. Blackout has two gimmicks
in this mode-- first, if you press in the black button on the rear end
of this mode, the main rotor spins, and very well, I might add. (Blackout's
rear rotor can spin as well, but you have to do it manually.) Another black
button near the rear end of this mode, when pressed in, lets the rear gate
slide down and "launches" Scorponok onto the ground. Pretty cool, especially
when it comes to the mold detailing, though Scorponok, at this scale, is
very basic-- his only paint detailing is a black wash, and he only has
one point articulation, at the base of his tail. He's also a rather odd
off-white color, instead of the gray-and-brown coloration that he is in
the movie and on his deluxe-sixed toy as well. Blackout's gears, used for
the automorph feature in robot mode, are unfortunately misaligned, and
it takes a bit of skill to realign them. Without realigning the gears,
Blackout has a little trouble staying completely "solid" in this mode--
either the center of his cockpit is slightly misaligned with the side pieces
of said cockpit, or the pegs that connect his lower robot leg pieces to
the main body of the helicopter can come undone rather easily. Both of
these areas CAN be aligned correctly at the same time, but just a little
fiddling with the toy will "undo" either the center cockpit piece or the
robot leg pieces from their pegs, which can get a little annoying.

    Blackout's robot mode
is a bit kibble-ridden, but some aspects of it are still very cool-looking.
The robot head, for one, is EXTREMELY detailed and evil-looking, and the
black paint wash and transparent red light piping used for the optics only
enhances this. He's generally pretty accurate to the actual on-screen movie
design, though obviously a bit simplified. His proportions are spot-on,
with the rotor-hunchback and all. His articulation is also great-- he can
move at the head, shoulders (at three points), knees, partial movement
at his wrists, and movement at his waist, hips (at two points), and knees
(at two points). Blackout's overall chest design is also pretty good-looking,
with the head and well-detailed chest slid up between the helicopter cockpit
halves. He has the same impressive artillery that he has in the movie,
for the most part (though none of the guns can actually fire missiles);
he has four different guns on his shoulders, as well as one on the right
side of his chest. Plus, his entire rotor backpack can detact and be held
over his shoulder as a huge rotary blade weapon of death! It is a bit cumbersome
to have him carry it this way, though. I don't like how his helicopter
tail fin doesn't fold into itself at all in this mode, and essentially
serves as a third leg for Blackout. Granted, this makes him more stable
than he otherwise would have been, but it's a rather big vehicle extra.
(I don't mind the rotors themselvers so much, as dropped behind his back
like that, they look like folded insect wings, which is pretty darned cool.)
There's also little vehicle shell pieces on his lower arms that don't like
anything and stick out like a sore thumb. As far as his "automorph" feature
goes, when you push his waist up into its robot mode position, his chest
and head automatically rotate into their robot mode position. However,
due to the aforementioned gear misalignment, the automorph feature in his
legs doesn't work-- what's supposed to happen is that when you fold out
his lower feet and heels, a little piece on his lower legs is supposed
to fold out too-- it almost looks like a third toe, except higher up--
but this doesn't happen, so you have to pull it out manually. Blackout
is also very small for a Voyager class toy, being just barely taller than
your average deluxe. This is rather disconcerting, given how huge he is
in the movie. What I dislike most about this mode, however, are the rather
weak connection points between Blackout's main body and his shoulders--
only one tab holding together such large parts just doesn't cut it as far
as "closing the gap" between his body and shoulders, so they don't mesh
together and look as much the shoulder continues right from the body as
I'd like. Just adding one or two more tabs would have solved this problem
completely.

    Voyager-class Blackout
isn't as good as he could have been, but he's the best version of the character
to be released in the line that's known of as of this writing (9/07), and
he has a nearly-perfect helicopter mode with some great proportions and
detailing in robot mode. His kibble-heavyness and a few weak connections
in robot mode are his main downsides. Mildly recommended.

      Blackout is the largest of the Decepticons.
Most often seen looming silently over the right shoulder of Megatron, he
is his leaderÂ’s hound. He pursues relentless efficiency, allowing nothing
to stop him in his task. Those who defy him beware: his rage knows no bounds.
He will fill the air with fire and burn the land clear to take his revenge.
Paired with his minion Scorponok, he is a dangerous and a deadly foe.
