       Kobushi's scheme of purple,
light green, and gray really isn't appropriate for a sand rail, as it'd
stick out like a sore thumb in any arid area. However, that aside, this
color scheme rocks! The dark purple goes exceedingly well with the light
green, and are very dark, Decepticon-y colors. The gray also goes very
well with the other colors, and there's not enough of it to make the toy
drab, either. In addition, the white and silver paint apps contrast VERY
nicely with the purple, and the purplish-red visor paint app makes the
mold look bit more evil than it otherwise would have-- nice.

       No mold changes have
been made to Kobushi, but like the other members of his team, he has a
Decepticon symbol painted over his molded-on Minicon symbol, which is really
dumb...

         During the long years of relative solitude
before and since their discovery on the Moon by the larger Transformers,
Kobushi came to the conclusion that personal perfection could be attained
through challenging combat. Every enemy destroyed, he believes, adds to
his own power as a warrior. He has devoted his life to improving his martial
skill, adapting the ancient art of Metallikato to most effectively use
his diamond tipped drill arm. Landslide, the toughest individual on the
Exploration Team, has been his frequent opponent, and Kobushi challenges
him at every opportunity.

           Landslide's overall color
scheme fits together fairly well-- the light gray, black, and orange go
together significantly better than either of Landslide's teammates' color
schemes. The orange looks especially good against the yellow. Landslide
also sports noticeably more paint apps than his teammates, with some especially
nice black apps on his arms and chest. As on his other teammates, however,
I don't like the shade of yellow used-- it's a rather obnoxious shade,
and looks rather chinsy in quality (although it's actually not).

             Landslide is at peace always. His long
contemplation has taught him the path to inner stillness. He has let go
of the physical world, and embraced the world beyond. Recently, he has
discovered how to project his core programming out of his robotic body
for a limited time and into astral space. There, he has encountered ohter,
powerful beings, and learned many truths. Though Kobushi attempts to interrupt
his meditation at every opportunity with petty challenges, Landslide has
yet to fall before the aggressive robot's attacks, using his inner strength
and passive nature to create the ultimate martial defense.

             Kobushi vs. Landslide
is the best Vs. pack for wave two of the size category, with each Minicon
definitely winning out as the best-looking among their teammates. Altough
I probably recommend Buzzsaw's color scheme from the
             <a href="roadwrecker.html">
              Armada

             </a>
             a bit more than Landslide's, Kobushi definitely has
the best color scheme his mold has been given so far, so overall this pack's
worth picking up if you like Minicons.
