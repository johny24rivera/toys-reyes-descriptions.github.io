    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Republic
Gunship. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
SWTF Republic Gunship

     Boy, having all these
clones in Star Wars sure makes redecos as different characters easy, doesn't
it? This time around, the Republic Gunship has been done up as a named
clone-- Wolffe. His color scheme of white and dark blue remains intact
here, along with a little black and gray to bring in a truly dark color,
and all colors contrast against each other quite well-- though I wish just
a tad more of the white were painted, particularly in vehicle mode. What
really makes the color scheme pop, though, is the watery blue used around
the guns in vehicle mode and on the end of the arms, legs, and head in
mech mode. It really makes Wolffe stand out amongst a shelf of Star Wars
TFs, that's for sure. He also has a bit of a "custom paint job" below the
cockpit on each side of the vehicle mode, which helps to give the toy a
bit more character than simply "gunship redeco #3".

     No original mold changes
have been made to Clone Commander Wolffe, though he does have the same
slight head &amp; mold changes that the
     <a href="swtfgunship2.html">
      original
"Clone Wars" redeco
     </a>
     of this mold had.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Clone Commander Wolffe
doesn't quite top the original "Clone Wars" redeco of this mold in terms
of eye-catchiness, but he's close. The dark blue-on-white already looks
nice, but add in those "custom" paint apps on the sides of the vehicle
mode and those wonderful watery blue paint apps and he's my 2nd-favorite
release of this mold. Recommended, particularly if you don't have a version
of this mold and want it to be a specific character, as it's a pretty good
one for the line.
