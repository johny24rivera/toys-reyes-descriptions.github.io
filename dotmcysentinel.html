    This movie incarnation
of Sentinel Prime transforms into a Rosenbauer fire truck. In vehicle mode,
there's little to complain about, particularly for a figure at the Cyberverse
scale. The proportions are spot-on (as you'd expect for a licensed vehicle),
with the only real extra being that you can see the sword stashed underneath
the wheels if you look at him from a side angle-- but this is pretty minor.
The color scheme of black, red, and gray is pretty straightforward, but
it's certainly still fitting for a fire truck, and the black angular stripes
on the bottom third of this mode help to break up the red a bit. The windows
desperately need some paint apps, but otherwise the necessary paint is
there, such as his Rosenbauer emblem, Autobot symbols, and "316" markings
on his sides. The mold detailing is really superb for the size, with anything
remotely needing detailing having it-- even right down to the tiny headlights
on his front bumper and the ladder on his back end (though they aren't
painted, natch). His ladder/gun weapon can rotate around its center point
in this mode, but not up or down.

    Sentinel's robot mode
is also generally pretty impressive, and manages to incorporate most of
his vehicle parts into his overall form pretty well. The sides of the vehicle
form his arms and shoulders pretty accurately, with parts of his roof forming
a "cape" behind him that looks cool, but isn't so large that it gets in
the way of movement or articulation. The sides of the front bumper that
form his chest don't have pieces to "connect them" to each other, making
his chest look a tad off, but that's a small quibble. His legs suffer the
most from the size class, being a bit overly blocky (particularly at the
lower feet), and having shells of his vehicle mode hanging out in front
of said lower legs. That said, at least they don't get in the way of movement.
The mold detailing on Sentinel's robot bits-- like his face and chest--
are exquisitely done, even if the rather plain silver paint apps don't
bring out all that detail in the best way. Interestingly enough for a Commander-class
toy, Sentinel Prime comes with BOTH of his signature weapons-- a really
cool long double-bladed sword and a shield-gun made out of part of his
roof folded up. When it comes to articulation, Sentinel's is pretty decent
for a Commander figure-- he can move at the neck (but only up-and-down),
as well as at the shoulders (at three points), elbows, hips (slightly restricted
because of their square shape), knees, and ankles.

    Sentinel Prime is a
very well-engineered Cyberverse toy, looking very accurate in both modes
and only having some rather minor kibble in robot mode. Add that to his
good proportions, cool weaponry, and nice articulation, and unless you
absolutely must have a bigger Sentinel Prime and/or prefer very complicated
transformations, this is the version of the character I'd go after.

      Sentinel Prime is one of the greatest
heroes of the long war between Autobots and Decepticons. His courage and
strength are the stuff of legend. Now that he has returned, nothing will
stand between the Autobots and final victory.
