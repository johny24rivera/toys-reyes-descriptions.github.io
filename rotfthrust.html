    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RotF Breakaway toy.

     Like pretty much any
other jet repaint with the name "Thrust" in recent years, this version
of Thrust is an homage to the G1 Seeker jet of the same name. Hasbro mixed
things up a bit this time, though, instead applying Thrust's signature
colors of maroon, black, and silver to something that isn't a version of
Starscream-- this time Thrust is a repaint of Breakaway. Like on most versions
of Thrust, I quite like his color scheme. The maroon and black go together
quite well, and the silver paint apps really snap against said maroon.
The couple of light red paint apps that appear in robot mode also work
as a great accent color, and the light purple used for the transparent
parts is another winning color combo. Thrust also has a decent number of
paint apps, the only really big spot that doesn't have any being the underside
of his wings. However, as good as his color scheme is, some parts-- particularly
near the back of the jet mode-- could use a little more color variation.
Adding a bit more of the silver really could've helped him hit that really
sweet spot he falls juuust short of.

     Thrust has a new head
mold, which looks like a much smaller, less "coneheaded" version of his
G1 namesake, and with a faceplate instead of a mouth. The G1 homage intakes
on the side of his head are still there, though. It's a decent head mold--
not great, particularly given how small it is, but it's certainly not bad.

     RotF Thrust is a darned
good homage repaint, though a little bit more silver paint would've made
him even better. Although the mold itself is still rather mediocore, I'd
definitely recommend this version over Breakaway, easily.

       Thrust loves to fight, as long as he's
guaranteed to win. As soon as the odds turn against the Decepticons, he's
the first to run and hide. He relishes the chance to push around those
smaller and weaker than him, so Earth is the ultimate playground. He avoids
the Autobots completely, choosing instead to pick fights with small, lightly
armed groups of humans. Even then, as soon as the humans roll out any artillery,
or even rocket launchers, he heads for space, to lay low until he can stop
shaking from fear.

       (NOTE: The earliest releases of Thrust had the incorrect "traditional"
Decepticon symbols on the wings and chest-- seen in the pics above-- whereas
later releases of the toy had the correct Movie Decepticon symbols on them.
I think this makes a really minor difference though, if that.)
