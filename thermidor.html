    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior version
of Bisk. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RID2015 warrior

     Thermidor is sort of
an "inverse" redeco of Bisk-- instead of being in the orangish-red portion
of the color scheme, he's blue (and yes, there are blue lobsters). In vehicle
mode, his primary color is a milky dark blue, and looks like a really solid,
primary color that forms a good basis for the various paint apps. In robot
mode, he adds in some milky dull bluish gray, which serves as a nice color
that both complements and contrasts against the dark blue, and helps to
differentiate the robot mode more from the vehicle color-wise to boot.
I do wish it was a tad less gray and more on the blue side of things, but
this is a pretty minor issue overall. As for other colors, of course his
wheels are black, along with his guns (in terms of plastic) but his car
windows, center of the front bumper, section near the back bumper, faux
chest window, and waist are all painted black. So, basically all of the
black on Bisk is still black on Thermidor-- though on Thermidor they don't
contrast quite as well, due to the darker overall color scheme. He's got
some nice silver on his abs and on the sides of his front bumper, a bit
of orangish yellow on his more central headlights, and some red on his
side headlights and on the rims of his wheels. Needless to say, the red
and yellow really pop against the blue, and the silver really works well
against the dark blue, as well. Honestly I wish a bit more of the yellow/red/silver
had been used in place of a few of the black paint apps for some better
contrast. Finally, there's a painted version of the dull milky bluish gray
on the robot knees/car spoiler, which matches the plastic color quite closely,
though because it's paint it's not milky.

     Thermidor does have
a new headsculpt, and it's not quite as funky as Bisk's, as he's got a
more "normal" light pastel blue face with eyes and a mouth outlined by
black, which in term are surrounded by lobster-y parts like long antennae
at the top, a pointed forehead, and a "beard" made out of what would be
mandibles on a normal lobster. It's a stellar headsculpt, and if you're
put off by the weird-ness of Bisk's I'd encourage you to try this one instead.

     Thermidor is a fantastic
repaint of a fantastic mold, with a new headsculpt that looks even better.
I do wish some of his black paint had been replaced with something a bit
lighter, and that his bluish-gray plastic was a little more towards the
blue end, but these are very
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     minor complaints; overall this
is a fantastic toy, even better-looking than Bisk. If you told me I could
only keep one toy from the entirely of RID2015, it would be Thermidor.
