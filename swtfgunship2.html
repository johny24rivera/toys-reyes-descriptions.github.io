    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Republic
Gunship. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Following the idea of
the
     <a href="clonepilot2.html">
      Clone Pilot ARC Fighter redeco
     </a>
     , the
redeco of the Republic Gunship has a similar "tiger shark"-style paint
deco used on its vehicle mode. It looks really good in vehicle mode, as
you'd expect-- the dark blue stripes really add some nice contrast to the
mode, and the enlarged, cartoony, toothy "mouth" painted on the front of
the vehicle also looks great, as well. There is substantially more white
left on this redeco than on the ARC Fighter redeco, however, which I don't
consider this QUITE as a good of a repaint, though still certainly eye-catching.
The nearly-complete lack of tiger shark stripes visible in Mech mode makes
the Clone Pilot look particularly boring in that mode, something that the
ARC Fighter redeco didn't suffer from. A couple of light blue stripes on
the lower legs and head help some, but not enough to save it from all that
white, in my opinion.

     As with nearly all SWTF
"redecos", this isn't a straight redeco-- the Clone Pilot miniature that
comes with the toy has been changed slightly, and the Mech mode head has
been remolded into a slightly different, more "Clone Wars"-esque clone
helmet. I think one head looks just as good as the other, though, so I
don't have any preferences between the two versions of the mold when it
comes to this. Otherwise, no mold changes have been made to this figure
compared to its previous release.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     I think the tiger shark
"Clone Wars" redeco is quite the improvement over the admittedly dull original
colors on this mold, though all the paint apps in vehicle mode pay a price
when it comes to the Mech mode, what with all the uninterrupted white and
all. Mildly recommended.
