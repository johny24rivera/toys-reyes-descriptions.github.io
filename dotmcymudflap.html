    Unlike his twin brother
    <a href="dotmcyskids.html">
     Skids
    </a>
    ,
Mudflap's Cyberverse toy for the Dark of the Moon line is an entirely new
mold-- though from a quick glance at his vehicle mode, you'd be forgiven
for thinking that he's a repaint or remold of Skids. The vehicle mode is
still a Chevy Spark, with the main color difference between him and Skids
being that Mudflap has twin orange stripes down the center of this mode,
not green stripes. His spoiler is also a tiny bit larger and more square
than Skids', but you only really notice that upon visually comparing the
two side-by-side. The remainder of the mode is almost entirely black, though
the headlights and taillights are silver. The mold detailing is pretty
good and accurate to a Chevy Spark, but I wish a bit more paint was visible
in this mode, as from a side angle this mode looks almost entirely black.
Even though black is a fitting color for windows, painting them silver
would've worked, perhaps?

    The transformation to
Mudflap's robot mode mirrors Skids' fairly well, with the exception being
that his car doors stop only halfway out, to mimic Mudflap's "car door
shoulders" that he has on his
    <a href="dotmmudflap.html">
     larger DotM toy
    </a>
    and that were apparent on his previous Movie toys. His arms actually come
out from BEHIND the doors in this mode, though, which is a bit of an odd
decision. That said, this avoids making Mudflap's upper arms look too skinny,
and although his chest sticks out a bit too far and his head is a bit too
far back, otherwise proprtionally he's pretty decent for a Legion-class
toy here. Like his other twin, Mudflap has one arm that's larger than the
other, though
    <i>
     his
    </i>
    larger arm is his left. There's an adequate amount
of robot mold detailing here-- particularly on his waist and hands-- though
his legs could've used a tad more. At least said legs are painted with
the same chalky orange as his vehicle stripes, though, as is his headsculpt
(uuuughh, Mudflap's head design...). His eyes are also painted a rather
bright blue, which in my opinion doesn't go with the bright orange all
that well and makes his face look even creepier. I really think a bit of
silver/orange detailing on his fists would've helped make them stand out
more, however. When it comes to articulation, Mudflap can move at the shoulders
(at two points), elbows, and hips. Some knee articulation would've been
appreciated, but otherwise he's pretty good here for a Legion/Legends class
figure.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Mudflap's new "upgraded"
form is now largely like his twin's not only in robot mode but in vehicle
form as well. Though I certainly think there are better DotM Legion class
figures out there-- Mudflap's face still practically gives me nightmares--
for what it is, it's a pretty decent Legion class figure, head and chest
placement aside. Recommended over DotM Legion Skids because of some of
the proportional fixes to the design-- and, heck, he looks better than
his deluxe DotM toy as well.

      The energetic Mudflap is back and ready
to take on the baddest Decepticons yet. While his daredevil stunts appear
brainless, Mudflap is a true Autobot-- courageous and loyal to the end.
