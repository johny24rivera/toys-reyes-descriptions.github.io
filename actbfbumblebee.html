    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     ANOTHER repaint of the
Activators Bumblebee mold?! Well, regardless, it's an interesting twist
on the classic Bumblebee color scheme. Yellow is still the main color for
Bumblebee, though it's a noticeably brighter shade of yellow than on the
original Activator. There's also some black too, seen primarily on some
interior robot mode parts and the windshield, which is an interesting bluish-black
shade, making them look "heavily tinted" even though it's just paint. The
main "new" thing about Bumblebee this time around is the addition of quite
a significant amount of gray and silver, adding a third main color to his
scheme. The silver apint used on the stripes and sides of the vehicle mode
looks particularly good, though even the regular gray plastic used on some
robot mode parts a bit shiny, and was a nice choice. Given the addition
of all the gray and the dual silver stripes in vehicle mode, I'm fairly
certain this is a redeco homage to
     <a href="clasbumblebee.html">

     , a rather unexpected homage. Using the light pastel blue
sparingly for highlights also works decently on the toy, too (though better
against the silver than the yellow). The Autobot symbol on the chest/roof
is a bit obnoxiously large, though.

may not be a bonafide "repaint" give he's still mostly yellow and black,
but adding in the gray and silver makes him a bit more visually interesting
in my opinion, and looks particularly good in vehicle mode. If you're only
going to get one version of this mold, get

       When Optimus Prime told Bumblebee to
get ready for battle, he naturally figured the boss 'bot meant a new paint-job
and polish. Sure, there are a few new armor plates here and there, but
there's no excuse not to look good when you're trashing Decepticons.
