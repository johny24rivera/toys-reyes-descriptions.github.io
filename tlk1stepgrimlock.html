    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE 1-Step
Changer Grimlock toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Grimlock gets a redeco
for the TLK line more in line with his other TLK toys, which are generally
more accurate to his on-screen color scheme (although lacking some of the
more subtle "earthy" tints here and there on him). For Grimlock, that means
he's pretty much all gray. Thankfully, this toy doesn't suffer from that
awful light milky gray plastic that's found on lots of movie TF toys--
instead the main color of plastic used for him is a duller, brownish gray.
It's still not exactly an exciting color, but it looks better than the
light milky gray. This color of plastic is used for the base of nearly
every piece of Grimlock. The only pieces that aren't this shade of gray
plastic are some charcoal black pieces used for some small bits on his
chest, around the neck, and the upper legs of his robot mode. It's a decent
contrasting color, but what really brings this color scheme up in my estimation
is all the silver-- the toy's basically half-coated in it. There's silver
paint on the robot face, faux t-rex teeth on the chest, and most notably
the entire neck, back, and tail of the beast mode, minus some small parts
on the upper head and the inside of the pieces that make up his lower robot
legs. It looks quite nice, though I wish it had a color to pop off more
interesting than the brownish-gray-- well-painted or not, he's still pretty
much all one color. (His eyes in both modes are painted red, though.) Although
Grimlock certainly isn't a vehicle, he still has the same "Cyberfire" UV
paint gimmick that the other mass-release TLK 1-step changers do. This
can be activated by either shining a UV flashlight-- or, alternately, Mega
1-Step Dragonfire's "fire bulb" inside his mouth-- on Grimlock. This shows
a fiery paint app on his right beast hip (after all, he doesn't have a
hood), surrounding an Autobot symbol. Nifty, though kinda forced compared
to the vehicle 1-steps.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Grimlock.

     I appreciate all the
silver paint added to TLK 1-step Grimlock (especially in beast mode), but
ultimately, his color scheme's still pretty boring overall, with only a
little black in robot mode to contrast against all that gray. Add in the
weakness of the mold in both modes, and I'd definitely recommend pretty
much any other TLK Grimlock toy over this one.
