    Mold History

   : This mold was created
especially for the Scourge Spychanger mold for RiD, and it's been repainted
here as Optimus Prime.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RiD Scourge Spychanger.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RiD Scourge Spychanger

     I think it's rather funny
how the G2 Laser Optimus Prime was repainted into
     <a href="superscourge.html">
      RiD
Scourge
     </a>
     , which later had a Spychanger-sized version of him made, and
now things have come full circle with that Spychanger version being repainted
into Optimus Prime again, with colors highly resembling that of G2 Laser
Optimus Prime. Anyways, As you'd expect, his vehicle mode colors are definitely
familiar- the ol' red, silver, an' blue. It looks very nice and eye-catching,
although maybe the red could have been one shade darker. What's odd, though,
is that Optimus Prime still carries the same teal paint apps (in both modes)
that Spychanger Scourge has. They really do look nice with the other colors,
but teal hasn't really been major color of Optimus Prime's since... well...
ever. But even though it's still the same, the rest of the toy has been
changed, and these apps look great anyway, so I can easily get over it.
One oddity that I think is a flaw, though, is that his middle two tires
(which don't actually roll, but are just molded details) are blue like
the surrounding plastic. Compared with his other four black tires, this
really tends to stick out. In robot mode, Prime looks even better, since
his chest and face especially have oodles of paint detailing for such a
small figure. The yellow used for the bumper and robot eyes is also appropriate,
and blends in well with the other colors. Definitely a worthy Spychanger
version of Prime.

     No mold changes have
been made to Spychanger Optimus Prime.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although like all Spychangers,
Prime could definitely use more articulation, the paint job itself is great
and the paint apps are slightly original, while still being a big throwback
to all of the previous Primes. Even though I like Spychanger Scourge's
color scheme, Prime's just looks prettier and more varied. Recommended
over Spychanger Scourge.
