    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Hardtop. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Hardtop

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Hardtop's been repainted
for the Movie line, and like most of the other movie toys, he has a more
subdued, realistic color scheme than most Transformers released in the
past few years. With the exception of a few spots of yellow, there are
absolutely no bright colors on Hardtop whatsoever-- it makes him look very
military, which is of course appropriate for a Sector Seven vehicle (he
has S7 logos on both sides of his vehicle mode, as well as one on his Cyber
Key). And, although none of the colors really contrast with each other
because they're all rather dull colors, there's no large spot of only one
color, so the color variations keep Hardtop from looking too boring.

     With the exception of
a different pack-in Cyber Key, no mold changes have been made to Hardtop.

     Hardtop is an excellent
military-themed repaint, with a very realistic color combo that fits in
with the movie universe well, even if the mold itself doesn't. Some may
be put off by the fact that there's very little color contrast on him,
but Hasbro certainly accomplished what they wanted to accomplish with this
scheme, that's for sure. My personal favorite of the three paint jobs this
toy has received so far.

       As an elite tracker and spy for the
Decepticons, Hardtop has come into conflict again and again with Autobot
spy Bumblebee. What began as a professional rivalry defined by the limits
of their allegiances on opposite sides of a war became a full-fledged vendetta
over the years. The two robots have played a punishing game of cat and
mouse across the breadth of the galaxy; it is a little known fact that
it was a shot fired by Hardtop that took away his Autobot enemy's ability
to speak without pain.
