    In his individual robot
mode, Alchemist Prime is pretty darned generic, and could pass for a lot
of late-G1 Micromasters, Targetmasters, or Powermasters. He has pretty
normal fists molded into his arms, a window-like detail molded into the
middle of his chest, and some small lines and geometric designs on his
legs. His head has a normal face, eyes, and mouth, with a helmet with three
minor protrusions on the top-- again, like a heck of a lot of late-G1 generi-bots.
Unfortunately he's got no paint whatsoever in this mode, and his color
scheme is rather unimpressive-- he's got some teal on his main body and
lower legs, while the rest of him is a rather bleh shade of gray with a
tinge of brown in it that makes it look a bit "dirty". Not that great.
As with all Titan Masters, in this mode Alchemist Prime can move at the
neck, as well as back-and-forth at the shoulders, hips, and knees (the
latter two as one for both legs, since the legs are molded together). In
Alchemist's "Prime Core" mode, he's almost entirely that same shade of
gray, with a couple of angular details near the bottom and a few bits on
the top, while much of the face is filled with an arrow and several dots
of different sizes around it (all painted black) that look like some kinda
clock or maybe some meter. Uh... isn't time kinda

    thing? This is one of the weakest of all the emblem designs,
in my opinion. The colors are boring, and its inspiration is a bit
    <i>

    obvious.

    Alchemist's Pretender
shell is a miniature replica of the G1 Pretender Submarauder, some kinda
fish monster thing. The mold detailing is impressively intricate on the
front here, with Submarauder's "mohawk" fin, eyes, and vented mouth replicated
very faithfully and looking very cool to boot. He's got some armored pecs
and abs, along with an armored waist piece, armored-up knees, and large
toed feet. Although his main body is teal, his arms are unfortunately that
kinda ugly brownish gray, though they're impressively detailed in terms
of the molding as well, with little chainmail-like gauntlet details around
the lower arms. Just like with other Prime Master Pretender shells, Submarauder
can only move his arms back-and-forth at the shoulders in this mode; no
other movement is possible. This means that his weapon (which can be stored
on his upper back in this mode), which resembles the head of a trident
complete with little prongs at the end, is a bit of an odd choice, as he
can't hold it like a trident, and it doesn't have a "staff" part for his
fist to grab onto. Speaking of the back end of this mode, like with the
other PotP Pretender shells he looks a bit too "wide" from a side view,
and the back half has a lot more mechanical detailing, with vents, lines,
and the like in quite a few places, along with what look like tiny wires
criss-crossing on the upper back-- a nice little detail. None of the back
is detailed with paint, unfortunately, but there's quite a bit on the front--
the waist and trident weapon are painted a light purple, the knees are
that brownish-gray, the sides of his abs and chest are dark blue, his eyes
are dark red, and his mouth-vents are orange. It's a pretty good color
combo overall on the front, and looks great. Submarauder's weapon mode
works like all the other PotP Prime Master sets-- take the weapon, clip
it onto the back and rotate it out forward, rotate out the peg from in
between his legs for a larger TF to hold, and then just put him on his
stomach. (You can plug Alchemist Prime or another Prime Master into a segment
near the rear of the weapon to "power it up".) And, like basically every
other Prime Master weapon mode, it's pretty lame-- the trident prongs DO
look neat, but there's a large unnecessary body of... stuff... in between
where a TF will hold onto the weapon and where the weapon actually begins.
And of course, let's not forget the blatantly obvious legs and arms just
    <i>
     there
    </i>
    ,
and that's if you ignore the Pretender stuff on the underside.

    Alchemist Prime is a
pretty bland, uninteresting Prime Master, but the Submarauder Pretender
shell largely looks great, with lots of paint on the front and a nifty
weapon (even if he can't hold it correctly). The brownish gray I wish was
a more straightforward gray, however, and this set still has the same downsides
as the other Prime Master sets-- limited articulation, a super-lame weapon
mode, etc. However, out of the various Prime Master sets, I think this
is one of the stronger sets because of how great Submarauder looks.
