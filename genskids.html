    Skids' vehicle mode takes
less cues from his previous versions--which were

    ,

    cars-- and
goes for a more generic, compact sportscar type of look. Proportionally
everything looks pretty tip-top in this mode, with no robot mode extras
to speak of (his windows are too dark to see any robot bits through them).
He still keeps his G1 color scheme, though, being mostly blue with a white-and-red
stripe down the sides of this mode. His tires also have oddly red spokes--
not sure I like that, that's a bit weird-looking-- and he's also got red
taillights and a silver front grill with a few red and metallic yellow
details. Overall the color scheme is fairly basic, but it gets the job
done. There is a bit of blue paint used on the sides of his windows, and
it's just a TOUCH lighter in shade than his blue plastic-- but the difference
is slight, to be sure. Skids' mold detailing in this mode-- as befits a
sleek car mode-- is somewhat sparse, though a few places that need it--
like his front bumper, windshield wipers, and a back end with what looks
like rivets and armor plating-- still provide him with some intricate detailing
in spurts. Still, this mode feels like it needs just a touch more paint--
particularly on the top side, there's just a bit too much blue here. Painting
the rear end or rear view mirrors silver, perhaps, or making his transparent
dark blue plastic a shade that stood out a bit more among his color palette?
Any of those would've worked, in my opinion. Skids has two 5mm ports in
this mode, one on each side, in front of his rear wheels. What a co-winky-dink,
since he also comes with two guns that can be held in those two ports!
One gun looks a fair amount like his G1 gun, while the other is a smaller
pistol that looks like the gun he has in the comic series
    <i>
     More Than
Meets the Eye
    </i>
    . What's quite cool about these weapons, though, is that
you can actually plug his smaller pistol into his larger gun to make it
a longer gun-- how's that for mixing new with old, eh?

    Skids' transformation
is largely familiar when compared to other deluxe sportscar Transformers--
the front bumper becomes the chest, the sides become the arms, the roof
becomes the back, etc. There are a few differences, though, the biggest
one being how his legs transform-- yes, they're formed from the back end,
but the transformation also involves a waist rotation and separating and
flipping out of his feet from his shins, which is pretty interesting. Overall,
it's very apparent from both the detailing and general design of this mode
that this is clearly meant to be
    <i>
     More Than Meets the Eye
    </i>
    Skids,
rather than a direct update of his G1 version (in vehicle mode it was questionable)--
nearly all of the robot-specific details mesh with his design in that comic
miniseries, and his face sculpt (which is very well-done) has the sharp
nose and an expression that look like it came directly from Alex Milne,
the primary artist for that comic. Skids' proportions in this mode are
generally quite good, with the only caveat here being that his arms are
a tad short, particularly if you consider the entire wheel upper sections
to be his shoulders and not his upper arms (hey, it's debatable). Most
of his vehicle mode extras either make themselves part of the robot mode
(the chest, the roof on his back) or enhance the silouhette of the mode,
as is done with his side door-wings behind his upper back. However, despite
their interesting transformation, on his lower legs he's left with rather
substantial chunks of the back end of his vehicle mode sticking out below
his knees, which is pretty much my only deduction for him in this respect.
I do love how he's got wheel heels, though I wish that another flap flipped
out to provide him with more substantial heels, as he is slightly back-heavy
in this mode. His coloration is a bit more diverse here, with black, red,
and gray/silver making themselves more known. The gray plastic is of that
ugly milky type, though it's a bit darker than most of the milky gray plastic
used in TFs and thus doesn't bug me quite as much. The silver paint used
on some of his guns looks superb, though, and other little paint apps like
the red toes and black-and-red waist help keep Skids from looking like
he's missing some needed paint here. What's the most impressive aspect
about this mode is definitely the weaponry-- as (again) is fitting given
that this is
    <i>
     More Than Meets the Eye
    </i>
    Skids, he's got a LOT of weaponry,
particularly for a deluxe figure. His shoulders flip open to reveal missile
pod detailing in each, four barrels swing out from behind his midsection
to poke out in between the sides of his head and his shoulders, and there's
two additional gun barrels that rotate up from underneath each of his fists.
Add his gun(s) to all this and Skids looks PUMPED and ready to take on
just about anyone. This said, there are a few downsides to all this weaponry--
with everything deployed, if you look at him from the side there's a definite
gap in between the front of his chest and his back, though that's only
unsightly at very select angles. A bigger issue is that all the flip-out
weaponry really interferes with articulation in his arms. Technically,
Skids can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, waist, hips
(at two points), knees, ankles, and at the tips of his feet-- which sounds
pretty good when listed, and for the most part IS good. However, his shoulders
are very restricted when it comes to anything but forward-back motion,
with the main connection point only being able to move side-to-side a bit
and the connection point where his shoulders meet his red mid-arms being
so restricted as to be almost nonexistent. As such, this quite limits Skids'
arm poseability to levels that I'm generally not used to on mainline deluxe
toys, and is a bit of a bummer. If you keep his missile pods hidden, it
also makes his shoulders/upper arms look even more stiff, another bummer.

    Generations Skids may
be a bit of a departure for fans who solely want a Skids that's a strict
G1 update and instead is "just another Autobot car"; that said, his
    <i>
     More
Than Meets the Eye
    </i>
    design is quite interesting, and the myriad weaponry
this new version of Skids has really makes this deluxe a lot more noteworthy
than "just another Autobot car". I wish his vehicle mode had a few more
paint apps, but generally his design is quite well-done and sticks out
on a shelf in robot mode-- his overly restrictive arm articulation in robot
mode is the only thing keeping him from receiving a "must-buy" rating of
9.0+, but I'd still recommend him, particularly to
    <i>
     More Than Meets the
Eye
    </i>
    fans.

      With no memory of his life before a
few cycles ago, Autobot Skids finds himself with a rare opportunity. Not
knowing who he is allows him to be anything he wants to be, and the firepower
of his mysterious new blaster gives him the strength to follow through
on any adventure he pursues.
