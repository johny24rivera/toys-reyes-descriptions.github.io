    The Activator version
of Starscream's vehicle mode has some caveats that I'll get to in a moment,
but overall it's nearly as good as the
    <a href="anistarscream.html">
     Voyager
class version
    </a>
    of the figure-- which is pretty impressive for a toy
of this scale. The proportions are pretty much spot-on, and Starscream
certainly lacking in paint apps-- he's got plenty of dark red and black
paint to break up all that dull blue. (That said, he still does look rather
dull, and I'll never understand why all the Animated Starscream toys are
a light dull blue when his show model is definitely more of a dull gray
coloration.) His golden Decepticon symbols on the wings are the Movie Decepticon
symbols and not the "traditional" design, oddly enough. He's also got two
flip-out landing gear near the rear of this mode-- something rather unexpected
for a toy of this scale, so that's pretty cool. There is one major complaint
I have about this mode, however, and that's that the robot arms are incredibly
obvious on the underside of the wings-- heck, the hands even stick out
blatantly from the back. His feet are also rather obvious sticking out
from the backside, but that's obvious on the Voyager class toy as well,
so I suppose I can't fault them for sticking with the traditional design
in that aspect. Activators Starscream does have some noticeably improvements
over his Voyager-class self in this mode, though-- for one, his null rays
are placed more appropriately, and are also sized better proportionally.
There's also not as much noticeable undercarriage junk (though still some),
and I actually like the light orange-painted cockpit, I think it looks
more eye-catching than the transparent orange on the Voyager class figure.

    By pressing down on
the red tab in the middle of Starscream's vehicle mode, he shifts into
robot mode almost entirely automatically-- all you have to do is straighten
out the shoulder pads and feet, and turn the null rays around. Surprisingly,
Activators Starscream is a noticeable improvement over his larger toy in
robot mode in almost every aspect. The proportions are a tad better, with
bulkier upper legs and more lithe lower arms. He also doesn't have some
easily-broken-off tiny wings on his back, and the wing assembly as a whole
sits behind his body in a much more show-accurate manner than on the Voyager
toy. His null rays also look like they do in the show and aren't positioned
near his hands this time around. He's also got more dynamic triangular
shoulders, compared to the too-small shoulders on his larger self. In addition
to having no vehicle mode extras that negatively impact this mode's look,
Activators Starscream also has plenty of good articulation, as well-- he
can move at the neck, shoulders, knees, hips, and knees, and all of these
are on ball joints so you can get some really good motion out of him. His
null rays can also rotate-- something the larger figure can't do.

    Activators Starscream
is quite impressive for his size class, and actually outstrips the larger
Voyager class toy of him overall in robot mode. And even in vehicle mode,
he just barely comes up short (due to the obvious arms). If you don't mind
the scale difference, I'd recommend this version of Starscream over the
Voyager class toy any day-- it's just noticeably better and more show-accurate
in robot mode.

      Sneaky, mean and ambitious would be
a bad combination of personality traits in anyone, but in a giant robot
warrior bent on conquering the universe, they're the worst. Starscream
loves power for its own sake, and will blast anyone who gets in his way.
There's no reason he does all the awful stuff he does, except that he thinks
he's so much better than everyone.
