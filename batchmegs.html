    The only bad guy Battle
Charger to get a toy is, appropriately enough, ol' Megs. What's rather
surprising about Megatron's tank mode is that, even given the "superdeformed"
proportions parts of it have (the turret, in particular), it actually does
a better job of looking like a
    <i>
     tank
    </i>
    than all the "actual" transforming
toys of the character. The turret is far too shallow and doesn't "stick
up" from the main body nearly as much as it should, but really other than
that it's unmistakably a tank-- albeit a futuristic one, of course. For
a Battle Charger Megatron has quite a bit of mold detailing on-- pretty
much all the major details are there, without going overboard and making
him so chock full of circuitry and little armor plates and whatnot that
it looks like overly "evil". The gun doesn't fire-- given the very young
age these things are aimed at, of course-- but the end of the turret is
made of rubber, so no safety concerns there. (I do wish the turret could
turn, but understand why it can't given the target audience.) What is
    <i>
     really
    </i>
    cool is that the wheels on the bottom of Megatron's plastic tank treads
actually turn clockwork-like gears on the sides of the vehicle. The hideously
cute pseudo-robot face on the front end that serves as Megatron's "bumper"
is just
    <i>
     wrong
    </i>
    , though. There's cutesying something up for little
kids and then there's THAT. Ick.

    The whole Battle Charger
gimmick has to do with pulling the toy back and letting it go-- it'll travel
forward for a while, and if it bumps into a wall (or if
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    you just press in on the front bumper),
the upper part of the vehicle will rotate around, revealing the upper half
of Megatron's robot mode. What's rather odd is that as over-the-top cutesy
as the made Megatron's face in vehicle mode, other than being a bit bigger
proportionally his robot head and detailing is pretty darn accurate to
the movie design! He's definitely the Battle Charger character to recieve
the least-obvious cute-sification, here. This is emphasized by a REALLY
nice black paint wash over his head and main body, revealing all the great
little details packed into his robot mode, making his vehicle mode look
simplistic in comparison. It honestly would surprise me if it was revealed
the same sculpted both the vehicle and robot parts, the overall look is
so different. His right arm is, appropriately, his arm-cannon while his
left arm is more normal. Unfortunately his robot parts are that blah light
milky gray that's so common with TFs nowadays, as opposed to the much more
eye-pleasing duller metallic gunmetal gray used for most of the vehicle
mode (which goes quite well with the black and bronze, too). As far as
articulation goes, like other Battle Chargers, due to the transformation
Megatron can move his lower arms inwards a little and his head down a little,
but they immediately spring back to their default position once you let
go.

    Megatron is probably
the strongest Battle Charger mold there is, although given how similar
the design is for all of them that's not saying much. If you particularly
like the bump 'n go gimmick, or your young one needs a bad guy Battle Charger,
Megs might be worth a look, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend even the
best mold in this sub-line to your average Transfan, given its target age
range.

      Megatron just might be the most powerful

him drive, and his warrior's Spark makes him indestructible.
