    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
jet. This mode, surprisingly enough, is pretty good! Very convincing, with
no very obvious robot extras. Sure, it's a bit "kiddy" in its style, but
hey, it's a Happy Meal toy, I'm willing to give it some leeway there. Unfortunately,
the head cannot turn side to side, although it can turn up and down. The
detailing is pretty good in this mode too, although some more paint detailing
on the main part of the jet would have been appreciated.

    Robot mode is decent.
It's rather sad that the Happy Meal toy is the most show-accurate out of
all the Beast Machines Jetstorm toys, though. I like how they tried to
make Jetstorm look "skinny" in this mode by making his sides transparent
plastic. A rather creative touch, there. The paint detailing is also surprisingly
well-done in this mode- for a Happy Meal toy, at least. However, the arms
look pretty cruddy, and it's very clear that they're just the wing halves
of the vehicle mode. The single "leg" of Jetstorm is done pretty well,
though- just turn the plane neck around, and voila! It's a bit stubby at
the end, but still alright. Jetstorm's "spark crystal" is smack dab in
the center of his chest, you can't miss it. The Vehicon symbol's a bit
hard to make out, though. One thing added to this mode is that you can
split the cockpit in half if you want Jetstorm to stand up by himself.
He looks rather stupid this way, though, so I'd prefer to leave him in
his "hover mode" if I were you.

    A surprisingly well
done toy- however, it's still a "free" Happy Meal toy, and as such, it's
not exactly a work of art.
