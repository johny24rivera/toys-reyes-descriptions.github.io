    Underbite's vehicle mode
is... a thing. With four wheels. That's really about as descriptive as
I can be about it; not only is it very abstract/futuristic, but it's not
a very "solid" vehicle mode, with the four limbs from robot mode quite
obvious. It looks like Underbite's robot mode lying down with a few more
things collapsed together-- which is exactly what it is. I don't mind futuristic
vehicle modes-- heck, I love 'em-- IF they're convincing and not just the
robot mode lying in some weird position, and this vehicle mode is definitely
one of the latter. However, to be honest, most of it is accurate to the
show, so there's that, at least. The biggest departure from the show model--
and, indeed, the biggest issue I have with this mode-- is that the front
cockpit only covers up the very front of Underbite's robot face. It's plain
as day, right there on the rear section of the body, and is just a real
eyesore. There seriously couldn't have been panels that slide forward from
the sides of the front cockpit piece? Ugh. The highlights of this mode
are the colors-- the dark purple coloration used for nearly all of Underbite's
plastic is a really nice, attractive shade, with a bit of swirly glitter
in it to make it semi-metallic. The silver and red bits on the front and
along the sides of the main body (because of the obvious robot head) provide
a bit of additional contrast, though black-- used on the wheels, as a metallic
shade on the cockpit, and a few other minor areas-- is a bit too dark to
really stand out against the purple. Particularly on the cockpit, it blends
in too easily. As with most RID2015 toys, Underbite's mold detailing is
fairly minimal, with a few polygonal "divots" on the sides and tires, and
some rectangular shapes on the cockpit; otherise he's fairly smooth.

    To transform Underbite
to his robot mode, simply press his rear hips together. As a result, the
cockpit folds down to become the stomach while the head folds forward and
up and the legs move downwards. Push in on the hips again to transform
him back. An *IMPORTANT NOTE* here, however-- although it's not universal,
it's quite common on this toy for small pieces in the interior to become
out-of-alignment after a couple of transformations, making Underbite essentially
stay in vehicle mode, with his cockpit piece rather loose. Unfortunately
I haven't heard of an easy way to tell if you're getting a "good" version,
or an easy fix-- if you take apart the toy to try to fix the problem there's
a TON of springs and little bitty pieces of plastic inside, so that is
NOT advised. The first Underbite I bought had this issue, though the second
seems to be okay (though I'm not messing with him a whole lot to test this
extensively). The end result is a rather unconventional robot mode, which
is my favorite part about Underbite-- he's some kind of "chompazoid", in
that he grows stronger by eating metal. He looks more like some kind of
robot dog, honestly. Anyways, his legs are a little stubby and small proportionally
compared to the show model (particularly the back legs), but otherwise
this mode is by far the stronger of the two-- appropriately-sized shoulders
and hips, and the cockpit makes for a pretty nice chest/stomach. The head
is also sculpted very well, with a large... well... underbite, fierce-looking
eyes, an odd diagonal skull, and a large red/black "pivot point" for his
jaw, and sharp-looking, ferocious teeth. The silver paint on the teeth
also looks great, as does the light red on the eyes and jaw. For articulation
in this mode, you can move either of his front legs front-to-back at the
shoulder, and unexpectedly, there's a little tab on the back of his head
that allows you to move his jaw up and down (though if you let go of the
tab, the jaw locks back into its default position).

    The 1-step version of
Underbite has a nicely-sculpted head and fun chomping gimmick, as well
as an EXCELLENT main plastic color and a very unique "robot" mode. Unfortunately,
he has some big downsides, the most notable of which is a transformation
that often can get stuck, ruining the toy without any easy fix. Even if
you do get a "good" one, the vehicle mode is still very obviously his robot
mode laying down with a cockpit in the front, not really looking like anything
with an obvious head, and given his huge size in the show a regular-sized
1-step toy doesn't do him justice. Only recommended for absolute completists,
which I hate to say because I love the character.
