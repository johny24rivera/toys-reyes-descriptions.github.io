    Like the other "Flip
and Attack" vehicles from this
    <i>
     Amazing Spider-Man
    </i>
    subline, the vehicle
mode for this version of Spider-Man is only just barely passable as a vehicle.
It's supposed to be a race car, and to be fair, it does fit the general
(VERY general) vibe; the back having a "tailfin" of sorts, the four wheels,
the partially enclosed cockpit area near the front. However, it doesn't
take a genius to figure out that it's just the mech mode with its legs
lifted up and locked in, and then with the toy put on its back. The mold
detailing on the vehicle parts is a bit minimalistic, but on the parts
that are mean to visibly become Spider-Man in mech mode, there's a pretty
decent amount of detailing there, what with the "web stripes" on the sides/arms
and such. (The back side-- which becomes the bottom of the feet in mech
mode, oddly enough-- has some of the most intricate mold detailing on the
figure.) I do really wish that this mode had real (black, not dark gray)
wheels on the side-arms, thogh, and not just the little wind-up wheels
on the underside of the body.

    Speaking of the little
wind-up wheels, they're central to the gimmick-- like all of the "Flip
and Attack" figures, wind Spider-Man back in his vehicle mode on a flat
surface until you hear a clicking sound on the wheels, then let it go--
the legs will flip forward abruptly a couple seconds later, the weight
and torque of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Spider-Man stand
up into his mech mode on his own. It only seems to happen about 1/3 to
1/2 of the time in my experience, though-- the other times he just unfolds
and rockets forward a bit to clatter around on his front or backside. When
it does happen right, though, it's a pretty awesome little gimmick, and
one that had its origins way back with Topspin and Twin Twist, the "Jumpstarters"
from the beginning of the G1 Transformers toyline. Unfortunately, the rest
of the sacrifices made for this gimmick haven't aged that well over time--
Spider-Man's feet are too big, and he only has two points of articulation--
backwards and forwards at each shoulder. (He can also move foward a bit
at the waist due to his gimmick, but the legs snap back into their default
position as soon as you let go of them.) I understand why his legs have
to be locked in place for the gimmick, but would some elbow or head articulation
have killed the designers? Anyways, the paint detailing becomes more apparent
in this mode, with the classic "Spidey-suit" dark blue down the legs and
sides of the main body, helping to bring some needed color variation to
a toy that had little in vehicle mode. The Spider-Man symbol on his chest
is outlined in black and looks as cool as it ever has, and the light copper
paint on the eyes also looks great; combined with the couple of silver
bits on the shoulders and legs, it helps to drive the point home that this
is indeed a Spider-Man mech, not the actual character in some weird robotic
form.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The "Flip and Attack"
figures are definitely made with a market in mind that skews younger than
your more involved Transformers toys, and the gimmick certainly takes away
a lot from the vehicle mode and a fair amount from the mech mode as well.
However, that said, the gimmick IS pretty cool when it works, and kids
who don't care about things like articulation will probably like this guy.
It also helps that this is the only Flip and Attack figure that actually
has Spider-Man's normal colors, which I'm sure a lot of people will care
about more than I do. I think the vehicle mode is probably the weakest
of the three Spider-Man figures in the subline, though.
