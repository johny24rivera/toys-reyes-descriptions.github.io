     "General" Optimus Prime
is an homage to a cancelled toy from late in the Generation 2 line-- it
was never actually produced, but a painted sample was found in an image
in a '95 Sears catalog. Talk about obscure! As with multiple Optimus Primes
in G2, this version of Optimus doesn't really look like Optimus at all,
and was actually a redeco of a G2 Decepticon dump truck toy, originally.
Obviously he's not a dump truck this time, though the mold's nearly square
outline in vehicle mode makes for a semi-decent replacement. In robot mode
he looks slightly more like the unreleased General Optimus toy, with a
somewhat similar headsculpt (by coincidence, as it's unchanged from Roadbuster's),
albeit one that's more square than the rounder version of the original.
The chest is also fairly broad, and the legs share some similar details,
but this is definitely more of a stretch mold-wise than Sgt. Hound, even
if you ignore the lack of a new headsculpt on Prime. General Optimus' color
scheme is mostly a fairly dark dull military green, which actually works
much better on a military-esque vehicle than the dump truck alt mode of
the original. There's also a lot of light milky sparkly gray-- I'm not
all that fond of this color, but the copious amounts of glitter in the
plastic does make it catch the eye at least slightly, and I can't deny
it contrasts well with what is otherwise a fairly dark color scheme. In
keeping with the gray, there's also a pretty decent amount of silver paint--
on the lower legs, as well as the front bumper and winch in vehicle mode
and on the arms and shoulder launchers in robot mode. To serve as a dark
"neutral" color, there's a fair amount of black on General Optimus Prime
as well, from obvious places like the wheels and missile launcher to the
feet, knees, and some other small parts like the hips and other minor details.
To fit in with his whole "military" theme, he's also got a good number
of "camoflauge" brown paint apps in vehicle mode-- however, this brown
is a bit too pale, to the point where it doesn't really contrast against
the dark green as well as it should have-- it reflects light too easily,
and should have been either considerably lighter or a bit darker to really
work, in my opinion. In fitting with Sergeant Hound, his transparent plastic
is a rather nice shade of light orange, and he has a bit of yellowish orange
paint on the rear side windows. He also has the G2 Autobot symbol along
with the word "AUTOBOT" on the rear sides of the vehicle mode/lower robot
legs in this color, which looks kind of weird by today's criteria but was
pretty standard back in the G2 days. There's also an army star and "ARMY"
script in the middle of the vehicle front hood/robot chest, partially copying
that same detail from the original cancelled toy (though "U.S." prefaced
"ARMY" on the original, and is not the case on this exclusive). With the
various color and paint apps, there isn't one large section of General
Prime that is too one-tone, but I do really wish his face had gotten some
paint apps-- it looks too plain as-is.

     General Optimus Prime
is a neat nod to an obscure unreleased toy, and I'm always happy to get
something like this in my collection-- particularly since, given its appearance,
it's anything but "another Optimus Prime". I also don't mind the changing
of the alt mode to something more military, as it suits the character and
color scheme much better. All this said, I think a few minor balls were
dropped, such as the shade of brown used for the camo paint apps and the
amount of light milky gray on the toy. He also could've really used a new
headsculpt, since as-is he looks too much like Military Camo Roadbuster
in robot mode. Whether I'd recommend this to you depends pretty much solely
on whether getting a "modern" version of a previously unreleased obscure
toy/character variant appeals to you at BotCon exclusive prices.

       Confrontation with Megatron in Sector
49G required thicker armor and massive firepower to combat the Decepticon
leader's own upgraded flight mode, rapid launch Destronium Missiles, and
lightning speed when combined with Lieutenant Starscream. On Mirtonia at
the outer reaches of the Decepticon Star Empire, what became the final
battle between Autobots and Decepticons raged savagely. The Decepticons
laid waste to city and structure, but General Optimus Prime and his Firestormer
Squadron of Sgt. Hound, Air Raid, Strafe, Jetfire, and Autobot Jazz stood
fast and valiant. The fighting edged towards yet another stand still until
an errant missile slammed into a refinery processing an experimental form
of energon. The resulting explosion vaporized Megatron, Starscream, and
Communications Officer Soundwave while ripping a hole in reality that General
Optimus Prime and Sgt. Hound tumbled through.

       Rebooting in Axiom Nexus, General Optimus
Prime soon found himself recruited into The Convoy-- a group of heroic
leaders meant to safeguard the entirety of the multiverse. While the others
of the Convoy stayed in the upper city of Axiom Nexus, the General used
his unusual appearance for a Prime for missions into the Low-Tech under
city. This access to that populace also made him a valuable tool for Transtech
Security Administration Officer Cheetor.
