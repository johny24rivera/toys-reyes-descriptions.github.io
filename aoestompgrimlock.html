    Every line has its big-ticket
item, and "Stomp 'n Chomp" Grimlock is Age of Extinction's. Basically,
he's a super-huge (close to 2 feet long in dino mode from head to tail),
super-simplified one-step changer with a bunch of electronic features.
As far as t-rex mode, in general he LOOKS pretty good, except for two rather
significant robot mode extras-- the robot arms and chest plate, hanging
below his chest and going back below his stomach. They're pretty darned
obvious, though their rounded nature at least makes them fit in with Grimlock's
silhouette from certain angles. However, otherwise the proportions on this
mode look pretty nice. As huge as the toy is, the mold detailing isn't
super-intricate, but there's still lots of awesome bits like bone-like
ridges along his tail and upper back, spikes-a-plenty along his feet, plenty
of fearsome-looking teeth inside his maw, and those crazy-looking eyes
and little "demon" horns that are a trademark of AoE Grimlock. The color
scheme isn't a surprise if you've seen any other mass-release AoE Grimlock
toys-- Stomp 'n Chomp Grimlock has the same largely bronze-and-dark-gray
color scheme, though there's quite a lot of metallic bronze paint on him--
the head, the upper back, and the upper legs are all covered in it, and
it looks pretty good while also being close enough in color to the brownish
bronze plastic to complement it. The dark gray, medium gray, and charcoal
black are largely "meh" colors, serving as an okay secondary color I guess,
but I think a more "pure" black or a more metallic shade of gray-- like
the metallic gunmetal paint used on the trigger-gun on his back-- would've
worked much better visually. As far as articulation goes, this is where
Stomp 'n Chomp Grimlock REALLY fails. I understand that certain simplifications
have to made to make him a one-step changer, but not including hip, knee,
and ankle articulation is absolutely inexcusable on this large and expensive
of a toy. He can't even close his mouth-- so how exactly can he "chomp"?!
(The halves of his lower jaw also have an annoying tendency to become unpegged
and make it look like his jaw is broken-- easily fixed, but still annoying.)
He also has no action features in his feet, so he can't "stomp" either!
His t-rex arms are also utterly static. As far as electronic features,
though, Grimlock's got plenty. For one, he comes with a miniature Optimus
Prime figure (I say "figure", but it's really a plastic little statue)
that can "ride" him on his back. The figure itself isn't much to talk about--
it's more of a "temporary accessory" so that the gimmicks can still function
if you don't have any other one-step changers or Power Battlers. He can't
move at all, and although his mold detailing is fantastic, his dark blue
and red paint on him is pretty bare-bones and he looks rather crummy with
all that unpainted gray plastic as a result). Back to Grimlock-- open up
the painted parts of his upper back to reveal little spots for Optimus
to put each leg (he doesn't fit securely there, though-- there's nothing
to hold him in there). Here is Grimlock's central gimmick-- EVERY Power
Battler and 1-step changer in the entire line has a magnetized "button"
on one of their feet-- most Autobots have it on the bottom of their right
foot, Decepticons on their left. Put an Autobot on the top of Stomp 'n
Chomp Grimlock, and a gun (with an Autobot symbol behind it) will unlock
from the right side behind where they stand, with some "shooting" sounds
emitting from Grimlock as his eyes glow green. Once activated, Grimlock
will occasionally growl and make other metallic t-rex noises, though if
left alone for a while he'll turn himself off. If you use a Decepticon
to ride him, a rotary gun barrel (with a Decepticon symbol in it) will
unlock from the left side, and Grimlock's eyes will glow red while missile-firing
sounds are emitted. If neither weapon is activated, his eyes will glow
orange. The Optimus figurine that comes with Grimlock has magnets on the
bottom of BOTH feet, though, so he can activate both gimmicks simultaneously.
(You CAN activate either weapon with another 'bot from any allegiance,
though- you just have to turn then around and magnetize the correct trigger.)
If you hold down on Grimlock's main trigger and push it down slightly,
Grimlock's whole body will slouch, his mouth will open up a bit, and he'll
make a "fire breathing" and roaring sound while the interior of his mouth
(the back of his robot head) glows red. You can also push up on a small
button consisting of his front upper teeth to activate a quick "chomp"
noise-- I guess THIS is what Hasbro meant by "'n Chomp", even if his mouth
doesn't actually close for the noise.

    If you hold down the
main trigger and pull back, Grimlock will basically auto-transform into
robot mode, which basically means he stands up, his arms fold out, and
his dino jaw halves split behind his shoulders. It's not the most elegant
transformation, but it largely accomplishes what it's supposed to. Grimlock's
proportions are nice and beefy in this mode, with nice, thick arms, a wide
chest, and the aforementioned jaw-halves on his shoulders. He does have
a bit of obvious kibble, though-- most egregious is the top half of the
dino head sticking right up behind his robot head. There's also the dino
arms sticking out of the tops of his robot shoulders, and of course his
dino tail sticking out his butt. There are some nicely-detailed parts in
this mode-- the head in particular is VERY nicely-detailed with AoE Grimlock's
half-mask, half-tooth mouth displayed prominently, and the fake dino teeth
"frame" his chest nicely-- but by and large Grimlock's mold detailing is
a bit overly simplistic, particularly on the arms. Granted, he does have
the appropriate armor-plating-like detailing, but I wish it was a bit more
intricate. His waist and stomach also could use some paint, being all brownish
bronze or dark gray plastic. For articulation, Grimlock fares SLIGHTLY
better in this mode, but not by much-- you can move his arms at the elbows
at two points, and his shoulders can move outward, though they spring back
into their default position as soon as you let go of them. Again, having
no hip/knee/ankle articulation at this scale is absolutely unacceptable,
1-step changer or no. Wrist articulation would also have been greatly appreciated.
One can also more easily see all the hollowness of Grimlock's legs in this
mode, which just looks... well, cheap, and like size was more of a factor
in his design than a good, quality toy. Factoring into this are Grimlock's
electronic sounds/lights in this mode-- he makes the classic G1 transformation
noise when you transform him into this mode (or back into dino mode), but
it seems like Grimlock SHOULD be able to move one more click back-- his
chest and shoulders look like they need to spread apart just a bit more,
but they don't stay quite in the position you think they'd be. The transformation
also sounds VERY easily in this mode and is often interrupted mid-sound,
strengthening my hypothesis that his upper body was meant to move back
one more click. His robot eyes now glow, and he'll say random things like
"GRIMLOCK!", "DESTROY!", and various other metallic growling/roaring noises.
You can activate them manually by pressing in on the little button on his
dino mouth mentioned earlier, or just wait a minute or so as he says a
few random phrases before turning off. Unfortunately, that's it as far
as gimmickry in this mode-- none of his allegiance-activated features carry
over to this mode. He DOES have a transparent yellow sword that you can
take out of his tail and slide into one of his hands, but it seems a bit
overly stubby even considering the younger audience this toy is aimed at,
and it's a bit small proportionally too-- still, it's certainly better
than nothing.

    Stomp 'n Chomp Grimlock
is a pretty massive disappointment, in all honesty. He's got some neat
detailing and does LOOK good (for the most part) has an admittedly neat
allegiance-activated action feature in beast mode, but electronic sounds
aside he's far too hollow and unacceptably brick-like in his poseability
for such a large toy, simplified or not. Plus, some central features--
like his transformation and accompanying sound effects-- don't even work
completely correctly! This toy is absolutely not worth $80, regardless
of the size. If you have a young'un who LOVES electronic features and Grimlock,
at a steep discount I could see this being a purchase. Otherwise, avoid
and get one of the cheaper simplfied Grimlock toys like the
