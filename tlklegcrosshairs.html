    Crosshairs' legion toy
looks fairly accurate to his Chevrolet Corvette Stingray alt mode in the
movie-- keeping in mind the limitations of this small size class, of course.
The major details like the slanted headlights and grill, the "vents" in
front of the rear tires, and even the fairly long side mirrors are present
here. It does fail a bit towards the back end, as he's lacking a spoiler,
plus the back end really only has the taillights on the side; due to the
transformation, there's just very visible balljoints and the top of his
chest back there. His color scheme is fairly accurate, being a moderately
light green on the sides and black on the top and rear portion of the front
hood. I do wish the windows were a different color-- at least slightly--
to help bring them out against the black top, though, and the decorative
patterns on his sides are missing, definitely giving him a bit more of
a plain feeling. The only color other than these two visible in this mode
is a silver Autobot symbol near the front, which honestly should've been
a bit darker to contrast against the green better.

    Crosshairs' transformation
is pretty simple, and is actually fairly typical for Legion-class car TFs,
but in reverse in orientation, with the feet being near the front and the
head towards the back end. First, fold up the hood and then fold it back;
then fold out the sides to become his arms, split apart the front portions
and fold down his feet, and then open up his chest and flip out his robot
head before closing it. The end result is surprisingly accurate, at least
for the body and legs. He has a slightly-simplified version of his "crumpled
car hood" for the chest, along with a decently-sized waist with some black
paint apps. His legs are the best part, working as his "hood trenchcoat"
really well, despite only the wheel sections on the side actually being
made from his actual car front. The upper sides of the trenchcoat are painted
a nice black to make them look like faux windows, and his legs on the inside
are actually separate pieces, with the flip-down, toed feet being accurate
to the model but also long enough to keep him stable (the back ends of
said feet are the halves of his car grill). His headsculpt is generally
accurate, with the goggles on his forehead and othewise "normal" face,
but only the face is painted silver (and the eyes blue)-- no black paint
for his goggles, unfortunately. Something about the head seems a bit "off"
as well-- it seems to be a titch too long in the face. The sides of the
car form okay arms for the side, but as usual for Legion-class toys with
arms made from the sides of the car, they're a bit 2-D, not being thick
enough from a front view. The entire top of the car also just sticks behind
Crosshairs' back. I guess it's their attempt at making it the back of the
"trenchcoat", but honestly it just looks like a huge panel behind his body
for no reason; the only trenchcoat-looking part is the upper legs. Articulation-wise,
Crosshairs can move at the shoulders, hips, and up-and-down a bit at the
ankles-- more-or-less average articulation for a Legion. (Yes, it does
look like his legs can move at the knees as they're bolted there, but apparently
that's just to keep the inner and outer leg parts together-- no movement
there, unfortunately.)

    There are a few things
I believe Hasbro could've done better-- such as a few more paint apps in
vehicle mode and less of an obvious extra "shell" on the back of the robot
mode-- but otherwise, Crosshairs is a fairly well-done version of the design
at a small size. Not amazing, but he'll do if you like toys at this size.
