    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Deluxe
Jazz toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Unlike the
     <a href="fabsmokescreen.html">
      Fast
Action Battler Jazz repaint
     </a>
     from the first movie, which is almost a
color-for-color duplicate of
     <a href="g1smokescreen.html">
      G1 Smokescreen
     </a>
     ,
this version of Smokescreen still has the general "red/blue" color scheme
of his G1 counterpart, but it's considerably more subdued. The vast majority
of his vehicle mode is a dull navy blue, and honestly doesn't look all
that exciting. Near the rear end, though, there's a pretty cool deco job
of two diagonal silver lines above red triangles that start at the bottom
of the car door. Unfortunately, I think it covers about half as much of
the figure as it should, unfortunately. The other main color besides the
dull navy blue is black, and though they certainly don't clash, the two
main colors just don't catch the eye at all like the perhaps-too-primary
FAB Smokescreen's colors. In robot mode that same silver/red color combo
is in a more fragmented form on his legs, to make it seem like it was formed
from the rear part of the car mode. This looks mighty cool, and again,
it's a shame it doesn't cover more of the figure like the upper body.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     RotF deluxe Smokescreen
is a decent alternative if you absolutely cannot stand the simplicity of
Fast Action Battlers, but generally his color scheme is waaay duller and
more boring than his TF1 version. And as for this mold, it's not the worst,
but it's not the best color scheme either, so you might want to think this
one over and make sure you're one who likes duller color schemes before
picking this guy up.

       According to Smokescreen, the only good
Decepticon is a totally confused one. He does his best to make sure that
the Decepticons never know what his teammates are up to. He's perfected
the art of creating diversions, using traps, holograms, and strategically
placed explosives. When all else fails, he uses himself as bait, often
racing right through a group of enemy robots to distract them.
