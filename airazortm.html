    Beast mode is a metallized
hawk. This mode looks and is large for a deluxe, and looks a lot better
than the original Airazor. Very nice colors, but her robot chest on her
underside sticks out a lot and her robot legs stick out of her back and
look odd. The detailing is only so-so in this mode as well, most of it
concentrated on the feet and silver plating.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Vehicle mode is a hawk
with pontoons sticking out from under its wings and turbo engines exposed
from its shoulders. This isnt much of a vehicle mode; all it looks like
she can do is land on water and fly without flapping her wings now. Still,
considering few of the Transmetals' vehicle modes are very good, this one
is average.

    Robot mode is very nice-looking,
with a very cyber-organic body. She now looks more like a female than her
original mode. There are a lot of extras in the back, though, like her
eagle wings and engines. Although they dont get in the way a lot, they
are bulky and make it hard for her to stand up on just her robot legs.
She has bird talons on her hands that look like machine guns, and, although
the instructions dont say this, her pontoons can become transformed to
look like guns.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    She has a special mode,
shield mode, in which her top eagle plates fit over her chest to make
her look like a giant shield with a head and legs. Although hard to transform
into, due to the fact that you have to position the hands just right, this
mode is very nice.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    A nice transformer overall,
and large for a deluxe, although a bit extra-heavy in robot mode. Recommended.

      A quantum surge has completely rearranged
Airazor's structure to include a metal-armor coating and a pontoon plane
substructure that provides the added advantage of sea reconnaissance. Already
quick as lightning, her twin jets furnish extra high-level acceleration
and agility. Her optical matrix scanners can detect Predacon ground movement
from 30,000 feet while her armor-ripping talons send fearful sparks through
the Predacon army.
