    Beast mode is a crocodile.
The detailing is pretty good in this mode, but the articulation is pretty
limited. Only the mouth and front legs can move. Also, the robot hands
are clearly visible on the back of the front feet, and the back legs are
too small proportionally. One of the more serious flaws of the toy, however,
is not apparent by looking at it, or even after you buy it. After a while,
the tab that holds the tail in place may wear a bit, and, since the tail
is what activates the spring-loaded transformation, you may eventually
be stuck with Megatron in robot mode.

    Robot mode is okay,
but has some extras. His crocodile back is sort of large. Also, his crocodile
feet stick out of his legs and make them look awkward. His tail can become
a gun, though, and his face is very nicely detailed. It is a bit hard to
take the tail off of his back, though- you really have to pull sometimes.

    A nice start for the
Beast Wars, but not the ideal toy.
