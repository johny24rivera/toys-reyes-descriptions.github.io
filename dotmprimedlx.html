    Welp, it's official;
movieverse Optimus Prime now has a unique toy mold for every single size
category there is. Now as a deluxe, Optimus shares the same movieverse
vehicle mode he's always had-- a Peterbilt truck with flames on the front.
The proportions in this mode take a little bit of a hit due to the transformation
and (relatively) smaller size, though-- the back end "bed" of the truck
is noticeably too long proportionally, and thus the rear tires a bit too
far apart from the front. The central section (which becomes his waist
and upper legs) also dips down ever-so-slightly below the plane the tires
are on, interfering with Optimus rolling along a flat surface smoothly.
The front section of this mode looks great, though; Optimus Prime has the
great flame paint apps he's always had along his nose, and the gold paint
fade along the front looks particularly stunning on this version of the
toy. His side steps, fuel tanks, smokestacks, and wheel rims are also painted
silver, along with his front grill; lacking in paint this toy isn't. The
mold detailing is also quite crisp, and the windows are clear (though you
can't see seats or anything inside of them; in fact, they're mostly obstructed
on the inside by gray plastic). There are some minor robot mode extras
visible, like the fists partially visible from the back side of the main
body of the truck, or the feet from certain low angles on the very back
end (which is, unfortunately, partially hollow), but neither of these are
that big of a deal. There's also a bit of a gap in the middle about two-thirds
down the length of this mode, due to them separating into Prime's legs,
but again-- not that big of a deal from most angles. Optimus Prime has
two Mechtech ports, both next to each other on the top of the roof. His
Mechtech weapon is pretty much a carbon-copy of
    <a href="dotmmudflap.html">

    , with the yellow a bit more orangish on the axe. It's certainly
an appropriate Mechtech weapon for Prime given the whole "axe" thing, but
I would've liked it if he had gotten his own unique weapon for this mold.

    Despite how many toys
movieverse Optimus has gotten, this version still has a rather unique and
fairly innovative transformation, being slightly more complex than it would
look at first glance (but not what I would call hard, in any case). The
result is a remarkably movie-accurate robot mode with half of a truck on
its back. Now, there are of course limitations of how accurate the toy
can be at this scale, and to "only" end up with a truck nose on his back
at the deluxe scale is still pretty good; nevertheless, it is there and
quite obvious, though it pegs into place on his upper back somewhat, isn't
floppy, and stays out of the way of articulation. (Because it's merely
a shell of his truck nose, it also doesn't weigh that much, so he's not
as backheavy as you might think). Optimus Prime's core robot mode proportions
are SLIGHTLY on the "leggy" side, but still quite good, with no other proportional
maladies afflicting him. The excellently-sculpted head (with blue light
piping) and chest pop right out from in between the truck windows, and
his arms look quite good too with the blue flaps serving as "shoulder armor"--
though I do wish said arms had a bit more paint on them, as being solidly
gray plastic they're the only part of this Optimus toy that looks rather
dull. Optimus has excellent articulation-- he can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows (at three points), slightly forward at the waist (due to his transformation),
and movement at the hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and side-to-side
motion at the ankles to help keep him steady. It should be noted that due
to his transformation, his knees can be a bit fiddly and don't lock into
place all that well, though it's a minor annoyance at best. Prime keeps
the two Mechtech ports (now on his shoulders), and his fist holes can hold
Mechtech weapons, as well.

    Deluxe DotM Optimus
Prime does a remarkably good job at replicating the movie design in both
forms at the scale, with my only real complaints being that the back end
of his truck mode is too long and his lack of a unique weapon for himself.
However, as good of a mold as it is, I just question the
    <i>
     need
    </i>
    for
it. At a deluxe scale, it's too small for "regular"-scaled movie TFs and
too large for Cyberverse-scaled TFs. As such, if you really want this mold
I'd get one of the more uniquely-colored later releases of it as opposed
to this "normal"-colored version, which is bound to be redundant for the
vast majority.

      Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots,
earned the right to be called a Prime by virtue of his courage, intelligence
and skill in battle. But the discovery of the long-missing Sentinel Prime
means he may have to share his role as commander. The Decepticons don't
stand a chance with these two mighty Autobots fighting side by side!
