    Optimus Prime's first
larger foray into the Prime toyline-- which, of course, makes it a bit
hard to classify him, being a "Prime Prime" and all-- ends up with a truck
mode with elements of both his G1 and movie designs in it. It's a long-nosed
truck cab, like his movie versions, but it forgoes the flashy flame paint
job in favor of a more by-the-book "Optimus" color scheme of simply being
mostly a dull red in the front and a dark blue in the back, with various
shades of gray/silver and black making up his secondary colors. It's not
the most exciting of color schemes, but of course, it IS classic Optimus
Prime, so it's hard to fault the designers there. What I'm not fond of,
though, is just how blah and dull the light milky gray plastic is, particularly
on his smokestacks (which are made of bendy plastic, by the way, but still
peg into place in both modes) and on his front grill. It just doesn't look
remotely metallic; I would've preferred silver paint at least on the grill.
Some of the black plastic, however, does have quite a lot of silvery "glitter"
to it, so that looks pretty nice. I do wish there were more varied paint
apps for a bit more visual interest, however. Proportionally, for the most
part this mode is good, but on the sides of it, something's just... off.
I think it's the midsection; it looks a little squashed before it comes
to the truck nose, not being quite as wide and slightly taller than you'd
think the truck cab would be. You can also make out the upper robot legs
somewhat obviously in between the midsection and the back blue area of
the cab, though it's fairly minor compared to how often Optimus toys have
really obvious feet back there (this one certainly doesn't). I also appreciate
the addition of a fold-out "trailer hitch" piece-- it totally wasn't needed,
but it helps the back end look less like his two robot legs compressed
together, and that's appreciated. Prime's two weapons can store in the
peg holes on the top of the back end, making them fairly obvious but also
relatively out-of-the-way. (Since his sword is made of soft, malleable
plastic, though, it doesn't stay in its hole as easily as the gun does.)

    The transformation to
get Optimus into robot mode is a bit tricky, particularly for a toy from
the Prime toyline-- especially when it comes to how to configure his arms
when getting him into vehicle mode. Once you get it down though, it's totally
worth it, and some of his transformation steps are just wonderfully done
(such as the back half of his midsection separating off and combining with
his blue pieces to form his legs, or his arms and back pieces all coming
together to peg into his shoulder-wheels, which are, in fact, the actual
wheels from his truck mode). Optimus' proportions in this mode are nothing
short of extraordinary, mimicking his show CGI model almost exactly (with
some minor extra kibble on the back, though this kibble also fragments
in a diagonal manner just like his front mold detailing, and thus I actually
sorta like it that way). He's a tad leg-gy as Optimuses often are, and
he's broad-shouldered with arms that are strong-looking but not too buff,
as well as a wide chest with an excellent, spot-on headsculpt that captures
Prime's personality in the show perfectly. The rest of the mold detailing
is fantastic, as well-- in vehicle mode it's a little on the low end due
to the style of the show and the CGI model (with rivets being the only
notable details in many cases), but here you can see all sorts of pipes
and tubes around Optimus' neck, and a good amount of angular robotic detailing
on his chest and waist, including fake "truck bumper halves" for pecs.
I do find it odd that-- despite his real truck windows being on his robot
chest-- his transformation involves folding fake, larger truck windows
over those windows, though. His colors are also broken up a bit more here,
particularly with the use of a dark dull brown. I feel a dull silver or
gunmetal would've worked better and been more show-accurate, but this still
doesn't look all that bad as a secondary color. (His arms really could've
used some of that silver, though-- the're pretty much entirely lacking
paint apps). For articulation, Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points, though his "shoulder flaps" also move to get out of the
way of articulation), and at the elbows (at two points), rotational movement
at the wrists and waist (though if you rotate the latter much, it looks
weird, given that the center of rotation is off-center for his transformation),
and movement at the hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles
(at two points). Given his balanced stance, this means Optimus is VERY
poseable, and has all the articulation you could reasonably want on a toy
of this size, other than the ability for his head to look up much. Prime's
weapons, though simple, are quite well-done; when he holds either his gun
or his sword in one of his hands, it looks similar to in the show when
he "converts" a hand into one of these weapons; alternatively, you can
combine the two weapons to form a bayonet-like weapon, though the sword
peg-- because it's that bendy type of plastic, held in up-side down into
the gun peg hole-- doesn't stay in all that well.

    The First Edition voyager
version of "Prime Prime" is excellent nearly all around. His robot mode
is practically flawless and excellently replicates his show model in a
manner you wouldn't have thought possible, his articulation is excellent,
he's got some fairly nifty (if simple weapons), and for the most part his
vehicle mode gets the job done with no kibble, either. I'm not a fan of
the "squished" middle version of his truck mode, but if you don't mind
that and also don't mind more complex transformations, this is a must-get.
This is
    <i>
     definitely
    </i>
    the "definitive" toy of Optimus Prime in the
    <i>
     Prime
    </i>
    TV show for Seasons 1 &amp; 2, especially when it comes to the robot mode.
