    As opposed to his inaccurate
    <a href="springload.html">
     1-step
changer
    </a>
    , this time around Springload's vehicle mode is accurate-- it's
an old rickety pickup truck! From an initial glance, this mode is fairly
decent-- the proportions are fairly spot-on, and most of the necessary
molded-in details are here. Beyond the basic details like the windows and
the treaded tires, his front grill is also detailed in, along with little
bitty rear-view mirrors, the RID2015 signature trio of divots along the
front sides, wheelcovers, and taillights on the rectangular back end. The
color breakup is also good-- VERY good for a Legion-class figure, in fact.
Springload's basic light milky forest green color is present, offset and
contrasted with a good amount of black on his tires, wheels, and painted
on his windows and wheel covers. His front roof is covered with a darker
forest green that complements and contrasts against the lighter green quite
well, and there's a bit of fairly light blue on his roof that serves as
another light color. There's also a bit of silver on the front grill, but
unfortunately only the top, not on the black-plastic portions of it further
down. However, all of this said, there is some kibble in this mode, some
of it significant. The most egregious is the top of his frog head sitting
back there where the truck bed should be. If it was unpainted it would
actually fit in somewhat well, but given that the eyes are painted a dark
red and his eyebrows are painted a dark glossy purple they stick out quite
bit. There's also some obvious fake tires in this mode-- used for his frog
mode-- that are easily visible on the sides of his truck bed. The black
circular-like bits underneath his side windows aren't tires, but kinda
look like them they even though they're hinges used for the transformation
and are a bit unsightly. On a lesser note, the tips of his rear front tire-feet
peek out just a BIT below the bottom of the truck, though this is more
looking for issues at this point.

    To transform Springload
into his "robot" mode-- really a robotic frog-- you fold back the rear
sections to reveal the complete frog head, then unfold out his long front
legs fron underneath the truck while rotating up his jaw from inside the
body of the truck to underneath his head. The front section of the truck
mode also folds back in a similar manner as the back sections, making Springload's
smaller rear frog legs visible and hiding the front tires at the same time.
The end result is quite accurate to the show, particularly for a Legion-class
toy. Yeah, there's a bit of truck mode kibble on his shoulders, but this
is there on the show, just not quite as bulky. Same goes for the front
top of the truck mode that's used for the main body-- I actually don't
have a problem with this latter "kibble" at all, seeing as how it's used
so well as Springload's body. In a definite contrast to his 1-step changer,
Springload's headsculpt this time around is definitely spot-on to his show
model, and his mouth can freely open and close too. (The tiny teeth are
even painted white!) His long front legs have some stylized claws on the
front, and are mostly painted light blue, giving him some more contrast
on the front. His rear legs are molded into the typical "frog crouch" position,
with faux wheels forming the feet, and look pretty decent back there, even
if they're a little undersized compared to the front legs. Once again the
faux wheels are a bit of an oddity here, as show-wise they're accurately
on his shoulders but due to the toy size/limitations his real truck wheels
are hanging off his lower front legs, which looks kinda odd. Other than
that though, getting something this accurate to the show in a Legion-class
transformation is pretty cool. For articulation, Springload can move up-and-down
at the jaw, as well as the shoulders (at two points), elbows, and two points
at the hips-- pretty decent for a small frog figure, overall.

    Springload is my favorite
Legion-class design in the entire RID2015 line. Yeah, the top of his head
being right there in vehicle mode is a definite eyesore, and some of the
fake wheels are a bit weird, but this is such an inventive design in basically
all other aspects those are easily overlookable, in my opinion. He's got
a smart, interesting transformation-- especially for such a small toy--
with both a unique old-timey vehicle mode and a VERY unique frog robot
mode. His color scheme is also incredibly varied for such a small toy,
his proportions are pretty good, and his articulation isn't anything to
sneeze at either. My only real regret about this toy is it makes it obvious
how making the toy a bit bigger-- say, Warrior-class size-- would have
enabled Hasbro to get rid of some of the minor oddities from the truck
mode, most likely. I really wanted a bigger accurate Springload, but this'll
still do.
