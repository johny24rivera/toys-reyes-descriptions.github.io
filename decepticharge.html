    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Windcharger.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Windcharger

     Decepticharge was originally
supposed to be Drag Strip, a G1 Decepticon with similar colors, but somewhere
along the line the name got changed for some reason and we know have the
first Alternator with a completely original name. Regardless, the yellow-and-black
color scheme, though not exactly a new scheme, works well enough since
it's not a bright shade or anything like that. The silver and gray secondary
colors also help to give Decepticharge a bit more variety, though I still
would have liked at least one more major secondary color thrown in the
mix. The metallic yellowish gold used for the car roof and the "4" on the
front hood, however, is a noticeably different shade than the yellow plastic
used for the rest of the car, which can be slightly distracting. As for
the remolding done, the robot head has been changed, for one-- it looks
a bit nicer than the Windcharger head, I think, a bit more steamlined while
still looking like this Decepticon means business. Unfortunately, his head
can't tilt up much like it could on Windcharger because of the more elongated
head structure. A rear spoiler has also been added to the car mode (which
breaks in half and folds onto the sides of the stomach in robot mode),
and the detachable convertible roof cover has now been remolded into a
"normal" car roof. Decepticharge still comes with the same "retracted convertible
roof" piece that Windcharger did, which is odd since this model of car
doesn't have a retractable roof, not to mention it looks odd to have a
convertible with racing logos on the side. And speaking of the racing logos,
while I certainly don't mind the flaming "4" on the car doors and the "4"
on the front hood, the other logos are obviously fake and not real corporate
sponsors. I wouldn't care about something like that if it was on a mainline
Transformer, but again, Alternators are all about the realism, so I think
fake sponsorship logos are a bit of a no-no on these toys. Though at least
the fake logos are nice (and sometimes obscure) Transformer nods; "Dinotron
Racing Fuel", "Hyperlinq Racing", etc.

     Alternator Decepticharge
is a pretty good remold, but I'm not too fond of the fake racing logos,
and although the new color scheme is still good, it doesn't quite measure
up to Windcharger's, so I'd have to recommend Decepticharge's predecessor
more.
