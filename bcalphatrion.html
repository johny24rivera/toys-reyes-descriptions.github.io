      Beta Maxx's color scheme
is primarily the same as Alpha Trion's (a by-product of being part of the
same mold), but with some gold and less red. The light purple and white
go together extremelyt, and Beta Maxx has quite the number of paint apps
on him for a Minicon-- in addition to his large gun being painted, he's
also got quite a few nice gold paint apps on his wings and chest, and his
head is painted a nice dark red that contrasts with the otherwise light
colors and helps to make it stand out more. (And on a side note, LOVE his
name-- it sort of follows Alpha Trion's name in style, and he's a recorder
of data, so... hehheh.)

        Alpha Trion continues
Beta Maxx's really nice color scheme of light purple and white, but given
his size, of course adds a few more colors to the mix. He's got a TON of
dark red paint apps on him that really go incredibly nicely with the light
purple, and it's a rather original color combo, too. Really the impressive
number of paint apps on this toy cannot be overstated, it really just brings
out all the mold detailing so well. The transparent purple used on such
areas as the wings and the sword is also a near-perfect shade (though if
I had to get nit-picky, I'd say they could be slightly less red and more
purple). His Cyber Key is also a nice light gold color like the gold on
Beta Maxx, which works well with the purple.

        Of course, what will
be the primary interest to most people is the new Alpha Trion-y headsculpt,
and it's fantastic, one of the best Fun Publications has ever done. The
proportions are perfect and spot-on Alpha Trion, the only real difference
being a shorter robo-beard because of the transformation. He's also got
a lot of paint detailing on him, including two small dots of colors that
aren't anywhere else on the figure-- dark blue for the eyes and light red
on his forehead vent. Little details like that are always neat, I think.
The downside to this new headsculpt, however, is that it's very obvious
in vehicle mode, as it's not as angular as Vector Prime's face and thus
doesn't mesh with the surrounding vehicle mode parts.

          Just like the Alpha Trions from other
continuities, A3 seems to possess much knowledge and has a great understanding
of the Universe and the Transformers' role within it. His constant companion
is a small robot possessing many of the traits of the super computer Vector
Sigma. A3 has been an advisor to many Transformers, a role he is both comfortable
in and suited for and even in old age there is still more than meets the
eye to this battle hardened Autobot. Not much else is known about him,
but for three travelers, the information he has is of great importance
and they long to find out more of what he can offer them.

          Given that both Alpha
Trion's and Beta Maxx's color schemes really stand out and, homage aside,
are just fantastic-looking, it's hard not to highly recommend this set.
Alpha Trion's awesome new head sculpt and the high number of paint apps
are just icing on the cake. Highly recommended, if you can afford 'em.
