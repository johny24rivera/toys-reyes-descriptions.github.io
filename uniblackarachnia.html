    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Blackarachnia.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Blackarachnia

     If you've been reading
my toy reviews for a while, then you'll know that I think the purple/orange
color scheme is a great combo that is under-used. So it should come as
no surprise that I'ma diggin' Blackarachnia's new colors. The silver accents
also add magnificently to the overall appearance of the toy. Her spider
head is still a transparent color, though, which I think was stupid enough
on the first toy, so I'm not too happy about it being that way again. At
least it's a better color, though. Oh, and I don't know how to say this
without it coming out the wrong way, so I'll just say it. I can't stop
staring at Blackarachnia's butt! Naw, not like that, man. Her "energon
radiation" pattern is absolutely beautiful. It's a silver crooked streak
that runs across her rump, between the two transparent globes on either
side. It has a lovely reddish purple border which looks so beeeautiful
combined with that silver. Mmmmm.... Wish that lime green was a couple
shades darker, though.

     Blackarachnia has a
great new color scheme, and an excellent energon radiation pattern. She's
still got a couple of small quirks color-wise, like that odd bright lime
green, but otherwise, she's a winner. Recommended over the original Beast
Machines Blackarachnia.

       Reformed from her Predacon history of
treachery and double-dealing, Blackarachnia became a Maximal largely thanks
to her relationship with the noble Maximal known as Silverbolt. Under the
command of Optimus Primal, Blackarachnia proved herself in the battles
to liberate Cybertron from Megatron's tyranny. Following the Maximal victory
and reformatting of Cybertron itself, Blackarachnia enjoyed a brief spell
of peace and happiness with Silverbolt by her side. However, due to the
machinations of Unicron, Blackarachnia has once again been corrupted, this
time siding with a renegade Decepticon faction loyal to Unicron. In spider
mode Blackarachnia can scale any surface, is extremely agile and is invisible
to all scanning equipment. She can spin webs for a variety of uses both
offensive and defensive. Her metal-deteriorating web nets deflect energy
pulses, while web based throwing stars explode to ensnare their target
upon impact. Two stinger legs disrupt/overload all but the most heavily
shielded electronic systems. Can ground herself with legs and use stingers
to send electronic pulses through the ground towards enemies. Six eyes
can see into the infrared spectrum.
