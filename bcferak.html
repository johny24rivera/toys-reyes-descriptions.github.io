    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Cyclonus w/
Nightstick. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe

     Ferak is a member of
Squadron X (a sort of Decepticon version of the Wreckers), and in a somewhat
recent (very brief) comic appearance he looked remarkably like Cyclonus,
so it makes sense that FunPub ran with that and redecoed Cyclonus into
him. Following his comic appearance, Ferak has a color scheme of mostly
white and gray (a bluish gray is used for most parts, but a lighter shade
of the color is used for a few minor pieces, like his fists and feet).
By itself, this color scheme is pretty boring. Thankfully, there's a fair
amount of dark red paint on Ferak, which helps to spice up his color scheme,
especially in robot mode where the red paint on his toes, knees, lower
arms, and chest is more apparent (there's also some red on the "side blasters"
on his nosecone and on a stripe on each side of said nosecone). The red
provides excellent contrast, especially against the white, and helps keep
Ferak from being monochrome. Ferak also has a decent amount of black--
mostly on some connector parts, but also on his abs and windows-- which
provides some contrast and a nice dark color for the scheme, but otherwise
just fits in with the whole "monochrome" theme he's mostly got going. Given
that this version has left the Decepticons to join the Star Seekers, Ferak
has some white Star Seeker emblems on his wings, though he's still got
a small Decepticon symbol on his forehead. The red on the face... again,
it's comic accurate, but I'm rarely a fan of red used on the face, and
Ferak is no different. The orangey yellow eyes look pretty good against
it, though.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     As for Ferak's little
buddy Tornado-- that was the name of another member of Squadron X-- he
looks nothing like Tornado from his brief appearance in the comics. It's
mostly a "name slap" since they gotta call the Targetmaster mold that comes
with Cyclonus something, I guess. The bluish gray takes up more of a dominant
color on Tornado, but the white chest and black shoulders help provide
a bit of contrast, and his head is well-detailed with a silver face and
orangey yellow optics.

     No mold changes have
been made to Ferak or Tornado.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     BotCon 2014 Ferak is
my least favorite figure from the boxset. He's a solid mold, to be certain,
but his color scheme-- though comic-accurate-- is mostly dull, with only
the red here and there really making him look somewhat interesting. He
also could've really used some more paint apps on the main body of his
jet mode, it's too plain there. Tornado is also largely forgettable, and
without at least SOME other Squadron X members as toys, Ferak's appeal
seems rather limited, in my opinion.

       As the last known survivors of Squadron
X, Ferak and his diminutive partner Pirate Tornado have run from system
to system trying to avoid prosecution for their prior crimes. They were
fortunate to find much needed safe harbor with the Star Seekers. Having
been branded as part of the crew, they currently pledge their allegiance
to Captain Cannonball.

       Ferak is an accomplished engineer and
inventor. If his creations were not so sadistic in nature, they would be
revered by the Autobot Science Council. His alternate mode is a hunter-seeker
skyship, self-equipped with a heavily modified built-in deuterium-based
electrochemical laser. Tornado is a saboteur by trade and backstabber by
his own Cybertronian genetics. He has pledged his life to reforming his
traitorous ways, but still keeps a personal log filled with "profitable"
information that can be accessed at any given time or situation. Tornado
despises his alternate gun mode due to its tendency to jam, caused by a
faulty energy transfer conduit in his power processing unit. Ferak has
replaced this component multiple times but has yet to determine the root
cause of the failure.
