    Mold History
   </b>
   : Dark Scream's mold
was originally used for Beast Wars Transmetal 2 Nightglider, which came
out in 1999.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Nightglider Transmetal
2. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Nightglider Transmetal
2

   <p>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Dark Scream's color scheme
completely differs from his predecessor, Nightglider. Dark Scream has a
mostly "arctic" shade of colors, mostly light blue and silver being the
main ones. Although it would work on some animals, it really doesn't fit
a flying squirrel that well at all. Have you EVER seen a squirrel with
a color even CLOSE to pale sky blue? Dark Scream also has slightly more
paint detailing than Nightglider, but it's nothing substantial; just a
little extra stuff around his beast mode eyes and on his robot mode waist.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes were
made to this toy, so it retains all the negatives and positives of Nightglider
in that respect.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although Dark Scream
isn't a BAD toy, he's not really a GOOD one either. And Nightglider has
a better color scheme, in my opinion.

       (NOTE: When transforming Dark Scream, ALWAYS move the head through the
neck slot BACKWARDS! It will not fit if this is not done!)
