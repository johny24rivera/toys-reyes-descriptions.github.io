    Brawl's alt mode is a
hover-tank, and like most other "Fall of Cybertron" toys, it takes a few
design liberties with the design of a tank. Unfortunately, in this case
those design liberties are the downsides to this tank mode. There's a big
square gap in the front of the tank, which you'd have to imagine Brawl
getting stuck on things all the time as he's hovering forward; also, looking
at it from a straight-on frontwards angle, you can see the black fists
and back of the robot head because of this large gap, too. (The fists are
the bigger offenders, being obvious from more angles and in different colors
than the surrounding plastic.) The back half is also a bit incomplete;
there's a similar gap in the middle (though not as big as the one in the
front), though this is a bit easier for me to give Brawl a pass on since
that's where his combiner port folds out of. Other than those two notables,
this mode is pretty good; the turret looks nice, angular, and awesome,
as a FoC toy should, and the way his little hand-held gun from robot mode
fits into a hole in between his two main tank barrels to effectively form
a third barrel is a pretty neat idea. I also love the illusion of treads
on sides of the front half, though I wish this had been extended to the
back half, as well. Brawl's main color is-- just as is the case within
the video game-- green, though it's noticeably lighter on the toy than
in the game. This is likely because the other mass-retail Combaticons have
colors homaging Energon Bruticus Maximus, and instead of just homaging
his game appearance, this color scheme primarily homages

    , who also happens to be primarily green. Still, a bit darker
of a shade really would've helped him look better and less plain, particularly
in this mode. There's a fair number of paint apps on the main body of the
tank, such as the black treads, gunmetal gray rear thrusters, and a couple
other random dark green and gunmetal gray paint apps, but his turret is
utterly devoid of said paint apps, and it REALLY needs some with all the
awesome mold detailing going on up there. (The main body of Brawl's tank
mode, by comparison, is a bit sleeker and has less mold detailing on it.)
There are no little wheels on this tank to roll it along; it just sits
on a surface with Brawl's chest basically forming the bottom. (The turret
can rotate, though, if you had any doubt, though it can't move up or down.)

    Brawl's transformation
is pretty simple, mostly consisting of simply folding out his arms and
legs and standing him up. The result looks admirably like the game model,
keeping in mind that A. Brawl was in the prequel game to FoC, so his design
likely was considered with even less of an emphasis on eventually making
it into a toy than most of the other FoC Combaticons and B. the usual budget
and combiner toy issues. His main body is definitely the best-looking part
of him, with some nice crisp detailing on his stomach and waist (and some
nice gunmetal gray-painted springs below his chest). His head sculpt is
also pretty darned good, and the yellow on his visor really pops well;
I wish it had been used as an accent color in a few other places. Unfortunately,
he's got a bit of back kibble. The turret on the back is pretty much Brawl's
thing so I won't ding him there, but his combiner peg piece and his rear
thruster piece both just hang off the back of his butt unceremoniously
and is distracting. His arms and legs are pretty serviceable, but they're
definitely too skinny for a beefcake like Brawl, and thus don't give him
the "oomph" visually that he's ideally supposed to have in this mode. His
hollow lower legs also don't have heels, which is a surefire recipe for
having a toy that can topple over backwards easily. For articulation, Brawl
can move at the neck (though his head collapses back into his chest VERY
easily, so I tend not to touch it much), shoulders (at three points), elbows,
slightly at the wrists, and at the hips (at two points), knees, and slightly
at the ankles. His arms are annoyingly hollow from many angles, though,
and as mentioned before, his stablity isn't the best, so his articulation
is a bit less than you'd think from that description, particularly when
it comes to the lower legs.

    FoC Brawl is decent
in both modes, but he has enough issues (odd gaps in tank mode, some kibble
and proportional problems in robot mode) that keeps him from being particularly
great. About average for a FoC Combaticon mold; out of the various releases
of this mold, this is the color scheme I like the least.
