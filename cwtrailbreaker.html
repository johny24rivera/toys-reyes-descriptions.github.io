    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Offroad.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Combiner Wars Offroad

     no longer-- Hasbro finally has the rights to the "Trailbreaker" name back!
He's another remold of the pickup truck Offroad mold, and the alt mode
suits him well-- slightly better than it does

      Ironhide
     </a>
     ,
methinks. As is usual, his main colors are black and red-- it's a pretty
basic, but effective color scheme. Unfortunately, his red is solely visible
in robot mode, which makes his truck mode a tad plain. Luckily, there's
some good paint apps to help break up this monotony some-- he's got some
a REALLY nice shade of light blue paint used for his windows that contrasts
beautifully with the black (though the rear window isn't painted blue,
natch). He also has the Trailbreaker-usual diagonal little stripes along
the sides, with a white stripe going down the truck doors horizontally
with a cool mix of light yellow-to-orange-to-red stripe patterns on his
truck doors and near the front sides of his truck bed. These really help
spice up the middle of the vehicle mode in particular, though Trailbreaker
also has some silver paint, as well. It's on his wheel hubs in addition
to his front grill and headlights, axe blade, lower arms, and on the piston
details on his lower legs as well as on the fingers of his hand/foot/gun
accessory. Unfortunately, many of his best paint apps aren't visible in
robot mode-- particularly on his chest, he could've used a few more paint
apps.

     Trailbreaker does have
a new headsculpt, more blocky and "G1-ish" than his "Thrilling 30" toy.
It's still a good sculpt, though I dislike that only his blue visor is
painted; his face really needed some silver, as well. In addition, the
details on his lower robot arms have been remolded-- one of them into a
gun, with a standard port for the barrel in an homage to how his G1 toy
could look. It's a pretty neat feature, and allows him to hold his hand/foot/gun
accessory in hand mode in his normal robot mode, like
     <a href="cwrook.html">
      Rook
     </a>
     .
That said, there is a slight downside to this-- the back side of the gun
does stick out a bit obviously on the top of the truck bed in vehicle mode,
made all the more obvious because it's painted silver. Surprisingly, Trailbreaker's
hand/foot/gun accessory has also been remolded slightly-- the fingers and
thumb have been remolded to be more angular and simple, with him having
only two thick fingers compared to the usual four! It's a nice extra little
touch, and helps to differentiate him from Ironhide and Offroad a bit more.

     Trailbreaker is a nice
addition to the "Combiner Wars" line, fitting the pickup truck mode rather
well and having a decent number of paint apps to break up most (but not
all) of the black on him. I also really appreciate not just the expected
remolded head, but the remolded "gun-hand" and hand/foot/gun accessory
that give him a bit more uniqueness in this last wave of the line.

        The upbeat personality of Trailbreaker
masks his own issues with his self-worth. As one of the least fuel-efficient
Autobots, he constantly wonders how much even his best efforts are "costing"
the Autobot cause. This doubt is completely unfounded, as his talents are
unique and borderline irreplaceable. His magnawheels allow him to move
along walls and ceilings, and his ability to generate powerful force fields
has saved hundreds of Autobot lives. The quad-barreled mega blaster allows
him to project his force field in vehicle mode as well, and his battle
axe allows him to live up to his namesake.

         The unhappiness of Trailbreaker has
been his lone weakness. He even changed his name once to appear more confident.
His fellow Autobots trust and support him, and his inclusion on a new Combiner
team shows how important he is to them. Forms either an arm or leg of Sky
Reign, the new combined form of Sky Lynx.
