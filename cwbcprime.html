    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Combiner Wars
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     One version of Optimus
Prime for Combiner Wars isn't enough! This "upgraded" version of Optimus
Prime is the one that actually appears in fiction (the IDW comics), and
features a color scheme that seems to be a bit of a nod to Nova Prime,
the evil old Autobot leader in said IDW comics. (What that portends for
Optimus is... well, nothing, it's an homage that lasts a comic or two before
he reverts to his old color scheme.) Regardless, Battle Core Prime's general
color scheme is a bit more monochromatic than Optimus' usually is-- he's
mostly white, with a good bit of light milky gray in there as well. The
placement of the white honestly reminds me of
     <a href="cwmagnus.html">
      Ultra
Magnus
     </a>
     , though this certainly isn't meant to be him-- though with all
the sticker sets that let you "re-appropriate" this figure as someone else,
you can certainly try to make him Magnus if you want to! The light milky
gray is unfortunately that bland, non-metallic shade of plastic it usually
is, though just a bit darker (i.e., slightly better, in my opinion). By
itself, this would be a boring color scheme-- it's the metallic paint apps
that really help this color scheme, the gold in particular, which is found
on the legs, arms, abs, head crest, the real and "fake" truck fronts--
it's used on pretty much every part, albeit generally in small amounts
on each part. I wish it had been used more liberally to give the color
cheme a bit more "pop". The windows are painted a silvery blue-- an okay
color for windows by itself, but I would've preferred something a bit lighter
to complement Prime's color scheme. As it is, it just blends into the gray
a bit too much. Same with the silver paint on places like the front bumper/headlights
and portions of the torso mode upper legs. Same GENERALLY with the metallic
gunmetal gray paint on things like his weapons and front grill, though
it's difficult for metallic gunmetal to look outright bad, it just looks
"sameish". The light blue eyes on the robot and combiner heads really pop
against the white, and is another color I wish had been used more.

     Surprisingly, Battle
Core Optimus Prime DOES have a new head sculpt-- it's meant to be an homage
to Star Convoy, complete with Prowl-esque headcrests and more details on
the "helmet" around his core face &amp; faceplate. It looks pretty good,
particularly with the gold paint-- better than the original CW Optimus'
headsculpt, methinks. (Unfortunately, the combined mode head is the same.)
The misaligned ratchet problem has also been fixed for this release of
the mold.

     Battle Core Optimus
Prime works okay as a "powered up" version of regular Prime-- or even can
pass as Combiner Wars Nova Prime-- but generally, despite this version
having a more original color scheme, I like the original CW Prime's colors
better. The gold spices things up a bit, but generally the color scheme
for this version of Optimus is a bit too monochromatic for my tastes, without
enough other colors.

       With Decepticon super robots threatening
to pound cities - and even entire civilizations - to dust, Optimus Prime
masters the power of the Combiners to stop them. Together, he and the Autobots
will prove that courage is stronger when combined.
