not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Megatron's pre-Beast
Wars form is, fittingly, a bit honking missile launcher. Guess he must've
missed the huge gun when he got his beast form, eh? Anyways, the color
scheme is definitely 100% Megatron, though the amounts of the colors are
changed a bit to make the colors more suitable for a vehicle. Granted,
light purple isn't the first color I'd pick for a military vehicle, but
it's not the last, either. There's plenty of Megatron's trademark light
purple, with the amount of dark purple used being a bit less than on the
     <a href="megatrex.html">
      original toy
     </a>
     . There's also green used, but
substantially less of it this time-- there's only a few light green spots
visible only in robot mode, though the transparent part of his big cannon
is a nice forest green color. The new color to be used in a much greater
amount on this toy is a purplish shade of black, which works with the other
colors quite nicely-- probably more than straight black would have, in
fact. Red and silver are the other two accent colors used, and they help
to give some lighter colors to this otherwise mostly darker-colored figure.
Overall, all of the colors fit together very well, and my only real complaint
regarding any of them is that they aren't the most suitable for a military
vehicle, as said before, but this is hardly something the designers can
change when Megatron's colors were already pretty much picked for them--
they worked well with what they had. A little interesting nugget of info--
the "MGT-1" on the side of the vehicle mode is an obscure nod to Larry
DiTillio (I BELIEVE, but it could have been Bob Forward), one of the main
story editors on the Beast Wars TV series, who said-- unofficially, mind
you-- that "MGT" was Megatron's pre-Beast Wars name, as he supposed they
all had "machine-like" names before they acquired beast modes.

     Megatron is one of the
lucky ones to get a head remold, which is pretty much spot-on with his
original Beast Wars head. All of the mold and paint details are in the
right places, however, there's something odd going on with the eyes. They're
far too long, they go almost halfway to the back of his head! I'm not sure
what the person that carved the head mold was thinking when they did that,
but it looks rather weird and off a bit. Of note is that the electronics
in Cybertron Defense Red Alert have been scrapped for this toy, to keep
the costs from getting too astronomical. Also, like most of the other exclusives
at this year's Botcon, the Cyber Key used in the Cybertron version has
instead been replaced with a solid gray Planet X Key bearing a Predacon
symbol and a painted bit of Golden Disk detailing over the main part of
the Cyber Key, hence the new name "Golden Disk Key". Also of note is that
in addition to being a Botcon 2006 exclusive, you could only buy Megatron
for a whopping $95 with Waspinator at the convention-- it was not available
free to preregistrants or available at all to those who did not attend
the convention. Megatron is limited to 500 pieces, so he's worth a pretty
penny.

     Darksyde Megatron (so
named for the Predacon ship, which is now officially named) is a very,
very cool repaint of an already A+ toy, and as one of the most beloved
and unique TF characters to boot. Of course, he's very expensive, but out
of all of the Botcon exclusives released in 2006, I think he's the best.
The new head mold could use a little work, though.

       With the ratification of the Pax Cybertronia,
most Predacons laid down their arms to usher in a new era of peace. However,
there were those who would not bow down to their government's wishes and
struck out on their own to destroy the Maximal Imperium. Among the most
arrogant of these malcontents was a Predacon who assumed the fearsome name
of Megatron - a name that invoked fear within the ranks of the Autobots
for millennia. The legends of the ancient Decepticon leader's exploits
inspired Megatron to take up arms with his own small army of followers.
Megatron is extremely cunning and intelligent. He has extensive knowledge
of tactics and strategy owing to his time as a field commander in the Predacon
army. To augment his considerable strength, Megatron outfitted his basic
body-frame with an outer layer of transformable armor. This armor is lightweight
yet dense enough to resist all but the most powerful weaponry. While his
small band of soldiers pales in comparison to the Decepticon armies of
old, Megatron seeks to fullfill what he feels is the true destiny of the
Predacons and will stop at nothing to do so.
