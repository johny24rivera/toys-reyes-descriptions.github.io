    You probably know what
to expect from movieverse Bumblebee's alt mode by now-- he's a Chevrolet
Camaro, updated to the newest version as of the release of the AoE movie.
Proportionally, this mode is pretty much perfect, as licensed alt modes
tend to be; there's noticeable chunks sticking out behind the front wheels
that are due to the gimmick, but otherwise it's hard to find anything wrong
with the general look of this mode. There's no robot mode extras at all.
The color scheme is pretty by-the-book, too; Bumblebee is mostly an orangish
"cheesy" shade of yellow, which fits with most of his other AoE toys (though
on this toy the plastic is a tad more "milky" and "swirly" than on most).
The black main stripe down the top of this mode with a smaller "outline"
around it looks great, and most of the important details are painted--
the front grill is appropriately black, with silvery blue headlights, a
bronze Chevrolet symbol on the front, and some nice light metallic red
taillights. That said, the rear end is missing a bit of paint-- specificially
the exhaust pipes, license plate, and rear Chevrolet symbol are completely
unpainted, which is unfortunate but relatively minor given that all of
Bumblebee's windows are painted (yes, even the rear window). THe light
silvery blue used for said windows is the typical shade used for windows,
and it look great on 'Bee, keeping this mode from looking too two-tone
between the yellow and the black. There is one rather annoying bit with
this mode that stems from Bumblebee's transformation gimmick, though; the
back section of his robot mode-- made up of his front section (except the
wheels), the front windshield, and the front half of the roof-- doesn't
QUITE click into place, with a noticeable gap in between this piece and
the rest of 'Bee's vehicle mode. It's not HUGE-- maybe 1-2 mm, with it
getting worse as you go further down the vehicle mode-- but I really wish
there was a shallow peg or something to peg this section into so you didn't
have this odd gap. Granted, the intended audience for this toy probably
won't care, but it's still worth pointing out.

    Bumblebee's transformation
is pretty neat. Like the other Flip 'n Change car TFs, you open up the
sides of this mode (which form the robot arms), and then flip the whole
toy around the shoulders either forwards or backwards a few times, depending
upon which mode you're converting 'Bee into. The result is a toy that has
surprisingly nice proportions for a "gimmick" Transformer. Bumblebee's
shoulders are a bit broad and his arms a bit flat, but his head, chest,
and main body are very well-proportioned. His legs also look very good
from a front angle, though from a side angle they're a bit too flat and
thus a little too two-dimensional. Bumblebee's car parts hang out behind
his back, with the most noticeable piece being the front hood, which sticks
up rather obviously far back behind his head. This makes him rather back-heavy,
but he's got long heels, so he can still stand up fairly stably. This whole
bit is a pretty big piece of kibble, to be sure, but given how good the
robot general look is otherwise, it's not that big of a deal. He also has
the car doors above his shoulders, but I actually think this makes the
shoulders look a bit better, makes them look a bit "beefier". It really
should be mentioned just how stellar the mold and paint detailng on Bumblebee's
robot parts are; he's got tons of movie-accurate details all over him,
from the pistons on his abdomen to the fake vehicle front on his chest,
to the spot-on headsculpt, to even little bitty robotic details in little
seams on his legs (!). He's also got a good amount of paint detailing,
with silver and a dark shade of gunmetal gray-- nearly black, honestly--
helping to add some extra contrast, particularly on the head and chest
area. That said, the blue for his eyes should've been a bit brighter. Bumblebee's
big weakness in this mode-- as is the case with the other Flip 'n Change
toys-- is his articulation. He can move at the shoulders (at four points;
one of them is shared between both shoulders, meaning if you move one shoulder
up and forward the other will follow due to the gimmick), elbows, and slightly
at the wrists. Thus, other than the arms he's very much a brick in this
mode. Granted, articulation is not the point of this subline, but at least
knees or head rotation would've been appreciated.

    Flip 'n Change Bumblebee
certainly has his drawbacks-- he's got extremely limited articulation,
a big section of his car mode hanging off his back, and the front section
of his car mode doesn't QUITE sit flush with the rest-- but he's got a
really fun gimmick and generally nice proportions in both modes, especially
for a simplisitic "gimmick changer". His mold and paint detailing in both
modes is also done very well. If you're looking for an AoE Bumblebee toy
that's easier to transform than the deluxe version, this is the toy you're
looking for.
