    Windcharger's vehicle
mode is a Honda S2000 convertible. In most respects, this car mode is pretty
typical for an Alternator-- no robot extras whatsoever, realistic headlights,
adjustable seats, openable doors, rubber tires, and all that good stuff.
He's even got a little rubber antennae behind the seats! Windcharger is
also one of the few Alternators that has an fully openable rear compartment
in addition to his front hood opening. One thing I have to say I'm a little
dissapointed in when it comes to Windcharger, however, is that I was under
the impression that he had a fully collapsible hood-- like a little miniature
rubber cover that you could fold up over the seats. That would have been
very cool-- but instead, there are two seperate plastic parts that can
go behind the seats; a "hood down" piece and a "hood up" piece. And whichever
one you're not using at the time... well, you can't store it anywhere else
on him, so you're stuck with an extra part. And the "hood down" piece isn't
used on Windcharger's robot mode at all. I thought all this "extra parts"
business was supposed to end with G1-- it's rather annoying. Also, Windcharger
is a rather small Alternator. I mean, I know Hasbro wants to create all
of the Alternators to scale with each other, but still... you can't help
but feel that you're being ripped off a tad. But still, overall an excellent
vehicle mode.

    Windcharger's overall
transformation has some definite similarities with
    <a href="altsideswipe.html">
     Alternator
Sideswipe's
    </a>
    , so his robot mode has some of the same structural look
to it. But Windcharger improves on some of Sideswipe's main problems. For
one thing, Windcharger has almost no vehicle kibble-- a few pieces on the
sides of his legs are really about it. His front hood and windshield piece
rotates up onto his upper back, so it doesn't get in the way of much movement
there and stays out of the way. And, as you can see, the rear half of the
car splits and forms his arms. Windcharger still has the same oddly-proportioned
legs that Sideswipe does, however, which is a sizable drawback. They're
also pretty skinny when compared to his more solid upper body. But one
small improvement has been made in the legs-- they can now bend forward
and back a bit more at the knees, which was a definite problem with the
Sideswipe mold. As for his overall articulation, besides the aforementioned
point, he can move at the waist, head, shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), wrists, his index finger on each hand, his other four
fingers (as one piece), side-to-side at the kn ees, and inwards at the
ankles. But, unfortunately, Windcharger's feet aren't quite large enough
to keep him really stable-- it's not that hard to get him in a standing-up-straight
position, but if you shift any of his weight to one side, he'll topple
over. It's kind of a shame, given his great articulation. Another downside
is Windcharger's gun, which I suppose needs a bit of explaining. Hasbro
originally was going to make it a long-barreled rifle, but Honda, after
already AGREEING to have a Transformer made of one of its cars, stepped
in very late in the design process and got all antsy about a Honda TF having
a gun (Primus forbid!). So Hasbro really couldn't do anything else except
get rid of the rifle barrel. So now Windcharger is stuck holding an engine
in his hands. It's pretty lame... stupid Honda... But on the plus side,
I really like the mold and paint detailing on Windcharger's chest-- it
almost looks like he has a set of abs, given the lines on his lower stomach
and all-- some really nice detailing, there. I also like the design of
his head, even given the fact that it looks nothing like G1 Windcharger's--
it's kinda like a nice Starscream head with a red stripe down the middle
and a blue see-through visor. It's gives Windcharger a very "professional"
feel to him.

    Windcharger is still
a very nice toy, even if he's not one of the best Alternators. A few problems--
such as his legs in robot mode, as well as his neutered gun-- keep him
from entering the must-buy category, but he's still worth picking up if
you've already bought all of the A+ Alternators.
