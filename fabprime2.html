    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Power Hook Optimus Prime.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Power Hook Optimus

     This repaint of Prime
is most definitely a
     <a href="rodimusmajor.html">

     homage, particularly
in truck mode. The yellow flames, combined with the light orange and dark
red, look great together as they always have. They also make the toy look
considerably less dull than its original paint job, which consisted mostly
of dark colors. Oh, and hey, his truck mode's windows are actually painted
this time, like they should have been the first time around. The gray,
which is more apparent in robot mode, looks horribly out of place with
the otherwise vibrant color scheme, and is the only part of Fire Blast
Prime's colors that I don't like. The light and metallic blue looks really
nice, and helps establish the toy as still definitely "Prime" by having
both red and blue on it. I particularly like the metallic blue paint on
his head, that combined with the other details makes it look REALLY nice
and shiny. The orange flames on the red chest aren't nearly as obvious
as they should be, as both are dull colors and blend together too well
for the flames to really stand out, unfortunately.

     Fire Blast Optimus Prime
is an excellent repaint of the FAB Prime mold, superior in almost any way
and making the mold more unique from the other versions of Movie Prime
at the same time. The dull grey really doesn't fit the other colors at
all, but other than that it's a nice color scheme and a cool Rodimus homage
to boot. Recommended.
