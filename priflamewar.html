    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Prime legion class
version of Arcee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Prime
legion Arcee

     I love it when Hasbro
goes into the more obscure decos for repaints instead of a "Stealth/Jungle/Desert"
version of the same character, and Flamewar certainly fits that description.
Flamewar's
     <a href="flamewar.html">
      original appearance
     </a>
     was as a Botcon
2005 exclusive-- also repainted from another Arcee mold. This mold keeps
Flamewar's general "look" the same, while simplifying things a bit because
of the smaller size. The black that was on the original Flamewar is now
a very dark purple that honestly might as well be black unless it's under
a strong light. The only other plastic color here is gray, which admittedly
doesn't contribute much to the overall color scheme, even if it's an appropriate
color for the tires-- I would've preferred the red of the original to make
more of an appearance here, as opposed to just being on Flamewar's eyes.
That said, Flamewar's paint apps really help increase her visual interest.
Just like her namesake, she has a nice orange flame deco job on her vehicle
mode, and on her chest in robot mode as well, which fits given the "fake
vehicle front" molded there. The orange detailing on the front area of
the vehicle sort of ignores the headlight, though, and I wish it wouldn't
have since that's a fairly major detail-- this is a fairly minor issue
overall, though. Flamewar's also got a bit of silver paint for another
light color, which is on her windshield, legs, chest, and face. Combined
with the orange this means that no large section of Flamewar is too one-tone,
particularly in robot mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to Flamewar, though the Cyberverse weapon the mold comes with
has been switched up to the standard translucent purple "Vehicon blaster"
gun that is included with some of the other 2012 Cyberverse legion Decepticon
toys.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although there's a couple
of minor deco changes I would've done-- such as replaced the gray plastic
with a more vibrant blood red, just like on her Botcon 2005 toy-- Flamewar
is still an excellent redeco, albeit of a mediocre mold. If you're someone
who wants more Decepticon toys in your Prime collection or Botcon 2005
means something special to you, this is worth a pickup-- otherwise, given
the mold, you can spend your money more wisely elsewhere.

       Flamewar has spent years preparing for
the final battle against the Autobot Arcee. She has studied every one of
her enemy's moves, and devised a strategy to counter it. Now she waits,
her weapons ready, for the unwary Autobot to wander into her trap.
