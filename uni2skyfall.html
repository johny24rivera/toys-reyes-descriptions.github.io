    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Ultra Silverbolt.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe 2.0 Ultra

     Another obscure repaint
homage, huzzah! Skyfall here is a throwback to G2 Skyjack, a Cyberjet with
nearly the exact same colors. It's good to see they translate well to a
bigger toy-- the light red REALLY pops against the black and looks fantastic.
The bits of gunmetal gray--such as on the hands-- look fairly good against
it as well, though I'm glad to see it used as an accent color, considering
that as a main color it would look a tad dull. The gold is my favorite
of Skyfall's accent colors, and goes equally well with either the black
OR the light red. The transparent red cockpit in vehicle mode also makes
him look eeevil, too. Definitely my favorite thing about the color scheme
of this toy is the really nice light red "flame" deco on the rear of the
wings-- it really helps give the toy some individuality considering this
is the mold's third use. However, this does come at a slight price-- all
that paint in vehicle mode makes his legs virtually bare of the stuff in
robot mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe 2.0 Skyfall, though like on
     <a href="darkwind.html">
      Darkwind
     </a>
     ,
all the colored lights have been made red.

     Universe 2.0 Skyfall
is a great repaint to an obscure character, with the light red and gold
going exceedingly well with the black. He also has some particularly nice
deco jobs on the wings. It's still a mediocre and overly-simplistic mold
for the price, but if you only get one version of this mold, make it this
one, even at the slightly-inflated price.

       No one trusts Skyfall, and rightly so.
If he proposes a toast to your health, it's probably because he poisoned
your drink. He is a master spy, with connections throughout both the Autobot
and Decepticon armies. Rumors about him run rampant, and he does nothing
to confirm or deny any of them. He enjoys the uncertainty and even fear
with which other Decepticons regard him. He is one of the few Decepticons
to enjoy solitary face-to-face meetings with Megatron, and yet he has been
spotted openly walking through Autobot bases as well.
