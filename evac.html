    Evac's alternate mode
is a rescue helicopter. Compared to other helicopter Transformers, this
mode is very good; most other Transformers with this kind of alt mode have
obvious robot extras and the like, but Evac has relatively few. The only
hint that he's a robot comes from the rear section of the main body of
the helicopter, where there are a few slight gaps in the general shape
of the vehicle as well as some obvious panels and his robot hips. Really,
if what becomes the knees in robot mode had extended up farther to hide
the hips in this mode, even this area of the helicopter would have looked
pretty seamless for a non-Alternator Transformer. One other slight downside
to this mode is that the landing gear are kinda weak; for a Voyager-class
Transformer, I would expect the landing gear to have actual wheels on them
instead of just details to look like wheels, and the latter is the case
on Evac-- the landing gear is also a bit small proportionally as well.
Otherwise, this mode is one of the best helicopter modes I've seen, with
great proportions and a adequately realistic feel to it. The cockpit windows
are transparent with seats and a control panel molded inside, there's little
spinning rear propellers in the tail, and a good amount of mold detailing
(although not an above-average amount). There's also pretty good paint
detailing to help break up all the safety orangish-yellow, and the white,
blue, and greyish blue go reasonably well with the orangish-yellow. The
color scheme is certainly a realistic one for a rescue helicopter, though
when compared to other Transformers' schemes, it's a tad loud-- a good
repaint would probably bump this mold up on the buy-o-meter a little more.
Evac has not one, not two, but THREE gimmicks! First, if you press in the
tab on the side of the helicopter's "roof", the main propeller spins, and
pretty well, too. Second, you can pull out the winch on the side of the
helicopter, then press the red button on it to retract the hook. (It retracts
a bit TOO fast, though-- it's practically instantaneous, I'd like to actually
see the thing retract in a more realistic fashion. The winch rope could
also stand to be a little longer, too.) And finally, if you insert Evac's
Cyber Key into the slot behind his main propeller, two fireable missile
launchers flip out from the sides! They do get in the way of the propeller-spinning
tab, but this is a small downside. Also noticeable on Evac is his lack
of electronics, something that has occured rarely in a $20 Transformer
up to this point since the turn of the century, though I don't particularly
miss them.

    Evac's robot mode is
also one of the best of any Transformer with his alt mode, and differentiates
itself a bit more from previous helicopter by having the tail split into
halves behind the shoulders rather than just fold down the backside. The
tail halves can either extend out to the sides of the shoulders or fold
down so that they stick out from the sides of the body-- both configurations
look alright, but I like the extended-behind-the-shoulders configuration
better, as I think it complements the mode a bit more. Evac has great proportions
in his robot mode-- the only thing that's a little off is that his upper
legs are too short, but given the transformation, lengthening them would
have made them more obvious in helicopter mode, so I can see why this wasn't
done. Evac's also got outstanding articulation-- he can move into pretty
much any configuration your heart could desire (as long as you're being
reasonable for a $20 toy, of course-- he obviously can't pick his nose).
The winch and propeller on the back of his arms can get in the way of arm
articulation slightly if you've got his tail halves extended behind his
shoulders, however. His chest and shoulders also have some GREAT paint
and mold detailing, and I love his the design on his chest almost looks
like a winch hook. I'm not fond of his face, however-- the "helmet" around
it is molded fine, and the eyes have a great light piping effect, but the
nose is too long and the determined look is a bit too exaggerated, with
the bags under his eyes too pronounced. Given that his lower face sticks
out a bit from his eyes, it almost looks like he's got a monkey face, in
fact. Another slight downside to this mode is that the Cyber Key-activated
missile launchers only point upwards in this mode in their default configuration--
you can partially unhook them from the backside and point them forwards
over his head, but this looks rather odd.

    Evac is a great helicopter
Transformer design-- one of the best (if not THE best) there's ever been.
He's got some small drawbacks, like his odd robot face and a few small
gaps in his vehicle mode, but otherwise he's amazing. Highly recommended--
though, unless you're a completist, you may want to get an Evac repaint
coming on down the line instead of this initial release, since I imagine
his color scheme will be better on a repaint.

      Evac loves flying on Earth almost as
much as he loved soaring over the epic skylines of Cybertron. he's been
in hiding on Earth since guardianship of the Planet Key was passed on to
him millions of years ago. he feels keen affection for the people of Earth,
whose history he has observed from its very beginnings. it frustrates him
that the Transformers must keep their presence on Earth a secret, because
he recognizes the potential value of the humans as allies. Courageous,
determined and gentle, Evac avoids fighting when he can, but if forced
into combat, he can be a very tough opponent. He is dedicated to the protection
of other life in all its forms.
