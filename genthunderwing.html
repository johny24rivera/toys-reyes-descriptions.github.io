    Thunderwing's alt mode
is a futuristic-looking jet, or "space jet", as I like to call it. It should
be noted that this isn't meant to be a DIRECT "upgrade" of the G1 Thunderwing
character, as that was a Pretender-- rather, this is more of the IDW-verse
Thunderwing, who is a monster in his own right with a somewhat similar
alt mode and a bio that matches this toy's quite closely. It's honestly
a bit disappointing to see such a huge character given a mere deluxe-sized
toy, but ignoring that, this alt mode suits him quite well, with the long
nosecone and forward-bending wings. The proportions of the "core" jet are
fairly good-- with the exception of the aforementioned wings, which are
honestly laughably small. He has three retractable landing gear in this
mode, and the front of the nosecone can detach to form a little "drone"
hovercraft. It's only a little thing with no articulation of its own, but
it's still a nice little touch. The most obvious downside to this mode
is, well, the robot mode tucked up underneath the plane-- it MOSTLY says
under the wings, but it's still fairly obvious and ruins a bit the whole
aerodynamic look Thunderwing's got going on his jet parts. The robot arms
are the biggest offenders, being the most obvious, but at least they have
little guns facing forward from them to at least partially mitigate this
downside. The robot feet also stick out the back end a bit obviously. The
color scheme is honestly a bit blah-- the tannish off-white color isn't
particularly appetizing-- but the dark blue and purple help to contrast
against it a bit. The translucent orange plastic also looks nice against
the base color, but there really needed to be another paint app or two
on the main body of the jet to help bring out all that nice mold detailing
on him. Thunderwing has two spring-loaded missile launchers that fit under
each of his wings in this mode for weaponry.

    Thunderwing's robot
mode is made to resemble his pretender shell "monster-like" appearance
a bit, and it's definitely the mode that took priority in his design. First,
let's get the downsides out of the way-- his transformation is very straightforward
and a little boring, being little more than a "stand me up on my rear end
and pull out my limbs" kinda transformation. He's short, even for a deluxe,
which runs at complete odds with his character traditionally. His nosecone
also just sits on his upper back, though at least it doesn't get in the
way of movement. That said, particularly when compared with his jet mode,
most of what I have to say about this mode is pretty positive. The pseudo-organic
look of his robot mode is carried out marvelously, with golden "tubes"
highlighted on his dull green arms and uper legs, a detailed (both in terms
of mold detailing and paint detailing) chest that's fairly accurate to
his G1 toy, and a fierce-looking face with "light piping" for the eyes
that works very well even in fairly low light. The increased amount of
colors-- and considerably increased number of paint apps-- help to make
this mode look a lot more eye-catching than his vehicle mode, though I'm
still not a fan of that ugly tannish off-white. I also love the unique
way his wings fan out next to his shoulders-- it enhances his silouhette
considerably, almost like a cape. He can hold his two detachable missile
launchers in his hands in this mode, though they look a little big compared
to him. As for articulation, Thunderwing can move at hte neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows, wrists, hips (at two points), knees, and a little
bit at the ankles. The flaps on his "skirt" can move from side-to-side,
as well. His wings can get in the way of shoulder movement, and his back-heavyness
can be a tad bit of a posing problem, but generally his articulation gets
the job done, even if it's not extraordinary (too much of it is concentrated
around the shoulders and hips, and not enough at the elbows &amp; knees).

    If you're a fan of the
character, Generations Thunderwing is a fairly easy recommendation. If
you don't have any particular connection to him, however, there's oodles
of Generations toys that, frankly, are better-engineered with more interesting
transformations. His robot mode detailing is quite unique, but his overly
simplistic transformation, small size, ugly tannish-white plastic, and
mediocre jet mode tend to cancel that out and then some.

      Thunderwing is so single-minded and
powerful that even Megatron hesitates to get in his way. He is loyal to
the Decepticon commander, but once he is given an order, nothing stops
him until the mission is complete. All too often, that mission is the annihilation
of a world that has defied the will of Megatron-- a task at which Thunderwing
excels.
