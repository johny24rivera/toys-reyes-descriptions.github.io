    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Barricade
w/ Frenzy toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Barricade w/ Frenzy toy

here really isn't so much a repaint as a bit of remolding done to the base
toy, without any other changes done. Since Frenzy is dead by RotF, he's
been removed from the mold and in his place are Barricade's "headlight-claws"
seen briefly in the first movie. By themselves, they look pretty cool,
and are articulated at two points on each arm, in addition the movement
to have them fold away inside Barricade's gril for vehicle mode (so unlike
the pictures above, no, they don't always have to be out). They can also
be completely removed from the grill and positioned behind his head, as
seen in the above robot pic. However, when looked at as a whole, they do
certainly look odd and aren't something I'd have sticking out of the toy
on a regular basis. Particularly in robot mode-- a pair of vestigial chest
arms just doesn't suit Barricade. As far as coloring and decos, he's exactly
the same as the original deluxe Movie Barricade.

     Interrogator Barricade
has an interesting new accessory to replace Frenzy, but ultimate an extra
pair of freaky arms just isn't quite as cool as coming with a little buddy,
even if said little buddy didn't have much movement. I'd recommend the
original version of this mold over this one.

       Repaired and retrofitted after the battle
of Mission City, Barricade elected to remain on Earth while Starscream
returned to Cybertron. He has devoted his time on Earth to gathering intelligence
for the inevitable rise of the Decepticons. He stalks and captures important
humans, then scans, interrogates and disposes of his captives using the
highly sensitive probes built into his vehicle mode.
