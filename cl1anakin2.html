    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Class I Episode II Starfighter
Obi-Wan Kenobi. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Class
I Episode II Starfighter Obi-Wan Kenobi

     What's this? A mold that
HASN'T been redecoed into Anakin Skywalker?! Well, we'll rectify that!
All joking aside, Anakin gets another of his arsenal of mechs from the
line in the form of a smaller version of the Episode II Starfighter, to
mirror his
     <a href="anakin2cw.html">
      larger version
     </a>
     . Anakin's main color
on most of his SWTFs has been yellow, and if you've been reading my reviews
for a while you know that-- with very few exceptions-- I don't like yellow
as a main color. So Anakin's vehicle mode doesn't look as good to me as
the other iterations of this mold, though the deco patterns are fairly
neat and-- in fairness-- they contrast better with the grayish blue than
on the flatter brownish gray seen on his larger "Class II" version of this
design. The metallic dark brown cockpit window also looks pretty good even
by itself, but contrasts well with the surrounding colors, too. In mech
mode, the colors of his clothing are duplicated fairly well with dark brown
and a fair amount of dark blue. It's not the most interesting color scheme
in the world, but it certainly fits Anakin well and the colors definitely
don't clash. He's also got a good amount of paint detailing, as you'd expect
from a Star Wars Transformer-- even little details like his R2 unit are
detailed, along with three different colors of paint on his face.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Anakin Skywalker except, as you'd expect,
the mech mode head. Given the size, more mechanized look, and more "square"
hair detailing, this one might as well be a duplicate of his
     <a href="cl1anakin.html">
      Episode
III Starfighter
     </a>
     version of this class size-- which would certainly
be fitting, given the whole thing about them being the same character.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Class I Episode
II Starfighter version of Anakin isn't bad per se, but it's difficult to
see why this toy was needed, exactly. Anakin's got a bazillion other SWTFs
(including two others of this general design), he's got two other toys
just in the Class I size (THREE others if you count
     <a href="cl1vader.html">
      Vader
     </a>
     ),
and the other uses of this mold have better color schemes. Thus, I'd only
recommend him for Anakin or SWTF completists.
