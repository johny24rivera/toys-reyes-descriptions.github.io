    Vehicle mode is described
on the package as "assault vehicle". Exactly what Strika's vehicle mode
is, I'm not certain. Some kind of Cybertronian vehicle, no doubt, that
looks like a cross between an ATV and a tank with a head. This mode looks
very, very nice, and with the exception of some color variations, is very
show-accurate. The detailing on te toy is also pretty good, especially
for a vehicle, which doesn't need that much detailing anyway. What I especially
love about this mode is the dark purple wash on the front part, making
Strika look a bit "worn down" in this mode. Her one, long, cycloptic eye
in this mode also looks very menacing and emotionless. Strika's gimmick,
usable in both this mode and the robot mode, is pretty cool, although also
pretty pointless. Basically, when you press down on the spark crystal located
near the end of Strika's back, her "laser cannons" reciprocate (meaning
that one "fires" while the other "reloads", providing continuous fire).
For this toy, this basically means that the two laser cannons move back
and forth very quickly. A bit too quickly, in fact- by just pressing down
on the spark crystal once all the way, it makes the cannons move back and
forth three times! Once per push would have been slower and a bit more
realistic. Another complaint about this gimmick is that it doesn't actually
fire the missiles- the missiles require you to push them out of their slots
to "fire". Still, this gimmick is quite addicting, just pushing down on
the button repeatedly and watching the cannons move back and forth almost
faster than the eye can track them. One downside to this mode, however,
is that from a directly head-on view, you can see some of Strika's robot
extras under her vehicle head, and her robot legs are fairly visible behind
her wheels. Still, this isn't too big of a deal, and this vehicle mode
still remains one of my favorites from the Beast Machines line.

    The robot mode, although
still decent, I felt could have been done quite a bit better, and made
a bit more show-accurate. It's still fun to play with, what with the reciprocating
cannons and Strika's "butch" stature, but she looks rather odd from a side
view, and even slightly odd from a head-on view. First, and most obvious,
is the fact that Strika's arms are very oddly positioned in this mode-
they're a full inch behind the robot chest, not to mention that the lower
arms are actually positioned on a hinge BEHIND the upper arms, making for
an extremely odd pose no matter how you position them. The gold shoulder
carvings are a nice, touch however. Strika's hands are also little more
than engravings on the inside of some of her vehicle mode armor, but this
is forgivable, since her arms were always "hidden" behind wrist pads on
the show anyway. The inside of Strika's vehicle head is also very visible
behind Strika's robot head, and I felt they could have hidden this extra
away a bit better. Strika's robot head is still very detailed, and colored
rather nicely despite this. Compared to the show, Strika's chest plate
is alkso extremely small proportionally, and although the wheels sticking
out of the sides of the chest plate help bulk it up a little, it still
doesn't look that awful good. Strika's legs are also very small proportionally,
and, because she is so top-heavy, you actually have to lean her forward
a bit to keep her balanced by herself in this mode. This isn't that big
of a deal, though, since she looks slightly better from an angle like that,
and it sort of simulates how she "skates" to move when in robot mode on
the show. Although her feet are little more than wheels with stilts for
heels, this isn't that big of a problem; they actually make it look like
she's wearing large platform shoes or something, which adds a bit of personality
to this mode. Another interesting note about Strika is that she is the
only Beast Machines toy to have no translucent plastic on her whatsoever
(not including the spark crystal, of course, but those are on every toy
since the

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    A GREAT vehicle mode,
although the robot mode may look a bit odd to some. Still, I'd recommend
this toy to anyone wanting a great heavy-hitter Vehicon. This toy looks
like it can kick butt and take names.

      Strika's presence on the battlefield
often turns the tide in favor of the Vehicons. Holds a personal vendetta
against all Maximals, especially Blackarachnia. In combat, will lure enemy
into rough terrain to give herself the advantage. Equipped with reciprocating
laser cannon that shreds anything caught in its field of fire. Can wreak
havoc with one sustained blast from her cannon. Alloy-plated armor deflects
many types of Maximal ammo. Capable of high speed bursts on any terrain
and has amazing endurance in close combat.
