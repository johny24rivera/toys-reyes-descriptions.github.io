Vector Prime's vehicle mode is very accurate to the larger version in more
ways than one. The mold and paint detailing is incredibly good-- heck,
it's nearly as good as it is on the larger toy! All the little gold, brown,
and teal paint apps near the back end of this mode look especially remarkable
as well. What's particularly noteworthy is that the main color of light
pearly gray is the same color from the Japanese version of Vector Prime,
not the pure white of the American Vector Prime. Not that I'm complaining,
of course-- this color clearly looks better-- but it is rather odd. Vector
Prime does have a few more robot extras in this mode than his larger counterpart
does, however. For one, the robot face is just sticking up right there
in the middle of the vehicle mode-- nothing is done at all to hide it.
It's rather distracting. Another, lesser, extra is that the robot legs
on the underside of the vehicle mode are bulkier in proportion to the rest
of this mode when compared to the larger version, and the end result of
this is that Vector Prime looks less like something that could conceivably
fly. (The robot fists are also rather obvious, but that was the case on
the larger version as well, so...)

     In robot mode, Vector
Prime looks great, with no proportional problems at all. The only major
difference between this version and the larger toy (beyond the absence
of his sword and the Minicon Safeguard, of course) is that the wings don't
fold together to form his "cloak". It doesn't look as good the way the
wings are situated on this toy, but it still doesn't look bad by any means.
His articulation is rather limited-- he can move at the shoulders, hips,
ankles, and the knees-- but it's still a little above-average for a LoC
figure. The hips can move forward slightly, but not much, due to the plastic
pieces in front of them and the way the ball joints are situated. I also
have to say, his head really needs some paint apps around the face. Perhaps
taking off one of the chest paint apps and using that on the face instead
would've looked a little better.

     LoC Vector Prime isn't
as great as the larger version, but he's also just 1/4th of the cost. With
the exception of a few more obvious extras in vehicle mode, this toy is
pretty darn good for its cheap price, and is the second best LoC mold next

     , in my opinion. Mildly recommended.
