    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Landmine. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Landmine

     Landquake has a VERY
nice color scheme that practically screams that he's built for arctic exploration.
All of the colors fit together perfectly- the icy blue and white remind
one of snow-covered plains, and the brown and bluish black could resemble
bits of dirt or dirty snow sticking up out of jagged edges of rock or something.
And the cold, metallic silver really helps out this scheme, as well. And
if that's still not enough to convince you that Landquake is meant to be
an arctic Autobot, he's got tampos- in silver- on some of his brown parts
that clearly show a bunch of pine trees and a picture of a mountain. So,
yeah. Alaska, here comes Landquake. In fact-- and this is one of the VERY
few times I say this-- I literally wouldn't change a thing about Landquake's
color scheme. Not one-- it's absolutely perfect for this toy. Even the
orange, which may look a little objectionable at first, makes perfect sense
when you consider that it's part of his "arctic RESCUE" schtick. Plus,
you need to have some way that Autobots can spot him from far away in the
arctic.

     No mold changes have
been made to Landquake. So, unfortunately, his missile still fires far
too easily, just like Landmine's.

     Landquake is a good
mold already, and his perfect arctic-themed color scheme is icing on the
cake. Recommended over Landmine, and I already highly recommended Landmine
as it was. Definitely don't pass this prize up.

       This incredibly powerful Autobot possesses
a physical design similar to his brother, Landmine. Unlike Landmine, Landquake
does not enjoy one-to-one scrapes with Decepticon enemies. He believes
that fighting is a waste of time. Instead, he prefers to help the Omnicons
mine energon. During many excavations, Landquake has used his powerful
fists to crack open energon-rich rock deposits in extreme climates like
the Arctic. When there is a call to battle, however, he will not hesitate
to use his brute strength to thwart an enemy attack. Many Decepticon have
learned that angering this gentle giant can prove to be a ground-shaking
error.
