    Fixit's alternate mode
is-- just like with the
    <a href="rid21stepfixit.html">
     1-step changer
    </a>
    --
a driller kinda thing that is pretty obviously his robot mode with the
front section rotated down and forward. The back wheels are a bit bigger
proportionally on this version which looks pretty good, and the arms from
robot mode make for pretty convincing drills in the front given that...
well... they are drills. The rest of the mode is very obviously just Hasbro
trying to get an alt mode out of a character designed with none in mind
(especially since Fixit has no alt mode on the show). I mean, the "body"
of this mode is just the body of the robot mode, with the face folded up
into the helmet so it's not as obvious. (That said, having the "cap" of
Fixit's robot mode just sticking out there above the wheels looks pretty
weird, too.) Fixit's color scheme of gray and orange is intact on this
toy, with the gray a bit darker than usual (but still not quite as dark
that I'd call it "medium"). It's a pretty okay scheme, with nothing being
out-of-place, but nothing really sticking out, either. I do rather like
the metallic bronze paint on the stripes behind the drills and on the upper
waist, as it serves as a nice complementary color to the orange. There's
also a bit of black on Fixit's "spike" in the middle of his helmet. I wish
there was some paint on the taillights on this mode, as those little bumps
are one of the VERY few mold details on this toy are that are unpainted.
(It's fairly sparse even for a RID2015 toy, which makes it look pretty
cartoony and "cute"-- which admittedly fits Fixit). Plus, the back end
is rather hollow and neglected, so it could've used a bit of paint.

    Fixit's transformation
is blatantly obvious, as mentioned before-- just rotate the body up and
then flip down his face. He's actually one of the tallest Legion figures,
but if you put him next to, say, a 3-step changer, he's pretty show-accurate
in terms of scale. This mode very accurately replicates Fixit's show model,
with no extras from vehicle mode whatsoever. (One could argue the drill-hands
are extras instead of there being actual hands that could flip out, but
Fixit HAS used drill hands in the show.) He's got a rather slim, trim main
body with the chest just as wide as the waist, with wheels for feet that
are fitted with rims that make them look very "wheelchair-like". He's got
a fairly cute, accurate headsculpt with a silver face, circular blue eyes,
and a happy white angular mouth. There's also some silver paint on the
lower body that's only visible in this mode, to help break up all the orange
near the bottom. For articulation, Fixit can move at the neck (at two points),
shoulders, elbows, rotation at the waist, and slight up-down movement at
the waist, too. I mean, considering that the shoulders and elbows are ball
joints, this is about as much articulation as you could reasonably expect
on him-- which is all the more impressive since it's a Legion figure.

    If you want a Fixit
figure, this is my recommendation for pretty much everyone unless you're
getting one for a really young kid who you don't think can handle even
simple transformations on small figures. His alt mode's extraordinarily
weak, but unfortunately that's just part of his design. The robot mode
is amazingly show-accurate, in scale with the larger RID figures, and has
excellent articulation and proportions. Even if you're not into Legion-scale
figures, if you like the RID show this is a recommended purchase to complete
the core cast.
