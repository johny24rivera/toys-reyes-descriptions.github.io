    Instead of a tyrannosaurus,
the new version of Grimlock is now a Ford Mustang GT. I have mixed feelings
about this. For one, there are a LOT of more deserving G1 characters to
get an Alternators upgrade than Grimlock-- I mean, being a Dinobot is so
etched into Grimlock's character, it's rather disconcerting to see him
as anything else. But at least the style of the Ford Mustang GT fits Grimlock's
brutish personality more than most other Alternators so far-- it's not
nearly as sleek as many of the other Alternators cars, and it's a bit on
the large side for an Alternator car. Plus, the overall color scheme is
reasonably close to G1 Grimlock's. As for the car mode itself, it's about
what you'd expect from an Alternator-- the vehicle mode is practically
flawless. It's got great detailing, a top-notch paint scheme, rubber tires,
adjustable interior seats, clear headlights, and the like. If you look
at the front of the car from a strictly head-on view, the robot fists tend
to stick out of the bottom a little, but that's the only robot "extras"
whatsoever in this mode, and that's a pretty minor extra. Another small
quibble I have is that the seats are light red-- I REALLY doubt they're
that color on the real Ford Mustang model, and it looks a tad gaudy. Oh,
and the front hood seems to be slightly elevated above its surrounding
plastic parts-- all the stuff bunched up inside the front of the car won't
let that hood piece come down to be at QUITE the same level as its surrounding
pieces. But these are all rather small complaints-- they by no means ruin
the mode at all.

    Grimlock's robot mode
is very, VERY close to perfect. Really, the only complaint I can possibly
see anyone having about him is that a panel from the bottom of the car
mode that hangs off his butt. But this looks kind of a like a medieval
armor "skirt", so I really don't mind it much at all- though it does restrict
upper leg movement a tad. The rest of the so-called "extras"-- the front
car windshield hanging off the upper back, the door panels on the shoulders,
and the wheels on the lower arms-- either stay well out of the way or complement
the look of the mode. (I also think it's creative how the car seats form
Grimlock's feet.) Grimlock's overall proportions are great, while still
hearkening back to his G1 form, with the panels reaching out from the sides
of his body and the large lower legs. (And on the inside of those legs,
there's also a lot of cool mechanical detailing.) His articulation is also
outstanding-- he can move at pretty much any point you can reasonably expect
on a $20 Transformer, with the sole exception of side-to-side knee articulation.
His
head looks great, and is nearly spot-on when compared with his G1 version--
except more detailed, of course. And Grimlock comes with not just one,
but TWO weapons-- a two-barreled gun made from his car engine and his trademark
Energon sword. So he's ready for battle!

    Alternator Grimlock
is the best Alternator yet, and that's saying a LOT. An absolutely fantastic
figure, with only a few very minor problems in car mode. Highly recommended,
so long as you aren't rough with your toys-- Grimlock does have a lot of
skinny plastic parts involved in his transformation, so I could see them
breaking if you throw him around a lot.

        Alternator Grimlock's
alternate mode is a Ford Mustang GT, and it looks REALLY nice. The painting
is realistic and looks great. He has openeing doors, hood, and a trunk,
which is very nice. But the thing that stands out about this guy is that
he has NO robot extras. At all. Even the bottom is completely flat and
detailed. The hands stick out a tiny bit from the bottom, but they look
more like part of the car radiator than extras. The sword is stored under
there, and supposedly it's the drive train; looks just about as much of
a drive train as 'ol Beastbot looks like a twinkie-- if you have heard
that line before, you read a lot of reviews here. ;] Of all the Transformers
I have, this guy has just about the best vehicle mode. In addition to all
that, he has the rubber wheels and steering function. In respect to Beastbot's
review, there is the option to have a red interior, but it is a much darker
shade, not the bright red as seen on Grimlock here. Not that I mind it.

        Quick note about his
transformation, transforming him from car to robot is fairly easy. However,
turning him back can be a pain the first couple times.

        Now for a vehicle mode
that good, you would expect the robot mode to be bad, yes? Well, wrong.
Grimlock's robot mode is stunning. The feet, made of the seats to the car,
are neat and look awesome. He has pretty good articulation, I just wish
he has an upper leg swivle, but that's a minor quibble. He's not without
his flaws, however. To start, his joints easily pop off in his arms, which
can be an annoyance. Next, the lack of a leg swivel as mentioned above.
Other than that, he's a very nice figure and I highly recommend him.
