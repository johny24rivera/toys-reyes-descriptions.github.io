    Beast mode is a mosquito,
as you can tell by the name. His wings look big and fierce, as does his
face. His insect legs are exceptionally long, but he cant stand up on
them. They are all individually articulated, but, besides the wings, that's
basically it for poseability. However, it is very evident that he is a
robot in beast mode because his hands are clearly visible, no matter which
angle you look at him, and his abdomen (which splits into his legs in robot
mode) cannot stick together easily.

    His battle mode (not
pictured above) is weird, but fierce. It is his robot mode with the upper
part flipped out to reveal red eyes and his wings fold out to become GIANT
pincers, almost a foot long by themelves!

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    His robot mode looks
more like a nightmarish monster than a robot. There are barely any robot
parts. His insect legs on his arms stick out and interfere a lot. His beast
head also sticks out a bit more than it should. Other than that, this modes
okay, with a missle that can shoot out of his mouth, and "wing flapping
action" that can be activated by a purple lever on his back in either mode.
In battle mode, this same action can be used to open and close his giant
pincers.

    This is not the best
mega beast, but the easiest to transform.

      There are few that can match Transquito's
uncanny ability to track and discover hidden Maximal outposts. Converting
to combat mode, he can hold off several Maximals at once with huge, poison-tipped
pincers. Any unfortunate robot surviving a strike from these pinchers is
immediately afflicted with an irritating rash and sent into a delirious
rage. His powerful wings hurtle him to blazing speeds and create an annoying
high-pitched screech known to drive Maximals out of their minds. His manner
is highly obnoxious and dangerous, a point well illustrated by a frequent
and destructive habit of firing his missile launcher incessantly when upset.
Transquito is hated by all who know him.
