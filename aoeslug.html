    Of all the Age of Extinction
Dinobots, Slug's visage in beast mode looks the spikiest and most demonic--
and that's REALLY saying something. Not satisfied with a mere three horns,
Slug also has two horns underneath his jaw, and it looks like nearly all
of this mode is made up of shards of metal spikes or bones; some nifty
spine detailing is clearly visible down the back, and his tail isn't so
much a regular tail as a ribcage with a larger center mass. (It should
be noted that all of these gray horns and spikey bits are made of soft,
rubbery plastic, but they aren't put under a lot of stress, so they don't
have a tendency to warp.) He's got sharper teeth than any triceratops I've
ever seen, and his eyes look absolutely insane, like slits within slits,
just like most of the rest of the AoE Dinobots. Add to all this the red
angular paint apps along his front head crests and the silver paint detailing
on his face, and Slug is one wild-looking dinosaur of doom. His color scheme
isn't movie-accurate, but in this case I don't mind, as it helps to differentiate
him a bit more visually from his Dinobot brethren-- he's mostly dark brown-gray,
light gray, and a rather nifty shade of bluish purple. The brownish gray
looks pretty nice, but the light gray is unfortunately of that really blah
shade I wish Hasbro would do away with already, though it does have just
a titch of purple mixed in with it to help it go with the other colors
a bit more. At least the light gray and the red and silver paint apps help
to give some good contrast against the dark blue-purple, though. The metallic
shade of black used for the dino claws is a good shade, too. This mode
is largely solid-looking, and fairly proportional as far as fictional monster-dinosaurs
go. There are a few minor robot extras visible, though, the most obvious
being the robot toes sticking up from the top of the rear legs. The upper
robot legs also don't peg into their slots on the underside of the brownish-gray
rear spine piece, which makes this mode feel less solid than it should.
For articulation, Slug can move at the jaw, shoulders, front knees, at
one section at the base of the tail, and at the hips (barely) and toes
(again, with limited movement). Because of his transformation and all the
spikey bits, this makes him more limited in this respect than I'd like,
but I honestly don't see how they could've done much better at this scale
with this aesthetic. For weapons, Slug, has two lances, that oddly plug
into holes on the sides of his stomach in this mode-- with the blades pointing
waaay out. It looks very odd, and given that these lances are made of soft
plastic, they tend to fall out of their holes rather easily. I tend to
just leave them out-- which is saying something, considering how much I
prefer my weapons storable in alt mode.

    Slug's transformation
is only slightly more complex than a standard beast "stand me up and flip
my head" transformation, with the head halves instead becoming shoulders
while the robot arms are formed from the stomach and the dino front legs
tab into the sides of his main body. Overall, there are certain aspects
of this mode I find appealing, but by and large the body has some real
problems going on. The main body is too skinny proportionally, and the
dino legs pegged into the side don't bulk him out, they just look like...
well, like really obvious dino legs hanging off his midsection. His tail
section also just hangs below his butt in a rather unappealing manner.
That said, his appendages look good-- his arms are nice and bulky, and
I love how macabre the triceratops skull-halves on his shoulders look,
with parts of the crests folded down to make the shoulders look a bit more
substantial and three-dimensional. The legs also look nice proportionally,
with the dino claws folding into the knees pretty well and the AoE Dinobot-standard
"pointy knight boots" for feet. The headsculpt is also well-done and very
un-movie-like, being a rather straightforward round knight helmet with
a single visor that, unfortunately, doesn't feature any light piping. The
mold detailing in general in this mode falls more to the "rocky, armory"
kind-- impressive, given how much is shared between two modes, to give
both modes such a different look. The paint apps sadly aren't nearly as
numerous in this mode, with the head and stomach being the only parts that
get paint apps exclusive to this mode-- the legs in particular could've
used another paint app or two. For articulation, in this mode Slug can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points; three if you count the dino-half
shoulder armor bits), elbows (at two points), slightly inward at the wrists,
and rotation at the waist (restricted some because of the dino legs on
the back), hips, knees (at three points), and slightly at the toes. This
isn't quite as good as it seems, because of all the spikey bits and kibble
on his main body, but he's still fairly poseable.

    The deluxe version of
AoE Slug looks incredibly awesome in beast mode, with tons of incredible
detailing that alternates between bones, spikes, and rocky armor bits.
His beast head in particular looks amazing. In robot mode he's considerably
weaker of a toy, with the dino kibble becoming a problem around the midsection,
along with some minor proportional problems. All in all, he's about middle-of-the-pack
as far as the "mainline" Dinobot toys go-- he's got some excellent redeeming
features, but some annoying downsides, as well.

the version of this toy released in that 2-pack is exactly the same as
this (mass release) version; it is also packed in with an unaltered
