      The color scheme for
Clench is awesome- I would take absolutely nothing away from it. The purplish
black looks a bit "impure" at first, but it does go together with the maroon
slightly better than just plain black would have. The bronzish gold, silver,
and pale white highlights are also nice contrasts. I especialyl like said
pale white highlight, since there's not too much of it and it exemplifies
the Minicon insignia on Clench's chest. Clench could have used maybe a
bit of detailing on his legs in robot mode, but that's really about all
I can think of.

      Clench is quite a bit
improvement over Leader-1's color scheme, and is honestly as about as good
as I think this toy can get. Pret-ty nice.

        Galvatron's new color
scheme has two sides to it. From one side, I do like the more liberal use
of black than he had the last time. And it fits just perfectly with the
maroon and bronzish gold. I especially love the face- a eviller-looking
Decepticon leader there isn't.
       </font>
       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        However, the overusage of that lavenderish
pink in robot mode really makes Galvatron's color scheme a bit too pink
and "girly". It's not as apparent in the tank mode, although the tank mode
has its own problems; although the "mud" wash on the treads and the charred
black spots on the hull are really great touches, they take away larger
paint apps from the top of the tank, thus making it look just mostly plain
white. I would rather have had the silver-painted panels from Armada Megatron's
tank mode, thanks. The Decepticon symbols on Galvatron in robot mode are
also very pink in their coloration... what happened to the purple Decepticon
symbols?
       </font>
       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Overall, I'd have to
say that Megatron wins out over Galvatron in this case, although the mold
itself is pretty darn good. Galvatron just has a bit too "girly" of a look
to his coloration in robot mode and has too much white on him in vehicle
mode for him to triumph over his predecessor color-wise.

          Galvatron is a powered up version of
Megatron making him the epitome of egotistical might and tyranny. He is
a self-centered maniacal bully who constantly abuses those around him in
order to advance his wishes and dreams. While he despises incompetence
and petty bickering he demands complete and utter loyalty. Even the most
devote of his warriors are pawns to be used, maneuvered, gambled with,
and if need be, sacrificed. He is a power broker in a universe of infinite
possibilities. Galvatron has a vision where he travels the universe, collecting
instruments of power, gobbling up resources, dominating species, declaring
wars, ravaging planets, and drinks from the goblet of strife.
