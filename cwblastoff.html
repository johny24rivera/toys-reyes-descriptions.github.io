not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Firefly. For

     Blast Off is...a jet?
Well, honestly, it makes a lot more sense than a space shuttle, given the
whole "military" theme of the Combaticons. That said, it is ANOTHER redeco
of a Combiner Wars jet mold, most of which transform pretty similarly.
That said, applying Blast Off's traditional colors to the Firefly mold
looks pretty good. Of course the main color is a drab olive brown, with
a dark purple more visible in robot mode as its major "foil" color. However,
both of these colors are pretty dark, and thus don't contrast all that
well with each other. To compound this issue, another of Blast Off's colors
is black-- but on the plus side, it's a rather nice-looking metallic shade
of the color (except on the rubbery nosecone piece, of course). This black
paint is used on the normal gun, as well as Blast Off's fists, face, the
lower sides of his chest, his feet, and on the outer stripes of his wings
and tailfin. Luckily, there's some light purple, silver, and yellow paint
apps to the rescue to give Blast Off some contrast! The yellow definitely
stands out the most, being used on the right side of the chest and on the
knees, though I'm glad it isn't used any more than that-- it would clash
if it was anything more than an accent color. The silver is used entirely
on the borders of the stripes on Blast Off's wings, which really help bring
out the purple stripes there and are much appreciated. The pastel purple
is used for the cockpit and Blast Off's optics, and is a quite nice color,
both contrasting against the olive brown and complementing the dark purple--
I wish it was used a tad more on the figure, honestly. Blast Off's hand/foot/gun
accessory is unfortunately that blah light shade of milky gray, but that
IS the color of all of these accessories for the Combaticons, so it fits.

     headsculpt, but no mold changes unique to this release of the mold have
been made-- a bummer for me. To me, this is a bigger issue than Blast Off
being a jet, as at least that makes sense thematically-- but Blast Off
is supposed to have a faceplate! I don't like the regular mouth, even if
it's painted black.

     The mass release Combiner
Wars Blast Off figure is a jet instead of a space shuttle, and although
it does make sense, another CW jet redeco may not excite many fans, and
I can't say I blame them, especially when he doesn't even have a new headsculpt.
That said, his colors ARE applied quite well on the toy and he has a good
amount of variation, though I wish he had a few more light color paint
apps. If you only want to spend retail on Blast Off, this here's your Combaticon--
otherwise, you may want to get the shuttle version developed by TakaraTOMY
and eventually released by Hasbro, albeit in a slightly more expensive/exclusive
manner.

       Most bots unlucky enough to find themselves
in the sights of Decepticon Blast Off don't have any idea what's about
to hit them. His preferred method is to attack from orbit, destroying targets
with a pinpoint laser strike from high above a planet's surface.

        During his first tour with the Combaticons,
Blast Off altered his Cybertronian spaceship mode into an Earth-styled
space shuttle. He took immense pleasure and satisfaction in delivering
pinpoint laser shots from orbit, mastering the art of sending "pain from
above". His capture and imprisonment on Cybertron crippled the Combaticons,
leaving them unable to combine and form Bruticus. When Blast Off was finally
reuinted with his comrades, Onslaught required him to change his vehicle
mode once again. This time, he became a fighter jet in order to stay closer
to the team. His X-ray cannons are fearsome weapons, and his ionic blaster
works in close combat. With fellow Combaticons forms Bruticus.

         Blast Off can find the cloud in any
silver lining. His unhappiness with the loneliness of stellar orbit has
been replaced with anger at having to change alternate modes from shuttle
to jet. If it makes Blast Off a more focused soldier, Onslaught (his commanding
officer) is all for it. Forms either an arm or leg of Bruticus, the combined
form of the Combaticons.
