    Beast mode is a scorpion.
There is almost no clue that he is a robot in this mode, except for the
robot legs which protrude a bit from his main body. His mouth looks a little
odd, as it becomes his feet in robot mode. He has rather exaggerated claws
and a stinger, but, all in all, nice, with decent detailing. He has a "stinging"
action, where if you lift a lever on his lower tail, the upper tail will
dart forward. Pretty nice.

    In robot mode, he is
pretty good. He has two faces; a gas mask face and his face on the TV
show. His stinger sort of sticks out in the back, which is the only real
extra in this mode, since the claws actually complement this mode a little.
A slightly bigger problem is that the scorpion legs which hold the body
together tend to slip once and a while, and the body falls apart. His feet
look a bit odd, since his heels are bigger than the front of the feet,
but this is no big loss. The only reason I didnt give this guy a higher
rating is because of his right claw, which launches a cyber bee. After
you fire this thing 15 or more times, the spring starts to wear out(or
at least it did in mine), and the bee cant stay on the claw anymore, so
you have a half-claw with a peg sticking out of it. The other claw fires
two missles when you open it, and while this is cool, it gets a little
annoying after a while, since you can easily set it off.

    An okay mega transformer,
except for the cyberbee.

      The searing summer heat of the Mojave
desert turns it into a dry, barren wasteland. A place where only the strong
survive. A place the vicious Scorponok calls home. With hidden robotic
technology incorporated into its scorpion body structure, this desert attack
specialist surprises enemies 3 different ways; by launching its robotic
bee; firing a 2 shot missile blast; and by using its terrifying tail for
poisonous Cyber Strikes!
