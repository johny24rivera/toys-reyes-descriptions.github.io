    Arcee's vehicle mode--
as it's been in several of her incarnations, now-- is a motorcycle. It's
a dark blue motorcycle, as opposed to her usual white/pinkish red color
scheme. It's a pretty nifty shade of blue if you really look at it, but
it is a bit TOO dark compared to the show model, and could've used a bit
more lightening up, particularly since the other main color for Arcee is
black. The silver paint apps on parts of her body, tailpipes, and blades
help to break up all of this darkness, but the silver isn't QUITE light
enough to do it effectively, in my book. Only the transparent blue used
for Arcee's windshield is what I would consider a bonafide "light" color,
here. When it comes to First Edtion toys, Arcee is probably the one who
has the most obvious robot kibble in her motorcycle mode. The overall proportions
are quite good (though the "bump" in front of the rider's seat is a bit
larger than it should be, which makes the windshield look a tad too low),
but the robot arms are somewhat obvious folded up partially behind the
blue "shoulder" pieces on each side of the cycle, and her feet are also
pretty obvious poking out behind those pieces. Also, if you remove the
blade pieces, her lower legs are also pretty obvious, though that's a more
minor quibble. This results in a motorcycle that is slightly too wide if
looked at from the front/back (more obvious if you note that she doesn't
need her kickstand piece to stand up straight here). The mold detailing
makes her fit right in with the Prime aesthetic, with some pieces being
impressively detailed (such as the interior of her wheels), while most
of the armor pieces have a style that alternatively goes between rounded
and pointed edges (more of the latter with Arcee in particular). It makes
for a rather sleek, dynamic-looking motorcycle mode from a side or diagonal
view.

    Unlike most other First
Edition figures, Arcee's transformation isn't all that complex, and in
fact is only slightly more complicated than her "vanilla" mainline "Robots
in Disguise" release. Her arms and legs unfold in a rather straightforward
manner, she twists around at the waist, you pull out her head, and move
her front tire and most of her windshield behind her back. (However, these
pieces don't really fold back all the way, making them the only real obvious
pieces of vehicle mode kibble here.) There are some creative little bits,
though, such as how her rear wheel splits in half and folds into a gap
in her lower legs to give her legs a rather unique look, and I also love
how two parts of the windshield split off and flip forward to form her
chest. In robot mode, Arcee is bit tall for a deluxe when compared to other
Prime toys, which is a bit disconcerting given that she's easily the smallest
member of Team Prime-- but hey, I'm not going to complain about getting
MORE plastic for a deluxe price point, and she looks just fine by herself.
Her main body and head are very well-detailed, with a great amount of color
variety (especially around her stomach), and the metallic pale pink on
her head crests and parts of her lower legs helps add another contrast
color to the mix, though I would've preferred if it had been a little lighter
for better contrast and show accuracy. Her pointed stiletto heels look
nice and help with her characterization and look, and I'm also a fan of
how her upper legs have small see-through holes in them, while her upper
arms are nearly pipe-cleaner-thin-- this helps make it look like she's
really stretching out her mass in robot mode, which is certainly true in
the show (they take it almost past the point of believability in her mass-shifting,
there). However, other than that particular characterization, I'm not a
huge fan of the large shoulder plates that hang off her upper arms-- they
aren't accurate to the show at all, and don't have any paint detailing
on them, meaning that Arcee's arms definitely lack some color variety.
However, she can attach her blade weapons to the underside of her lower
arms just like in the show, and they make for great melee weapons. Although
Arcee's head is molded so that her eyes can use light piping, it actually
doesn't work that well for her, unfortunately. For articulation, Arcee
can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), back-and-forth at the wrists, and she can also move at
the waist, hips (at two points), and knees. Thus, her lower legs aren't
the most articulate, but pretty much everything else is, and since she's
well-balanced this means she can pull off a pretty good number of poses.

    Whether I would recommend
First Edition Arcee over the mainlne "Robots in Disguise" release depends
on what you think matters more for her. If two blade-weapons matter, a
more show-accurate chest, and show-accuracy and looks in robot mode matter,
than this is the version of Arcee that you want. However, if a more accurate
vehicle mode and show-accurate color scheme is what you want, the "Robots
in Disguise" release is for you. Overall I like this version SLIGHTLY more,
but not enough to just recommend that it be the Prime Arcee purchase for
everyone.
