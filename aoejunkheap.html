    Junkheap's alternate
mode is a Waste Management trash/recycling truck, though in the movie THREE
Junkheaps were formed from ONE truck-- but especially for the Power Battler
line, that's not really doable, and the guy wasn't in the movie nearly
long enough to justify a large toy of him that would be able to pull it
off, so this option's fine for me. The proportions in this mode are generally
solid, as you'd expect from a toy with a licensed alt mode. The thing is,
there are some VERY obvious robot extras in this mode-- the worse offenders
being the robot arms, which not-so-convincingly make up the roof of the
front part of this mode. Although not QUITE as obvious, but still pretty
high on the blatant-o-meter, is the robot head, which is upside down facing
forward right behind said arms. From a side view or a mostly top-down view
it's not obvious, but from a view anywhere near the front? It's just right
THERE, man. Couldn't it have faced the other direction and rotated at the
neck during transformation? Ugh. On a much lesser note, a bit of the robot
upper legs stick out of the bottom, but it's only a little. Same with a
couple of robot details on the back end-- just barely worth mentioning,
given the aim of the Power Battler line. The mold detailing in this mode
is pretty good, with not just the necessary details like the windows and
wheels molded in (though the middle wheel on each side is fake; only the
front and back wheels actually roll), but little details like ladders on
the sides, hydraulics, and the like molded into the sides. The color scheme
is exactly what you'd expect for a Waste Management truck-- white and dark
green, with a little yellow for good measure. The white and dark green
contrast against each other quite well, and obviously the yellow contrasts
and complements the green well on the back end. There's some black where
necessary, like on the wheels, though some of the robot parts (more obvious
in robot mode) are that really blah light milky gray that I really wish
would just disappear from TFs entirely in favor of a darker, more metallic
version of the plastic color. The paint detailing is mostly limited to
the cab and the yellow on the back end. The front windows and grill are
silver, along with the front bumper being painted black, but sadly the
side windows and headlights are unpainted, as are details on the side like
the ladders. There is a nice "Waste Management" logo on each side, though.
Junkheap can activate his Power Battler gimmick in either mode-- push down
on the white button on the top of this mode, and the back end will open
up and lunge out a considerable amount, in just the sort of "claw crush"
action advertised on the packaging. It's a pretty simple, but cool gimmick,
like a sudden lunge at a soon-to-be meal. I love it.

    The transformation to
Junkheap's robot mode is pretty simple, with the front and bottom sections
swinging down to become the legs, while the arms and head flip over and
clip onto the back end, making the back end now the chest (and making the
action feature a literal "get in my belly" feature. Again, I love it).
Other than the obvious cab halves on the feet, the vehicle parts meld into
Junkheap's overall silhouette very well in this mode. He's a little "deeper"
than you'd expect if you look at him from a side angle, but not obnoxiously
so. His arms are just a LITTLE skinny, but otherwise his proportions are
pretty good in this mode. His mold detailing is insanely intricate in this
mode, and very accurate to his movie model, with little mechanical hinges,
pistons, and greebles all over the place on the arms, legs, chest, and
head. Unfortunately not many of his details are actually painted-- he has
the silver paint on his chest, and the silver bits on his mouth vent and
forehead, along with some yellow on his eyes (?-- it's difficult to tell
from the intricacy of the detailing), but his arms are void of paint, as
are his legs on any part that's readily visible in this mode, beyond some
green on the sides used for vehicle mode. That said, his colors are broken
up more in this mode, so it's not as obvious as in his vehicular form.
Articulation is always one of the weaknesses of the Power Battler line,
and although Junkheap isn't up to the standard of a "mainline Generations"
figure, he can move at the shoulders (at two points), knees, and SLIGHT
movement at the ankle tilts. It's not a lot, but it's better than most
in the line, and given the transformation he couldn't really move at the
hips anyways.

    Junkheap definitely
has a few downsides-- like his very obvious head and arms in vehicle mode,
a few too few paint apps, and odd boxy cab-halves for feet in robot mode,
but other than that he's a pretty solid entry in the Power Battler line
with a really fun gimmick, which is fortunate given that there's no other
toy of him. As long as you can overlook the obvious arms and relatively
little articulation, I'd get this toy even if you normally skip this subline
for the "mainline" movie toys-- it's just a fun toy of a little-known Decepticon
in a movie that had very few unique designs for them.
