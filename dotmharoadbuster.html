    Unlike the other "large"
Human Alliance toys, Roadbuster's vehicle mode isn't a (more or less) scaled-down
replica of a real car, but rather that car (a Chevrolet Impala) in its
"Stealth Force" mode-- i.e., a car with "robot bits" and weapons poking
out of it. Given the source material, Roadbuster looks pretty good in this
mode, all things considered-- yeah, he looks a bit more meched-up and cluttered
than your typical Human Alliance vehicle, but that's sort of the point.
There really aren't any "proper" robot mode bits showing through this mode
at all, and the proportions look pretty decent. He's got TONS of mold detailing,
with little pipes, fenders, tubes, and the like abound. Some detailing
near the back even looks a jet engine (and if you press the trigger on
top of this engine, it'll fire its yellow "exhaust" missile, via a traditional
spring launcher)! He's also got missile racks near the sides, guns that
essentially form out of his headlights, a sawblade that can rotate out
from the right side, and a front rotary machine gun-- this guy's definitely
not going to have a problem shooting up the bad guys in car mode, that's
for sure. His missile racks and headlight-guns can also move up and down
at two points each for some additional positioning. The paint detailing
is also largely good, with most of the essential exposed parts painted
silver or metallic gunmetal gray, while a few parts on the sides are painted
white. He still has his "88" symbols, as well as NASCAR, National Guard,
Sprint, Chevrolet, and Amp Energy Drink logos on him. The bottom sides--
and far too many parts of his robot mode, while I'm at it-- are that blah
shade of light milky gray that's far too prevalent on TFs. Even if the
money wasn't there for all the gray to be painted silver, a metallic shade
of plastic would've looked much better. That said, the dark green-- along
with the black and white-- are prevalent enough in this mode where it's
not that big of a deal. His human partner, Sergeant Recon, looks like your
average race car driver figure in a racing helmet, so nothing special about
him (he can move in all the places all the other Human Alliance figurines
can). Before I go onto the robot mode, though, I want to mention one thing
about this car mode that bugs me. As much as I like the idea of having
a "Stealth Force" mode for a Human Alliance figure like this, I wish that,
at this size/price range, it had a "normal" car mode as well. I don't think
that's too much to ask for for $30 U.S.-- but that's honestly not my biggest
problem with it. The thing is, with just a "Stealth Force" mode and no
"normal" car mode, things already look fragmented up in vehicle mode. Thus,
when you're transforming the toy back from robot to vehicle, it can be
a bit more difficult than you'd think to figure out exactly how everything
fits together, given the lack of the usual "steamlined visual cues" that
normal vehicle pieces have. It took me several times before I got the transformation
of this guy down pat, even though by following the instructions nothing's
particularly complex by itself.

    Roadbuster's robot mode
is about as similarly cluttered as his "Stealth Force" mode, but then again
that's fairly movie-accurate, so I can't fault them too much in that department.
That said, oddly enough Roadbuster's chest is his weakest point in this
mode-- there's portions of his chest-hood that are a bit too skinny, and
many of the parts near his waist in particular are rather fiddly and don't
lock/tab into place anywhere. His upper arms are pretty nice-looking, with
the way the chairs curl around the shoulders to give them more mass and
de-emphasize the tires there, while the missile launchers-- as is accurate
to the movie-- hang off the sides. His lower arms are considerably weaker,
though, merely being made up of the door panels folded over each other,
and thus look a bit overly stiff and strict in their movement because of
it. His hands also can't open and close like most Human Alliance figures'
of this size can, though his sawblade and missile launcher can be mounted
on the back of his arms. As for the legs, they're this mode's strongest
aspect-- they're a bit overly panel-y, but nice and solid and well-proportioned,
with not much wiggling around. Most of his vehicle mode extras are involved
someone in some important aspect of his robot mode, so there isn't much
outright kibble, but the little that there is-- namely his vehicle mode
and front rotary gun-- fold behind his back nicely and stay out of the
way of movement while attempting to make his chest &amp; waist look a bit
more massive. Roadbuster's excellent mold detailing carries over into this
mode, with his head and inner chest bits being particularly intricate--
and, if you lift up his "cap", you can swap in-and-out his visor! (I think
his face looks a bit odd without said visor lowered, however.) Unfortunately,
aside from his face the paint detailing is all concentrated on his vehicle
mode-- none of his other robot-specific parts have any paint on them. Luckily,
Roadbuster's silouhette and colors are largely broken up enough in this
mode where this isn't a big issue. Another of Roadbuster's weaknesses in
this mode is that, for a Human Alliance figure, he doesn't really have
much for his human partner to DO in this mode-- both of his seats are folded
up against his shoulders so there's nowhere for Sergeant Recon to sit.
Sgt. Recon can technically "man" Roadbuster's rotary gun behind his upper
back by grabbing onto its handelbars, but there's only the tiniest of fold-out
panels for him to stand/sit back there, so he sort of hangs off awkwardly--
and that's IF you can get him to grip those handlebars well in the first
place, which is rather difficult as they're a tad too big. As for articulation,
Roadbuster can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at
two points), inwards at the wrists, and at the hips (at two points), knees
(at two points), and slightly at the ankles. His lower arm articulation,
as noted earlier, is a bit more restricted than average because of how
he's constructed, but otherwise he has average articulation for the size
class.

    Human Alliance Roadbuster
is a pretty neat toy, and definitely the most involved, feature-boasting
toy of the character. That said, he can be rather fidgety even for a Human
Alliance toy, and a few minor parts of his robot mode (namely his chest,
lower arms, and ability to incorporate human figurines) are a bit weak.
Definitely recommended if you want a big, more complex version of the character;
otherwise, the

best bet.

      Roadbuster is out racing in vehicle
mode whenever he gets a break from pulverizing Decepticons. He's found
that allowing humans to ride with him-- especially professional racecar
drivers-- sharpens his tactical skills and knowledge of Earth's road network.
Even Transformers sometimes like to sit back, relax and go along for the
ride!
