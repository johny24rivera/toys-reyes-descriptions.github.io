    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Downshift. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Downshift

     Oh, joy. Another lazy
Universe exclusive "repaint". And, considering that it's at KB Toys, it's
overpriced for a deluxe as well ($13 U.S. as opposed to $10). Universe
Downshift is hardly different from Energon Downshift, and the few changes
that were made make the toy uglier. First, the tan and bronze on the Energon
version has been replaced with yellow. Granted, the yellow isn't too noxious
of a color, but the tan was still definitely preferable. The nifty slanted
metallic green pattern on the vehicle mode has also been replaced with
straight black lines with a ridiculously large Autobot symbol on the front
hood. Talk about a bullseye for Decepticon aircraft... The black stripes
themselves aren't bad perse, but again, the green stripes on the Energon
version did just look better. Other than that, except for a few very minor
detail changes, everything else is the same as on Energon Downshift.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe Downshift.

     Universe Downshift is
a waste of a perfectly good exclusive, really. He's inferior to Energon
Downshift in every place that he's different, and he isn't that different
to begin with. Recommended only if you REALLY want a version of this mold
and absolutely can NOT find the Energon version for a reasonable price
(which is unlikely).

       One of the few Autobots left behind
on Cybertron after the evacuation, Downshift has been assigned by Optimus
Prime to guard the entrances to the shafts leading to the Energon core
of the planet in the city of Iacon. A loner by nature, and a veteran of
many tough, secret missions throughout the galaxy, Downshift is perfectly
at home on the desolate and damaged planet.
