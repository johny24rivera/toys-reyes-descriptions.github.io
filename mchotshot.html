    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
sportscar. This mode is alright, if a bit kiddy- but then again, it IS
a Happy Meal toy. Besides the slightly more surrealistic proportions, though,
this mode is pretty accurate when compared to the "official"

    . It's even got the same fold-out bumpers (although they don't fold
out all the way). The wheels themselves aren't actual wheels, but just
molded into the plastic. The actual wheels are really small ones on the
bottom side of the car, and when you pull it back and let it go, it zooms
across a flat surface. Rather neat. His Autobot symbol is on the left side
of the top hood of the car in this mode.

    Robot mode is beyond
horrible. There are still some details that identify it as Hot Shot, such
as the race car helmet-shaped head and the car windows on the sides of
the arms, but he's horribly bloated. His head and feet look positively
infintesimal when compared to his body. Not to mention it looks like he's
walking on miniature stilts, the way his legs are positioned. Hot Shot
also has two Powerlinx ports on the tops of his shoulders, but they're
too close together to really attach a seperate Minicon to each of them.
Meh. He also has two Minicon ports on the bottoms of his feet, but he looks
REALLY weird hangin' off a larger Transformer like that. He also can only
move his arms back-and-forth and his legs side-to-side, severely limiting
his posability. His Autobot symbol in this mode is on the center of his
chest.

    Dang, Hot Shot, quit
eatin' all them Ho-Hos. It isn't making you look pretty. Pretty much this
toy's only redeeming feature is the "pull back-'n-go" gimmick in his so-so
car mode. Even the normal Armada version looks like gold compared to...
this.
