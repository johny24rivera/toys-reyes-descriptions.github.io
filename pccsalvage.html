     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Bomb-Burst here is primarily
red, with his transparent plastic being a bit of a darker color than the
opaque plastic used for his back and upper legs. Both of the shades of
red complement each other fairly nicely, and the silver on the legs also
helps give a tad more color variety on the toy to boot. Unfortunately,
Bomb-Burst here has noticeably fewer paint apps than his predecessor Chainclaw,
so even with those bits of silver (and a tad of yellow painted on his missiles
and head), there's still a lot of unbroken red on him. On the plus side,
all the red does allow him to contrast nicely with Salvage.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      No mold changes have

     </font>
     <br/>
     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Bomb-Burst is essentially
Chainclaw in red with less paint apps. I already liked Chainclaw's blue
more than Bomb-Burst's red (mostly because of personal color preference),
but the noticeably fewer paint apps definitely make me recommend Chainclaw
over this version.

        Despite his bio making
him the same character as the
        <a href="salvage.html">
         TF1 toy of the same

        </a>
        , PCC Salvage bears no real resemblance to his previous iteration
beyond them both being four-wheeled Autobots. That aside, Salvage's new
color scheme is a really attractive shade of blue that looks great even
by itself, really. Luckily, though, that's not the case-- in addition to
the black and the (admittedly rather blah) milky brownish gray he has as
his rather neutral secondary colors, he also has a fair amount of dark
greenish blue visible in his robot mode, which complements his other shade
of blue quite nicely. What's also nice about this color scheme is that
the light blue combiner ports complement the scheme rather than sticking
out like sore thumbs )like they do on most Power Core Combiners). There's
also some really nice paint accents on the figure, like the white "splash"
paint apps on the sides of his vehicle mode, or the gold truck windows
and face, or the silver engine and pipes. His headlights are both colored
to make them stand out quite a bit too and add even more color variety,
which is appreciated. The yellow eyes against the face on his combined
mode head also looks rather striking.

        No overt mold changes
have been made to PCC Salvage, but the common structural weakness in this
mold's upper legs (detailed in my review of Mudslinger) appears to have
been fixed on this redeco.
       </font>
       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Salvage is a fantastic
redeco, with great color choices and a great VARIETY of colors, as well.
Having the mold flaw from Mudslinger fixed is the cherry on top, and I'd
definitely recommend this redeco over its original version. However, that
said, it's still a decidedly medicore mold at best, and as such this is
easily the 2011 Power Core Combiner release I'd recommend the least.

          Salvage has gone through a lot since
the AllSpark first brought him to life. A few rounds of upgrades brought
his vehicle mode into the modern era, and the Power Core process powered
him up to unheard of levels. He'd still rather be back at the junkyard,
but if the Decepticons want a fight, he's ready to give them one.
