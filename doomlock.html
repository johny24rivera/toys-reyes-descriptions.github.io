    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cruellock. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Cruellock

     Doom-Lock, the "upgraded"
form of Cruellock, has more of a red-and-blue color scheme, whereas his
predecessor had a "scaly lizard" type of color scheme. And overall, I think
it really works well with this mold. Most of his raptor parts are dark
red, and he has many orange and red paint apps adorning his body, as well
as orange Energon parts, so that gives him a really cool fiery look. (The
only thing that concerns me slightly here are his energon weapons- I mean,
it does look mighty cool, but I thought Decepticons were supposed to have
green energon?) However, many of his robot mode parts have a rather icey-looking
color scheme, being either off-white, light blue, or blue gray. Now, normally,
I wouldn't really like this contradiction in elemental themes-- looking
both icy and fiery at the same time-- but for some reason I can't quite
explain, it works extraordinarily well on Doom-Lock. A lot better, I think,
than the Japanese version of this recolor- "Dinobot Magma Type"- where
the colors are too primary for my taste, even though they make the toy
look REALLY fiery. Here, the color scheme is much more original-- almost
royal-looking, actually-- and he has enough red and orange paint apps covering
his body where all the light colors don't seem out of place on a Decepticon.

     Doom-Lock is an awesome
repaint, with a great color scheme that surpasses that of his predecessor,
Cruellock. It's certainly very original, and I'd recommend it to any fan
of the Decepticons.
