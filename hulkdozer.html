    Hulk gets upgraded from
his weak old
    <a href="hulktf.html">
     tank form
    </a>
    into a... bulldozer? No,
wait, that can't be right.... huh. Well, I'll just pretend THIS is initial
form, then. Anyways, out of all the Marvel TFs up to this point, this is
definitely the most modified and "kiddy" when compared to its real-life
counterpart. Honestly, this bulldozer mode is practically a square. The
proportions are all out of wack, and frankly looks a little ridiculous.
Still, at least the proportions keep Hulk from having obvious Mech mode
parts visible in this mode-- if you look at him from the back end, you
can see the bottom of his feet components, but that's it. The mold detailing
is quite good as well, with panels, rivets, and pipes molded into any large
area of plastic on Hulk, for the most part. He also has some cracks all
throughout his form, which is indicative of who this mold was originally
intended to be (with a different head mold)-- the Thing. The treads in
particular have some great mold detailing, thogh unfortunately there's
no paint detailing there to bring it out. Even though the paint detailing
on this figure isn't as bad as it is on, say,
    <a href="thortf.html">
     Thor
    </a>
    ,
Hulk could still really use some more paint apps here, like on his pipes
or vents. There's a really nice "worn metal" paint app across the bottom
of his front, and his front and side windows and headlights are painted
in this mode, but that's it. (And his back window isn't painted, to boot.)
As far as his color scheme goes, it's classic Hulk-- mostly green, but
with a bit of silver mixed in to "robot-ize" things up a bit, and with
some purple as well since he's got purple "pants" traditionally (I never
really understood why that was...).

    Alright, take Hulk's
Mech mode. Crop off too much of it at the sides. It looks pretty good like
this! The front grill of the bulldozer makes a nice chest, and generally
his proportions are quite well-done, with the bulldozer roof and windows
collapsing behind his back and out of the way. His legs also look pretty
good, and the upper parts of each are colored to look like he's still wearing
his purple shorts. His headsculpt looks great-- in fact, it looks EXACTLY
like his tank version's head. I think they actually just directly took
that sculpt and applied it to this mold, in fact. Unfortunately, when you
include Hulk's arms in the equation... quite frankly, he looks ridiculous.
His shoulders don't come forward and up enough in relation to where they
connect to the body, so they don't look good in that respect. His shoulder
pieces hang out too much from the body, his arms are too long with no elbows,
he has big shovel pieces hanging off the back of his fists, and the fists
are kinda ridiculous-looking as well, given how big they are. Really, pretty
much EVERYTHING about Hulk's arms are absolutely awful. As for articulation,
Hulk can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), wrists, waist, hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles. So again, good articulation...
except for in the arms.

    Hulk's bulldozer is
the definitely the stinker of the Marvel Crossovers line up to this point
(5/10). Although he's got some good mold detailing and a few good design
elements, for the most part he's got ridiculous, overly chunky proportions
in vehicle mode and utterly stupid-looking, unarticulated, overly long
arms in robot mode. Only recommended for completists and the most diehard
Hulk fans.

      Upon reflection, Mr. Fantastic thought
that giving Hulk a tank wasnt the best idea in the world. He built this
new battle suit for the super strong hero. Its technology directs the green
powerhouses strength directly into the Earth, letting him cause earthquakes
that shatter the ground under his enemies feet.
