    Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode actually isn't all that "superdeformed" compared to most other Tiny
Turbo Changer vehicle modes. The wheels are certainly a bit bigger than
they should be, and the smokestacks and front bumper are definitely more
apparent; the nose of the truck is also a fair bit shorter. The main body
of the truck is actually pretty spot-on, as are the windows. The back end
is a little short, but given the robot mode that's probably more a side
effect of that more than anything else. And yes, it is pretty darned obvious
the back end of this mode becomes the robot mode legs; it's split in two
on the back half, with the heels of the feet just right there. Of course,
this is MUCH more acceptable on a Tiny Turbo Changer than a larger, higher-budget
toy, and the mold detailing on Optimus in this mode is pretty good; beyond
the main, necessary details, the wheels are quite well-detailed, as are
the little headlights on the visor above the windows and especially the
top of the truck bed, which has a hitch and detailing on it that looks
like steel flooring. The main plastic color is a somewhat dark blue, same
as most of the other TLK toys. Of course, being a Tiny Turbo Changer he
doesn't have much paint, though his wheels are painted a glossy black (no,
they don't roll; they're not separate pieces, just like on every other
TTT). He also has some basic flame paint patterns on his roof, though unfortunately
none on his front hood or sides.

    To transform Optimus
to robot mode, just fold the front hood/grill piece up and over, and then
split the remaining portions of the truck body into his arms, fold 'em
around, and stand him up. The end result is definitely much more "superdeformed"
here, with a very large head proportionaly and a smaller body and appendages.
The extras are a bit more egregious in this mode, with that entire front
hood/grill piece just hanging out behind his lower head and body, not really
trying to be anything else. His arms and legs are also merely detailed
inside the "shells" of his truck body halves and the rear section of his
truck mode, respectively; you can see the bits of truck on the outside
of the arms and obvious wheels on the legs. The "core" of the robot mode
is detailed extremely well mold-wise, with the main armor pieces intricately
detailed on the body in particular. There's also quite a few movie-accurate
details on the legs and arms, though they're not QUITE as impressive. The
head is pretty spot-on accurate as well, minus the larger eyes. Of course,
the paint detailing doesn't nearly match the intricacy, here; no flames
at all in this mode, and only his chest/waist armor is painted silver on
his body, while his faceplate is also silver and his eyes are a fairly
light blue (though honestly I would've preferred an even lighter shade
for better contrast). Otherwise he's all dark blue in this mode. For articulation,
Optimus can move at the shoulders in this mode-- both of them on ball joints.

    Optimus is a slightly
above-average Tiny Turbo Changer mold. That front hood/grill piece on his
robot mode is a bit of an eyesore, and in truck mode the truck bed is a
bit weak, too. Still, he gets in all the necessary details in both modes
without too much chicanery for the size and price. Of course, I wish he
had more paint apps and articulation like with all TTTs, but the budget
for these little cheapies is what it is. Mildly recommended if you like
these little guys.
