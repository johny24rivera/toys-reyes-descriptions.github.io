    Like the other Titans
Return Legends toys that are compatible with

    /Soundwave,
Rewind's alternate mode is a smartphone. ...or is it? There's foil stickers
placed on the center of this mode that have a picture of a cassette tape
on them, but ALSO the little symbols along the sides you'd associate with
a smartphone screen, like wifi bars, a battery life symbol, etc. I guess
Hasbro lets you decide on this one. Anyways, the proportions for this mode
are fairly solid, being mostly a square that's slightly narrowed at the
top for transformation purposes (it's not a big deal, though). There are
some hollow parts or bits seen on the sides that are minor eyesores, like
gaps in the plastic on the sides, the fairly obvious gun slotted in the
left side, and gray ball joints easily seen on the bottom side. Again,
though, these are minor complaints at best-- it's still a pretty solid
mode proportionally. The foil stickers used for the "screen" on the smartphone
are a bit on the fragile side, so they can crease or crinkle a bit after
repeated transformations, but given how Rewind transforms it's not as bad
as on the other Legends smartphone molds. The color scheme of black and
light milky gray (yes, it's that really blah shade of the color) isn't
particularly eye-catching, but the aforementioned foil sticker details
and a bit of red and silver around the bottom and top of this mode help
give at least a little bit of color to the mold.

    To make Rewind more
exciting than just transforming into a block of plastic, like the other
Titans Return smartphone 'bots he has a vehicle mode as well and it's...
actually good, especially for a tertiary mode. Basically you take out the
gun from the sides, and then the side pieces of the smartphone fold up
and upon themselves to form the turret of the tank, with the removed gun
then slotted into the front of these turret parts. (Make sure to take out
the gun BEFORE you start to fold up those side bits-- you can bend that
gun piece easily if you don't take it out first. Also, the two pieces on
the sides fold up VERY tightly, to the point where a few people have seen
theirs crack after repeated transformations, so be a bit careful with that
step.) There's certainly some issues with the tank mode proportionally--
the back segment behind the turret is a bit too thick, the turret can't
move at all, and there's an extra bit of "tank body" in front of the tread
details on the side-- but by and large it's a pretty decent mode. The colors
are broken up a bit more cleanly, with the turret having nearly all of
the gray and the tank body having nearly all the black plastic. Rewind's
smartphone mode obviously didn't have a lot of mold detailing on it, but
in tank mode there's a few more details that come out-- the silver-painted
treads are a nice extra detail that also helps break up the black some
more, and there's a couple of "armor plating" details on the turret as
well. On the top of the turret, there's four total little pegs so you can
stand two little Titan Masters on top of Rewind in this mode, to help tie
him into the rest of the line.

    Rewind's robot mode
is essentially a folding of the lower arms and unfolding of everything
else from smartphone mode, and the end result is pretty darned strong.
It has a few nods to the IDW version-- such as the little camera embedded
in his head, which is rather IDW-esque in its molding-- but otherwise he's
a bit more G1-esque in how "buff" he is, particularly in the arms. Honestly,
his lower arms are my only real complaint about this mode-- having the
lower arms merely molded into overly large plastic blocks is rather weak,
especially given that one of them has hollow detailing. The wide shoulders
look pretty good, though, and it complements the somewhat skinny waist
and legs pretty well, like Rewind's been bodybuilding or something. I also
appreciate the little nub of the treads that fold up to become toes and
keep Rewind stable in this mode. There's some pretty nice paint apps on
the chest and shoulders that hearken back to the G1 toy's detailing, and
help break up the black as well. The red faceplate and light blue eyes
also look nice against the gray head (though if it were up to me, the head
would've been painted silver). Rewind's gun can be held in either of his
fist holes, or mounted in a hole on the side of his right lower arm. As
for articulation, Rewind's got that too-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at two points), hips, knees, and VERY slightly
at the ankles. He's fairly well-balanced as well, so he can get into some
cool poses.

    Rewind is easily the
best of the Titans Return smartphone molds-- all three of his modes are
at least decent. His smartphone mode is solid, his tank mode is a tad awkward
in some respects but still pretty good for a teritary mode, and his robot
mode in particular is very well-done (lower arms aside). He's got a few
nice paint apps here and there, but his main weakness is his color scheme--
light milky gray and black is just a boring scheme, G1-accurate or no.
They should've added either a few more paint apps or given him another
base color to lighten him up a bit. Still, a very easy recommendation for
fans of the character-- I just we had gotten Eject from the mold too, as
he has better colors...
