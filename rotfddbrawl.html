    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie deluxe
class Brawl toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie deluxe class Brawl toy

     It's hardly surprising
that after some of his other various molds getting the desert redeco treatment,
the deluxe version of Brawl gets the same paint job as well. My comments
are mostly the same here as with the other times this paint job has been
used on Brawl-- it's certainly very fitting for the vehicle mode, at least
as much as the green color scheme if not more so. To keep a straight tan
scheme from getting too boring, there's several dark muddy brown camo paint
apps strewn throughout the figure, and it really helps with his contrast
(though I wish a few more of those camo paint apps had been added to the
back of his tank mode). The black and gunmetal gray also serves as some
nice dark contrast colors to an otherwise light color scheme, and I particularly
like the gunmetal gray plastic-- it's not painted, but it almost looks
like it is. It pulls off a nice effect that I wish a lot of other Transformers
would use as a "neutral" color instead of that incredibly bland light milky
gray so many of them do. The usage of transparent orange for the optics
and the missile is also a nice touch and goes very well with the tan color
scheme.

     No obvious mold changes
have been made to Deep Desert Brawl-- but the oh-so-vital tabs that connect
his arms to his torso in robot mode have been FIXED! They now plug in very
snugly, and don't flop around-- hallelujah! This, my friends, is why Deep
Desert Brawl's rating is so much higher than the original Movie deluxe
Brawl. That one fix just makes all the difference.

     RotF Deep Desert Brawl
is a nice themed repaint, with all the colors going together quite nicely,
and some nice dark brown camo paint apps keeping things from getting too
boring. I also really wish they'd use the gunmetal gray plastic on this
toy on more Transformers, it looks quite good. Just judging from the color
scheme, I wouldn't say it was either better or worse than the original
Movie deluxe Brawl, just different-- but the fixing of those darned shoulder
tabs in robot mode really makes the toy function much better and drastically
improves its playability. Definitely a recommended buy, even if you bought
the original Movie deluxe Brawl, as now this nice design can be enjoyed
without that big caveat in robot mode.

       Hidden deep in the driest desert on
Earth, Decepticon Brawl waited for a new Decepticon leader to emerge. Though
the Autobots searched for him, they never even came close to finding him.
It enraged him that he was forced to hide in defeat. Now that Megatron
has returned, he is ready to do battle again, and determined this time
to destroy as many Autobots as he can.
