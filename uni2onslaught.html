    Onslaught's vehicle mode
has a shape that's pretty much the opposite of his original G1 form. His
original toy had an exceedingly long military truck transport alt mode,
while this one has a very squat, compact S.W.A.T. police vehicle alt mode.
It still works, though, as it's definitely an armored vehicle that has
some firepower-- namely, the twin guns on the top, under the rather odd-looking
SWAT shield attachment (which can be taken off easily, I might add). By
pressing the light red button near the back of said twin guns (which are
on a rotating turret), one of two sound effects will be emitted. One is
a very satisfying machine gun fire in which the bases of the gun light
up red. The other is obviously broken-- it's supposed to be a cycling siren
sound, with red light-up sirens to go with it, but they must have forgotten
to program the loop into it or something, because you hear only one short
wail for a fraction of a second and then it stops. Later releases of this
figure have fixed this problem, though. There's also two flip-down claws
at the front of this vehicle mode, to help cut through those dastardly
mobs. The color scheme is very close to Onslaught's G1 colors, with blue
and green being the primary colors with a bit of gray and black. The addition
of transparent orange makes for a nice accent color, and though I would've
hoped for a bit more green, overall Onslaught has a pretty rockin' color
scheme. The mold detailing is also very good, with details like rivets
and vents molded almost everywhere on his body that it makes sense. (One
little fan-nod on this toy is the "MONZO" words on the side, which is the
Internet name of the Transfan who notified Hasbro that the Onslaught name
copyright was available again. The numbers under the name are his birthdate.)
Having translucent headlights and taillights is a nice touch, too. There's
no robot extras in this mode, with the exception of Onslaught's arm-gun
which pokes out a bit from the bottom, but that's a minor nitpick.

    Onslaught's transformation
is fairly simple for an Ultra-- just complicated enough to escape the "easy"
transformation difficulty rating-- but it creates a very imposing robot
mode. (And no, before you ask, he doesn't combine with other Transformers
like G1 Onslaught-- apparently Hasbro wanted to make the toy better by
not having him combine with anyone else.) The head sculpt is incredibly
well-done, with a transparent visor and lots of paint detailing (though
no light piping, sadly). His twin guns stick up behind his back, but other
than those two things and his color scheme is general design is completely
different from G1 Onslaught's. It's more bulky and "meched up". The proportions
are pretty good when you take that into consideration, though the size
difference between the upper and lower legs is pretty significant. (You
can also see into the lower legs a bit-- probably my biggest beef with
the robot mode.) Other minor beefs I have with this mode are that there's
a bit of a gap between his head and his chest, his guns can't be brought
forward over his shoulders to fire, and there's a noticeably hollow spot
behind his fists. These are all fairly minor things, though, and don't
take away much from the impressive look this mode has. I love how the vehicle
mode claws form the shoulders, and how it looks like the front of the vehicle
mode compresses down and fits into Onslaught's chest, even though it actually
doesn't. Onslaught also has a gun that flips forward from his right lower
arm if you press a button, and though it's a cool gimmick, I honestly would've
preferred something handheld better. His other hand has a flip-out tab
that you can mount Onslaught's SWAT shield on (not pictured so you can
see more of his robot mode-- it's pretty big proportionally), which is
a nice touch. Onslaught articulation is quite good-- he can move at the
head, shoulders (at three points), elbows, wrists, hips (at two points),
and knees (at two points). His large feet and lack of back-heavy kibble
provide him with some pretty good stability as well, so you can get a good
number of cool poses out of him.

    Universe Onslaught is
the best original Ultra-class mold they've come up for the line as of this
writing (1/09), and though he has a few niggling problems like hollow-looking
legs in robot mode, they don't add up to much. A highly recommended purchase.

      If Onslaught enters into direct combat,
it's only because something has gone wrong with his battle plan. He prefers
to remain on the sidelines of a fight, directing the action and revising
his tactics second by second. Nothing gives him joy as much as a well-executed
ambush, or the swift, organized destruction of an Autobot base. When he
must get involves in a fight himself, he does so with cold fury, advancing
meticulously across the battlefield with his fire focused on the most dangerous
opponent. Every variable in a fight is taken into account in his mind,
every possibility assessed, and every contingency planned for.
