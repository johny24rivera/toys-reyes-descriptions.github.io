    Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode of a Western Star truck cab is reproduced fairly faithfully for his
Power Battler version... if you look at it from the front, at least. The
proportions are very close to ideal, and from the front at least there's
no robot kibble visible. This all changes when you look at this mode from
the back, though-- the back third or so of the cab is VERY clearly Optimus
Prime's arms, with the rear four wheels pretty much just molded onto the
sides of them. There's even only robot upper arms connecting that back
section to the center portion. On a lesser note, when looked at from a
rear view, one can clearly see Optimus' face and upper chest inside the
main body of the cab, which is a little distracting. As far as the colors
go, they're pretty classic Optimus-- dark blue, red, and gray (unfortunately
that ugly light milky shade of gray that's used way too often on TFs these
days). The dark blue plastic has a bit of a swirly, semi-metallic glint
to it-- I rather like this shade. The light red is pretty straightforward,
though it's light enough where when it's painted on the dark blue plastic,
the blue "bleeds" through a bit and makes the red look a little darker
than it actually is. There's also some silver paint on the front roof section,
but other than that and the flames this mode is really lacking in paint
apps, which is a real shame given how intricate the mold detailing is in
places. The little traction bits on the side steps, the side tanks, the
smokestacks, the front grill... all are begging to get some black and/or
silver paint, but there isn't any. I will say that the windows look surprisingly
good unpainted, given that they're dark blue plastic.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
is fairly simple, most of it involving folding out the truck halves from
the center and them moving around a few panels. I do like that the grill
panel has a tab to firmly stick it in Optimus' lower back, and that the
smokestacks actually fold back to form heels, to keep him nice and stable.
That said, the roof panels don't really hide themselves very well on the
lower legs, and the tabs that are supposed to lock them in place in this
mode aren't as solid as I'd like. From the FRONT, this mode looks... okay.
I guess. Anything above the knees looks pretty decent and fairly proportional,
with excellent mold detailing on the chest and upper legs specifically--
despite the smaller size, nearly all of Optimus' chest bits like the small
circles, "skirt" armor, and the like are replicated quite well. That said,
his chest does stick out from in front of his head a bit too far, and though
his arms also look pretty good when it comes to the mold detailing, they're
raised a bit too much, like Optimus is permanently in a "What you lookin'
at, punk?!" pose. The lower legs, though, look terrible, ESPECIALLY if
you look at them from the side. There's no getting around it. From the
sides, they look like the hollow truck halves that they are with a couple
of odd panels sticking out. From the front, they don't align with the upper
legs, the center portions are waaay too obviously the front sections of
the truck mode, and the parts that are supposed to be his "feet" have incorrect
detailing and are way too long. They're just a mess, really. Although Optimus'
paint is a bit more plentiful in this mode-- what with the red and dark
blue detailing on the chest, and the light red detailing on the lower arms--
there's still some parts on his chest and upper legs that are begging for
some silver paint. All this ugly light milky gray just looks bad. For Optimus
Prime's Power Battler gimmick, he has "Sword Strike" action-- if you squeeze
his legs together, his arms will fold back behind his back a bit while
fake, all-gray arms fold forward over his shoulders, holding a dark blue
sword that's stuck in their grip. Given how the regular arms are still
clearly visible and how odd these "fake" arms look, this action feature
looks... really weird and is just another awful aspect of this mold. For
articulation, Optimus Prime's shoulders and knees can move outward, and
he can rotate at his elbows. Other than the elbows, that's pretty much
no useful articulation... that's bad, even for a Power Battler.

    Unfortunately, Optimus
Prime is pretty much the worst of the Power Battlers. His truck mode is
small for the size class, with not enough paint and very obvious robot
extras on the back end. In robot mode, he's got extremely awkward legs,
pretty much no normal articulation, and an incredibly bad action gimmick.
Unless you're an Optimus completist, there's really no reason to get this
toy-- if you're looking for a simplfied AoE Prime, get the
