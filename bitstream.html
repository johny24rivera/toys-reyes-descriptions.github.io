     Bitstream is one of the
lesser-known Seekers-- so lesser-known, in fact, that he didn't even have
an official name until this release. He was one of the myriad random "background"
Seekers seen in the first episodes of the G1 TV show. A few changes were
made from how he briefly appeared in the show, though-- his blue, as opposed
to being dark like on the show, is a swirly, semi-metallic-looking shade
of aquamarine on the toy. This is a really, REALLY nice plastic color,
and helps to differentiate Bitstream from
     <a href="bcthundercracker.html">
      "Classics"
Thundercracker
     </a>
     quite well. He also had blue lower arms and white hands
in the show, and that's not the case here-- like with the other Seekers
in this troop builder set, he has the exact same paint apps and plastic
colors as the other two when it comes to everything but his main color.
Bitstream's got white on the upper legs, the middle of the missile launchers
and the triggers, and on a few minor connector pieces. He's also got the
normal dark red-and-white Seeker stripes along his main wings, tailfins,
and robot shoulders. Additionally, he has a transparent yellow cockpit
window that fits in with the other Classics Seekers, some silver on the
intakes, the knees, the inside of the toes and face, and the landing gear.
For black, he's got some on the nosecone, head, lower arms, feet, and part
of the lower legs, rear thrusters, and a few other minor paint apps here
and there. He also has just a bit of dark red on the eyes and the intakes.
The end result looks quite good-- the aquamarine is just the right shade
to contrast extremely well with pretty much all of the other colors (except
maaaybe the dark red, and even then it doesn't clash).

     Bitstream's aquamarine
color is fantastic and works extremely well with the paint apps and colors
that the other Seekers in the this pack have-- this is my favorite out
of this "troop builder" set. I would've preferred some distinct paint apps--
like, say, some 0s and 1s tampographed in a pattern on his wings akin to
the green symbols in "The Matrix" movies-- but I understand for his first
toy, many fans would want him to be more slavish to G1. Definitely recommended,
though given how quickly this set sold out, be prepared to pay a premium
for him.

       Bitstream is a technology genius, skilled
in data hacking and cyber warfare. He was one of the first Decepticons
to crack the new Autobot encryption codes, leading them to declare victory
in the "Tarn Valley Ambush".

       Occasionally Bitstream becomes so engulfed
by the virtual world that he can mistake it for reality. More than once
his Cybertronic brainwaves have had to be forcefully removed from the cyber
world, so that he could deal with more physical threats.
