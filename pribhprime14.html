    Optimus Prime is technically
a new mold, though unlike his wavemate Predaking, he's a scaled-up version
of an existing mold, with a few minor changes made for the larger size.
In particular this is a blown-up version of the
    <a href="pricybhprime.html">
     Cyberverse
version
    </a>
    of the same design, so see my review of that for a more in-depth
review of the mold's pluses and minuses itself. Regarding this toy itself,
the weapons are new, though the basic idea and design of them is taken
from
    <a href="pricybbprime.html">
     Beast Blade Optimus Prime's
    </a>
    accessories;
he's got a very similar (though sadly unpainted) sword, a large spiky shield
with a modified Autobot symbol in the middle of it, and a push missile
launcher. Given the increased size, the latter has the biggest mold changes,
with an extra slider added to help pop out that missile with a decent amount
of force. The shield has also been changed a bit-- sorry, but no longer
do wings split open from under the shield, it's just one large piece now.
There are a few other, more minor, changes. The robot head details have
been refined a bit more-- a big plus, given how mushy the head details
on the original version of this design's were. There's also weapon mounting
points on the side of the right arm and on Optimus Prime's butt, in addition
to the ones already there on the commander class Beast Hunters Prime toy.
The shoulder joints have been remolded to be friction joints and not ball
joints, and in addition to swiveling at the sides the elbows also have
strong ratcheting joints. Additionally, the hips are no longer ball joints,
but instead friction joints and a ratchet joint; the knee joint is also
a ratcheting joint, as well, so this is a pretty sturdy, solid toy. It's
also HUGE for a voyager, just like his wavemate Predaking; Hasbro could
just barely fit this guy in a Voyager box! Despite being the same price
as the
    <a href="pribhprime.html">
     original voyager Beast Hunters Optimus
Prime
    </a>
    toy, he's about halfway between the size of that and the
    <a href="priultbhprime.html">
     Ultimate
version
    </a>
    of the design, making him a rather incredible value. Despite
being a "blown up" figure, the mold largely works pretty well at this scale,
with all of the necessary mold detailing still being there; he doesn't
look too overly simple like some other 2014 Beast Hunters figures. All
this said, a few things that were more minor on a commander-class toy are
eyesores on a toy this large. For one, having the smokestacks and parts
of the windows on his shoulders-- which also have, inaccurately, wheels
on them-- is a minor eyesore. The large hollow section in the back half
of his vehicle mode and the obvious fists are now a major eyesore at this
scale, too.

    As far as color scheme
goes, this version of Optimus Prime-- for the most part-- doesn't deviate
from the normal, with red, dark blue, and gray being his main three colors.
The gray is thankfully of a rather nice, semi-metallic shade, making it
look a little more interesting than your average gray plastic. The bronze
headlights and sky blue windows also contrast against the red on the truck
front/upper robot very well, and I'm glad that the hubs of his wheels are
now painted silver, along with some nice detailing on his face and eyes,
as well. The dark gunmetal gray paint on Prime's fists is a nice choice,
being a rather "metallic black" that helps them fit in with his wheels.
Optimus' legs could've really used some more paint detailing in robot mode,
but other than that he's got a pretty good diversity of color. The only
issues here are the regular and translucent pale green plastic, used for
his weapons, front spiky grill, and a few minor connector parts that make
themselves known in robot mode. Particularly the solid version of the color
is just a rather ugly shade, and clashes a bit with the red, being as light
as it is. I appreciate that they tried to differentiate the color scheme
a bit for this version of Optimus, but honestly with this differentiation
I would've preferred the old gray in place of this ugly of a shade of green.

    The 2014 "simplfied"
version of Beast Hunters Optimus Prime makes the upsize from commander
class surprisingly well, though he's still certainly not without his faults,
such as the very ugly shade of green he has, the obvious robot extras in
vehicle mode, and the inaccurate shoulders. The mold changes made to his
joints make him very sturdy indeed, and the huge size for a voyager is
another bonus. Recommended for kids who want a larger, simpler Beast Hunters
Optimus (way more than I'd recommend the Ultimate version); that said,
for most collectors I think the 2013 voyager Beast Hunters Prime is a bit
better in terms of the mold.
