    Optimus Prime's Animated
vehicle mode comes out looking fair for a Happy Meal toy, all things considered.
The proportions are fairly good, though the wheels poke out a bit too much
from the sides and look a little doofy, especially since they aren't painted
black and don't actually roll (there's much smaller wheels on the underside
that accomplish that). That side, though, Prime has a pretty good amount
of paint for a Happy Meal toy-- all the necessary details on the front,
like the windows and headlights and grill, are all painted up, which are
all the major features. You could always use more paint, such as the side
windows or rooflights, but those are minor nitpicks when you consider the
price of this thing. Other than a few odd proportional things like an overly
bulky rear end, there are no real robot extras EXCEPT for the robot fists
visible on the back end of the cab.

    Surprisingly, Optimus
Prime's robot mode isn't all that bad either, (all together now) for a
Happy Meal toy, and is in fact overall a little better than the alt mode.
The proportions are still more or less pretty good, the only real exception
here being his arms being overly blocky and hollow on the top half nad
a bit too small on the bottom half due to the transformation. I wish the
legs were one big uni-leg, but they're still pretty proportionally solid,
and the way the "robo-boots" slide out of the legs to give him a more solid
stance works quite well. I do not like his head sculpt, though-- though
it has a pretty good amount of paint on it, it doesn't have the Animated
style. It's sort of like a normal "serious" style but with a chin that
even looks a bit big for Animated. It's just off. Prime's articulation
also is pretty bad even for a Happy Meal toy-- he can move forwards at
the elbows and rotate his shoulders backward a bit, but that's it.

    Happy Meal Animated
Prime is the only Animated McDonald's toy that doesn't horribly suffer
in both modes. Sure, he's got problems, like a severe lack of articulation--
he IS a low-budget Happy Meal toy, after all-- but his proportions are
pretty solid in both modes, and he isn't severely lacking in paint apps
either like some of his Happy Meal Animated kin. My personal favorite of
the McAnimated toys.
