     Taken by himself, Deathsaurus
has an awesome color scheme. Black, blue, silver and red go together SO
well, and he's got tons of accent colors to spice things up even more.
The chrome hasn't been prone to chipping yet, though I haven't been playing
with him particularly hard yet, but it's a positive thing so far. The teal-on-black
detailing looks especially cool, as do the muddy gold paint apps on his
upper legs. In place of RiD Megatron's Predacon spark crystal, he's got
a solid yellow Decepticon spark crystal in his place instead. The "bat
maw" in his chest has also been removed, as it's useless on the new head
anyways, and the head has been completely redesigned to look like the original
Deathsaurus, who was a popular Japanese character. Some have complained
about the forehead not being angular enough when compared to the G1 version,
but you have to remember that Deathsaurus' head fits into his chest, so
that limits the dimensions of it-- given the parameters the designers had
to work with, I think the head turned out pretty good. The head definitely
has an evil, but experienced, look to it-- definitely suiting for a Decepticon
leader. However, Deathsaurus cannot be taken "just by himself", as he is
a repaint of an older toy. And comparing his color scheme to RiD Megatron's,
it is FAR too similar, especially for a convention-exclusive toy. Megatron's
purple has been replaced with blue, the gold with yellow and/or silver,
and a few other minor changes, but that's really it. For all intents and
purposes, it looks like RiD Megatron under odd lighting with a different
head, and that's not how an exclusive toy should look. Even just changing
the black to gray and the transparent red to, I dunno, orange or something,
would have not only made Deathsaurus look much more unique, it would've
been more accurate to his original version as well. It rather irks me that
such obvious color changes were not done, especially considering one of
the color schemes this mold has had previously. Also, one last thing--
Deathsaurus still has all the modes that RiD Megatron and
     <a href="galvatron.html">
      Galvatron
     </a>
     have, but only a few are pictured to conserve web space and since many
of them are so similar anyways, you can easily figure out what he looks
like in his other modes.

     Deathsaurus is a fine
toy in his own right, but he's far too like RiD Megatron for a convention
toy, and is rather dissapointing as the centerpiece of the core "Descent
into Evil" convention set for a collector who already has RiD Megatron.
I think he's one of the least impressive exclusives this year because of
this fact, which is a shame, as he had a lot of good potential.

       After his defeat centuries ago by the
Autobot Star Saber, Deathsaurus was recreated as one of the Generals in
the Decepticon army. Having led many successful campaigns, he became frustrated
as the Autobots and Maximals began to overwhelm the Decepticon/Predacon
Alliance. His ultimate goal is to re-establish his title of Emperor of
Destruction and return the Decepticon Empire to its former prominence.
Savage, cruel and brilliant, Deathsaurus should never be underestimated.
Deathsaurus hopes to use his Insecticon Clones to increase his power base.

       Abilities: Deathsaurus' new form was
engineered to have six distinct transforms including a dragon mode, an
aerial vehicle mode and a high-speed ground mode. These forms, along with
his dual Energon blade weapon make him a formidable foe. Utilizing the
unique materials in his wings, he can convert sunlight into dark energy,
which will corrode any type of metal upon contact. Deathsaurus is one of
the strongest Decepticons.
