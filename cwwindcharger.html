    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Tailgate.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Legends
Tailgate

     Since the original Tailgate
was remolded from G1 Windcharger, now it's Windcharger's turn to get remolded
from Generations Tailgate! Windcharger is largely on-the-nose when it comes
to his color scheme, which is primarily red and black with a bit of gray
and silver in there. It's hardly an original or particularly exciting color
scheme, but the contrast between the black and red is done well. The red
plastic used for this version of Windcharger is a rather nice shade of
the color, being rather dark but with bit of a milky, semi-metallic tint
to it. The gray mostly shows up in robot mode and is largely unexciting,
though the flat gunmetal gray paint used on Windcharger's chest is a good
color that "bridges the gap" between the gray and black plastic. He has
some silver paint on his headlights and for the detailing that's supposed
to represent his exposed vehicle engine, as well as on his face-- nice
enough, though his taillights and/or grill could've used some paint. Having
all four windows painted black (yes, even the rear window) looks nice as
well, and the combination of silver paint against the blue eyes on Windcharger's
head is also a nice color combo to boot.

     One mold change has
been made to Windcharger, and that's a new headsculpt, which looks largely
G1 cartoon-accurate and has a fairly neutral expression-- however, given
the head size allowable for the toy, it means that his head looks rather
small proportionally, and thus looks out-of-place.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Combiner Wars Windcharger
is a decent enough recolor of a medicore Legends mold, but the body type
in robot mode just doesn't fit Windcharger like it does Tailgate, the latter
of which has a more dainty, skinny appearance in more recent IDW comics,
unlike the more normally-proportioned Windcharger. This-- combined with
the lack of a little partner figure despite being the same price as Tailgate
and having a small head mold-- makes this release of the mold definitely
inferior to Tailgate, in my opinion. It may cost you a bit more, but I'd
highly recommend finding the
     <a href="aawindcharger.html">
      Reveal the Shield
version
     </a>
     of Windcharger instead, as that's a far superior and far more
fitting mold-- only get this mold as a last resort if you must fill in
this gap in your collection and can't find the RtS version.
