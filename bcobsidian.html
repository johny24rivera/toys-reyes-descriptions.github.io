not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Highbrow.

     Since Obsidian's original
     <a href="obsidian.html">
      Beast
Machines form
     </a>
     was a fictional helicopter, re-making him into a older
style of plane with two rotors works really well in terms of a more "realistic"
alt mode, given his general personality-- it's a nice homage without being
a slavish update. (Or, should, I say, his Beast Machines version is the
update-- the Botcon Machine Wars comic takes place well before Beast Machines,
so that's why Obsidian is an Autobot. This is where he earned his reputation
as an awesome general.) Anyways, FunPub has done an excellent job on FINALLY
getting an Obsidian toy with a color scheme that is quite accurate to how
he appeared in the BM television series. He's mostly a dull, bluish shade
of gray, with a fair amount of greenish blue paint as well, the latter
making itself particularly obvious in robot mode. He's also got a fair
amount of black for some small connecting pieces as well as his machine
guns, missiles, and some wiring on his waist. (All this said, I wish there
was a little more black paint on his robot hips or something, to help hint
at his future very "wiry" frame.) Although the bluish gray and bluish green
complement each other well, by itself this would be a fairly dull color
scheme, but Obsidian also has a fair amount of "cheese" yellow paint on
him-- most notably on the rings surrounding his cockpit, but also on some
small connector bits in robot mode and around his shoulders and lower chest.
The way the black, yellow, and greenish blue all come together on his chest
paint apps looks really nice, and really makes the chest look as much like
his BM show form as you could on a mold not specifically made for him.
There's also a fair amount of red for some "pop", from the rather normal
shade of red for the rear tailfins/feet and nosecone, a more pale version
of the color used as his rotors, and a nice transparent cherry red on his
cockpit. All in all he looks remarkably like his BM show version in both
modes, despite being a toy not at all designed to look like him.

     Obsidian does have one
mold change, and that's a new head mold. Other than the length-- Obsidian's
head is a bit more "normally" proportioned and not as long as in the BM
show for space reasons in vehicle mode-- this new headsculpt is AMAZINGLY
spot-on, with just the right amount of details-- lime green eyes, a red
mouth and "mustache", a yellow brow, and a black section in between his
brow and his mouth. It looks really well-done.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon 2013 Obsidian
is an absolutely ingenious reuse of the Highbrow mold, with the colors
spot-on, a good number of paint apps, an incredible head-sculpt and a look
that just nails the character as much as you possibly could in both modes
in lieu of a toy specifically made for Obsidian himself. FINALLY, a large,
color-accurate toy for probably my favorite TF character of all time. Definitely
my favorite toy of the boxset and-- for character reasons-- the whole Botcon
2013 set.

       Obsidian has a cunning mind adept at
forming the most brilliant battlefield strategies. For the longest time,
he stayed in the shadows, carefully formulating the countermeasures that
would enable the Autobots to wrest control of Cybertron away from Shockwave
and Megatron. After Unicron's attack in the year 2005, Obsidian led the
Autobot forces who expelled the remaining Decepticons from the planet.
Since becoming a more public figure, he has led many successful campaigns
against Decepticon incursions of Cybertron and has been decorated with
the highest military honors.

       While Obsidian's best-known weapon is
his mind, he is also well trained in many forms of combat. He is a student
of not just the history of the Cybertronian wars, but those of Earth and
Nebulos as well. He even recently took a modified P-38 Lightning Earth
plane as his alternate mode. He is an expert in low altitude aerial combat,
and is capable of shelling the battlefields below with machine gun fire
and ground penetrating missiles while also engaging enemy fliers in tremendous
dogfights. In robot mode, Obsidian is skilled at Kratomechafora, which
allows a combatant to use an opponent's own physical strength against himself.
