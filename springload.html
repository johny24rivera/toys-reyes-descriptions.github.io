    Springload's vehicle
mode is a picku-- waaaaitaminute. This isn't Springload's vehicle mode
in the show! In the show, Springload's vehicle mode is an old rickety pickup
truck. This version has his alt mode as a monster truck! Well, that kinda
stinks. I mean, I like monster trucks, but that's kind of a big difference
from the show. Regardless, the monster truck mode is pretty well-done overall,
with pretty decent proportions. The only real proportional issue I see
is that the top of the truck doesn't come up above the body quite enough,
so the windows aren't as tall as they should be. From a straight-on side
view, you can also see just a bit of Springload's legs, but this isn't
visible from the vast majority of normal angles, so I find this a minor
downside. The mold detailing on most of the vehicle mode is fairly minimal,
as is typical of RID2015 toys, but there's a couple of relatively intricate
details. The grill on the front has some nifty angular details on it; there's
little vents on the sides behind the doors; and the wheels have some interesting
curved treads that look pretty cool. I LOVE how Springload's red eyes peak
up just a titch from the front hood, with the grill looking like a clenched
mouth. Normally I wouldn't like those obvious eyes in vehicle mode, but
here it's all done fairly well, like he's "peeking out". As for the color
scheme as a whole, the vast majority of this mode is a quite nice shade
of light milky forest green, which of course fits a frog-former pretty
well. There's a little bit of pale light green seen near the back end,
but it's not very prominent in this mode. As for a monster truck, they're
all kinds of crazy colors so it fits one as much as any another, I suppose.
Beyond the black tires and metallic black paint on the windows (but not
the rear window, alas), there's also some light blue paint on the rims
above the wheels, silver on the grill, and some light metallic blue on
the headlights. My favorite color is the metallic leafy green stripe down
the center of the front hood; I really wish it was used more often on the
toy, it really attracts the eye. A couple of details-- like the rear "bars"
behind the windows and the taillights-- are begging for some paint, particularly
on the back half. There's a bit too much unbroken light milky green plastic
back there as is.

    To transform Springload
to beast mode, you pull apart his vehicle mode at the back legs, and the
rest auto-transforms by itself. The end result is.... okay, I suppose,
but compared to the show model it's a bit inaccurate and the proportions
are definitely off. For one thing, the entire front section of the vehicle
mode-- including the front two wheels-- just hangs unceremoniously above
and behind his head and on top of his body. It's a pretty substantial eyesore,
though then again this is fairly accurate to the show model (though it's
larger on the toy than on the model). The main body of the toy is unchanged,
but the frog face is now revealed totally (not just the eyes), with a large
maw with some oddly angular silver teeth, which I... would definitely not
expect on a frog. I really wish the large mouth was painted red or something
to emphasize it more, and the eyebrows also need to be painted as they're
pretty loudly emphasized on the show model (and larger than they are on
this toy, as well). The back end is a bit messy, given that the sides of
the vehicle mode are very obviously just... well.. chunks of the vehicle
mode. They're situated like slightly splayed back legs, of course, but
they mostly don't look like legs. The actual legs that flip out from under
the toy for this mode are definitely too small proportionally, especially
for a frog, and just look off. It's especially kind of weird given that
the rear legs have wheels for feet (as is accurate to the show model),
but they're way too small and not detailed in terms of paint, and are right
next to the REAL wheels on the sides of the back legs. I'm not too fond
of the shade of green used for the legs, either; it's a bit too pale and
ugly, like it's faded in the sun. Without any paint, they look even worse.
And to add even MORE insult on top of injury, the front two legs don't
lock into place-- if you pick Springload up, the legs just kinda dangle
there, moving slightly back-and-forth below his body without ever sticking
into one spot. It's honestly a bit annoying, especially since this mode
has no real articulation. No leg articulation, and even though it LOOKS
like Springload can chomp down on his jaw, if you do so it starts to auto-transform
him back to vehicle mode, which is a shame.

    Springload is one of
my favorite RID2015 designs--
    <i>
     on the show
    </i>
    . THIS toy falls woefully
short in both modes. In vehicle mode, Springload's pretty decent, but is
completely inaccurate to the show; in robot mode, Springload's just mostly
an inaccurate mess with large obvious truck parts, an inaccurately-sculpted
head, and laughably tiny legs. Get the Legion class version instead.
