    Lockdown's vehicle mode
is a licensed Lambourghini Aventador, and as you'd expect from a licensed
alt mode, he looks pretty darned good and proportional in this mode. There
really aren't any robot mode extras at all in this mode, not even if you
look in the windows-- granted, there aren't molded-in seats in there, but
the parts that are visible in there are mostly hinges and the like and
not obvious robot bits. The main color of a dark milky greenish brown really
doesn't look good to me-- I would've preferred a color closer to black--
but on the other hand, the milky, semi-glossy appearance of the plastic
doesn't look half bad. The transparent blue used for the front and rear
windows (the side windows are mostly open) looks fantastic against the
greenish brown. The silvery blue headlights, black bits on the front and
rear bumpers, red taillights, and little gold Lamboughini logo on the front
hood help to break up the colors a bit, but some additional paint was still
needed on the figure in this mode, as there are some LARGE areas of just
the greenish brown plastic. The tires also could've used painted spokes,
as well. The mold detailing, as you'd expect, is minimal in this mode,
given the look of the Aventador and the sleekness of it, but a couple of
places like the wheels are well-detailed. Lockdown's weapon is a rather
large, long gun that can fire a push-missile. It looks nice and has a ton
of excellent mold detailing, but it was definitely made for the robot mode
first, as it just sort of pegs along the top of this mode, which looks
rather awkward on such a sleek vehicle. I wish there had been some way
to store the weapon underneath the car, instead.

    Lockdown's transformation
to robot mode is almost exactly the same as
    <a href="dotmroadbuster.html">
     DotM
deluxe Roadbuster's
    </a>
    , though the back end folds up a bit better on ol'
Lockdown and the rear pieces of the car mode form some bulk to his shoulders.
By themselves, the different parts of Lockdown look passable-to-good. The
legs in particular are the best part, being quite movie-accurate (minus
the wheels sticking of the hips so much), and I especially love the two-toed
feet and all the wonderful shock absorbers and the like detailed on him.
The legs aren't quite thick or long enough proportionally, though. The
chest and head are the next-most-impressive part with the sides of the
Aventador headlights forming obvious sides of the chest-- but this isn't
at all how it looks in the movie, despite the panel of robot mode detailing
that covers up the center of the chest. It makes him look like he has a
bit too much mass near the bottom of his chest/stomach. The headsculpt
is quite well-done, but not QUITE movie-accurate-- like it's going off
an earlier rendition of Lockdown, when his face was slightly more skull-like
than his final movie design. His scar isn't present, and the structure
of his head is just a bit... different, really. The arms are the most disappointing
part-- the upper part looks fine, if slightly movie inaccurate, but at
deluxe scale it is NOT cool for the main villain of the movie to merely
have his hands detailed on the sides of car doors-- with the car doors
even at the bottom of the hands, preventing one from slotting a weapon
entirely through one of his hand holes! It just looks awful, and Lockdown's
robot mode proportions are a bit wonky, too-- his head's too small in proportion
to his chest, and his arms are too long, reaching down to his knees easily
and giving him almost a gorilla-like appearance in that respect. He's also
just too darned short and small in general as a toy-- in the movie, he's
nearly as tall as Optimus Prime, and having his "mainline toy" be a deluxe
is just unacceptable, especially given how awesome of a character he was
in the movie and a formidable threat. That said, there are definitely more
visible paint apps in this mode to liven up his color scheme a bit more,
with silver on his face, lower arms, stomach, and upper legs, with some
additional pale metallic gold on his upper legs. Then there's the black
on his chest, and the metallic silvery blue from his headlights on the
sides of his chest. His eyes do have light piping, but it's the wrong color
(it should be green), and it doesn't work that well anyways-- the slot
for the light to come through is too small. For articulation, Lockdown
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
hips (at two points-- one is shared among both legs, meaning if you move
one forward the other will too unless you keep your hand on the other leg
to keep it still), and at the knees (at two points) and slightly back-and-forth
at the ankles. It's decent articulation, but not extraordinary-- some more
articulation in the arms and perhaps some waist rotation would've been
appreciated. Lockdown's large weapon from vehicle mode can be held in his
hands but-- yes indeed-- it can be slotted over and fit on top of his head
firmly to replicate the "gunface" he does in the movie! It looks awesome
and is definitely the highlight of the toy, in my opinion-- I honestly
didn't expect Hasbro would do that.

    AoE deluxe Lockdown
has a pretty good car mode and some excellent details-- and his head-gun
gimmick is pretty darned awesome. As a MOLD, he's okay, with decent articulation,
even though his robot mode proportions are a little out of whack. However,
as a representation of LOCKDOWN, he falls far short, being far smaller,
shorter, and far less imposing in his proportions and look than he does
in the movie. As such, he's one of my biggest disappointments in the AoE
line, for the main villain character to get a "merely okay" too-small deluxe
toy that can in no way go toe-to-toe with any mainline Prime toy.
