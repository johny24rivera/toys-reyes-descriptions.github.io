    Hun-Gurrr has now gotten
a more G1-accurate toy compared to his various "updates" in the past, with
his robot mode being a two-headed dragon that honestly looks an awful lot
like the robot mode laying down with some front legs flipped out, once
you're familiar with how the robot mode looks. The front legs, even though
they weren't big on the G1 toy, are absolutely laughably small here, especially
compared with the quite large rear legs. It's here on these rear legs you
might recognize bits and pieces of Hun-Gurrr-- some of his engineering
and a few of his parts are taken from the
    <a href="cwsilverbolt.html">
     Combiner
Wars Silverbolt
    </a>
    design, but sooo much has been changed I think it's
a stretch to even call it an extensive remold-- a few other parts like
what becomes the upper robot legs are re-used, but by and large he's a
new toy. The rear legs are the robot arms quite obviously, but this time
they've had little "paw pieces" added to the bottom so they can become
decent beast legs. There's a tail on the back end, but it's pretty small,
and although I appreciate that little stegosaurus-like scale-plates pop
up from them for this mode, they're still small plates and just needed
to be bigger proportionally. The main body has some bigger scale-plates,
but there's some pretty obvious kibble on the stomach-- what becomes the
chest of the torso mode. Here it just makes Hun-Gurrr look like he's got
a real gut... which I suppose isn't so out-of-character, but here the shape
just looks odd. The two heads are definitely the strongest part of this
mode, as they're long, well-articulated, and both look pretty decent. The
only real issue with the dragon heads stems from the quandary that there's
small panels on the top that either A. can give Hun-Gurrr an extra plates
on each head, or B. can cover up the obvious combiner ports on the rear
of each neck piece. Unfortunately they can't do both. The mold detailing
on Hun-Gurr is come-and-go, with some places being surprisingly sparse
(like parts of his main body), while some of the molded-in details on the
front legs, parts of the neck, and rear legs are pretty darned intricate.
The colors on Hun-Gurrr are mostly bone-white and gray in this mode, but
this WAS a toy released in the mid-to-late '80s, so of course he's gotta
have some pink on him. The plastic and the paint colors are definitely
a bit different, however-- the paint is slightly more of a purple shade
than a pink shade, while the plastic is exactly the opposite. It's not
that big of a mis-match in this mode, but in torso mode where these bits
meet up more obviously it can become a minor eyesore. The pink-purple really
does make the color scheme considerably more interesting, though, helping
to spice up what would otherwise be a drab color scheme-- painting all
the stegosaur-like plates this color also really helps with the color breakup,
along with some more of that paint on the front legs and bits on what become
the robot chest. There's silver on the rear legs, but nowhere else obvious
in this mode. There's some red used on the beast eyes, but again nowhere
else, so neither of them contribute to the overall colors much. There are
some nice red mechanical detail stickers used on the sides of each neck,
though, which look great-- and I'm not one for foil stickers, normally.
There's also little red-and-silver stickers on the top of each head, and
oddly mismatching Decepticon emblem stickers on what becomes each robot
shoulder. For articulation in this mode, Hun-Gurrr can move at the bottom
of each neck (at three points), the mid-point of each neck (at two points),
at the base of the each head (at two points), at the jaws, at the shoulders
of each front leg, at the hips on the rear legs (at two points), the rear
knees (at two points), and slightly at the ankles, although you have to
un-hinge the paw pieces a bit to do so. Of course, just like other Power
of the Primes voyagers, Hun-Gurr comes with two "Prime Armor" pieces (i.e.,
glorified Combiner feet), with a yellow-sprayed "Matrix" piece you can
slot into either of them (those slots can also hold Prime or Titan Masters).
They don't really serve any use in the normal beast and robot modes, though,
and so the only real way to use them here is to plug them into the sides
of the rear legs and just let them stay there kind of awkwardly, or just
put them aside.

    Hun-Gurrr's transformation
is very simple, especially for a Generations voyager-class toy. Just stand
him up on his two dragon heads (which splay apart at the jaws to form the
feet), flip back the paw pieces to reveal hands as you make his rear legs
his robot arms, fold back the front dragon legs into his back, and then
rotate the tail over onto the top to become part of the chest while you
fold up his head. It really is an awful lot like the beast mode standing
up-- a heck of a lot of the details are the same, as well as the color
layout. What was a piece of pink-purple kibble on the stomach in beast
mode is now on his back. It does stick out a bit from Hun-Gurrr's general
body, but it doesn't get in the way of articulation much and isn't TOO
blatant, so I consider it a minor downside. The proportions in this mode
are great, and given all the compromises made in beast mode, in robot mode
Hun-Gurrr looks pretty awesome and proportional. The tail on the chest,
even though it's facing the opposite direction, still has stegosaur-like
plates sticking up from the center, which is a nice little touch and helps
make his chest area more unique. The rear paw pieces unfortunately just
hang below his fists unceremoniously, so they look kinda bad, but the detailing
on the fists is pretty good. The pink robot head is pretty G1-accurate,
with a relatively angular aesthetic, along with some minor vents to the
sides and on the forehead. He has a "normal" face, but a silver-painted
visor with an indentation for his nose. It's a nice headsculpt, although
I think it hardly befits a monster like Hun-Gurrr. A bit of nice light
metallic blue paint is now visible on the shoulders, but other than that,
the fists, and the head, not much is visible or unique about this mode
that wasn't visible in beast mode. For articulation, he can move at the
neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), hips (at three
points), knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points), so given his
general lack of kibble and good proportions, he's very poseable. The Prime
armor bits, again, don't really do anything but just hang off the lower
arms if you want, giving him arm-guards at best, and not really interacting
with the rest of the toy at all in this mode. He really needed a real weapon.

    Hun-Gurrr shares a few
pieces and many general structural similarities with Combiner Wars Silverbolt,
but in his torso mode as Abominus is where it really shows. Abominus largely
has the same proportions here as the torso mode of Silverbolt (or his multiple
remolds), with a rather wide chest that narrows down to a fairly slim waist,
and then upper legs that jut out from the sides of the waist and are formed
from the robot arms. Given that Hun-Gurrr becomes a two-headed dragon and
not a jet in alt mode, however, there are certainly some differences. For
one, the rear beast mode claws just flip out behind the combiner ports
on the bottom; they don't peg in anywhere, they just kinda hang back there
unceremoniously and rather obviously. There isn't a big jetwing backpack
on this version, with the only thing on the back really being the tail
tip that comes up from the waist on the back end-- thus, if you look at
Hun-Gurrr from the back, yo can rather tell where most of his robot parts
are, like his upper legs and chest, and there's a hollow spot where his
robot abs would be. The Abominus chest sticks out a bit more, as it has
to hold a Prime Master, and instead of the chest piece fanning out to the
sides, instead it's the tiny beast front legs folded up to form the chest
sides this time around (with little Decepticon stickers on them visible
in this mode). The lower robot legs still form the sides of the main body,
but there's an extra panel that flips down from the shoulders to reveal
the combiner ports there and also gives Hun-Gurr a pair of extra scales
on the sides in this mode, a nice little extra. There's plenty of extra
molded-in details on the chest and waist piece-- quite an impressive amount,
really. There's technical details all over the place as well-- the coolest
of which are the turbine-like details on the waist-- and many decorative
lines as well, particularly on the waist. The waist piece behind the flap
is also covered in tube-like lines, and looks pretty cool. The combined
mode headsculpt has a pretty stern look to it, with two large (rubbery)
antennae poking up from the sides, a center forehead crest with turbine-like
details in it, vents on the side, a "normal" mouth and nose, and his eyes
that are connected like a visor, but indented a bit like individual eyes
as well. It's a pretty crisp, cool headsculpt. In this mode the purplish
pink/pinkish purple takes center stage as far as the colors go, with the
entire middle portion of the chest and the waist flap mostly this color.
Most of the rest of this mode that isn't painted/covered with stickers
is bone white plastic, except for the lower portion of the upper legs and
some minor connector parts, which are gray. The little fins on the side
of the body are also this color, as is Abominus' chin. There's silver on
the chest and waist flap on the sides, as well as some red on those chest
details to boot. Some yellow is evident on the waist flap too, and on Abominus's
eye/visor. Finally, the last revealed color is a bit of dark greenish blue
on the waist flap. Overall, this is definitely the most colorful of Hun-Gurrr's
modes, with all of these new paint apps on the chest, waist, and head mixing
in with all the other paint apps to produce quite a varied color scheme,
with a lot of nice highlight colors used in small amounts. In this mode
Hun-Gurrr/Abominus can move at the hips (at three points), rotate at the
head, and his antennae can move front-to-back a little as a side effect
of the transformation (both as one piece).

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Some aspects of Hun-Gurrr's
beast mode are pretty weak-- his ridiculously tiny front legs in particular--
but his robot mode and torso mode are both great, with few flaws/extras.
Even though I feel a few minor aspects of his design suffered from him
using the Combiner Wars Silverbolt "core", it generally has served the
toy well, and with a fairly nifty color scheme to boot (particularly in
torso mode), this is my favorite PotP voyager-class toy (at least that's
largely a new mold).
