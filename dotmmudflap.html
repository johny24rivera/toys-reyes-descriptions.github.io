    For his outing for the
third movie, Mudflap's given up his previous alt mode and taken the same
Chevy Spark alt mode as the more "dominant" twin
    <a href="dotmskids.html">
     Skids
    </a>
    ,
though to help differentiate them both in vehicle mode Mudflap has orange
stripes down the middle as opposed to Skids' green. Proportionally, there's
not much negative to say about this mode-- it looks pretty darned close
to a Chevy Spark, and the only real robot mode extras are the bits you
can barely see through Mudflap's tinted windows and the tips of his feet
poking down below the bottom of of the car. Other than perhaps the wheel
hubs, everything that needs to be painted on this toy in this mode is painted,
to boot. Of course there's the two orange stripes running down the length
of the body, which not only make it more visually interesting but serve
as a really nice contrast color against all the black-- however, the silver
headlights and silver-and-red taillights look pretty good too. Even the
little Chevrolet symbol on the front as well as the side mirrors are painted.
I will have to say, though, that due to Mudflap's transformation, it can
be rather difficult to get his side doors to line up just right in this
mode, which is a bit frustrating. Mudflap has two Mechtech ports in this
mode, both on the sides of the top of his roof. His actual Mechtech weapon
is a rather thick-barreled gun that, if you push back on the lever at the
top of the weapon, elongates out to form an axe. It's not all that impressive,
but it's not outright bad, either. Like nearly all Mechtech weapons, it
unfortunately can't stay locked into its "activated" axe mode, and reverts
back to gun mode as soon as you let go of the lever.

    Just like his twin's
Mechtech deluxe toy, Mudflap loses nearly all of his good looks in robot
mode. Granted, some of this is on purpose-- Mudflap is, after all, a doofy
character with slightly odd proportions, such as having feet a bit on the
large side, his left arm bigger than his right, and his ugly face sculpt
(that face.... ugh), but this goes above and beyond that. His hood hangs
off his back rather unceremoniously, not folding up much, and his car doors
hang out a bit too much behind his shoulders to really count much as simply
"contributing to his silouhette/uniqueness". (They also don't clip into
anything on his shoulders, and at least on mine the door pieces are on
ball joints that are rather loose, adding to the frustration.) His chest
sticks out a ridiculous amount in front of his head, even for a Transformer,
and his feet are a bit TOO large. This gives him good stability, of course,
but it still looks weird. Additionally, his front wheels are supposed to
"collapse" into his chest, but they do a pretty poor job of it-- a simple
look from a side angle has them just laying inside there a bit, at odd
angles to the chest. (From a side angle, one can also see how oddly long
his torso/waist piece is.) On the plus side, Mudflap's arms look pretty
good overall, and he's got a lot of mold detailing on his robot parts--
from pistons and vents to gears, it's all there. His head, waist, and chest
also have these details painted in quite well with silver and orange; his
legs and arms a bit less so, though. When it comes to articulation, Mudflap
can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at four points), elbows
(at two points), hips (at two points), and knees (at two points). So given
his good, stable feet, he can take up a decent number of poses, though
nearly all of them will still look doofy because of how odd his proportions
and kibble are. Mudflap gains two more Mechtech ports in this mode, in
the side of his lower arms; however, he also has a point on each shoulder
for a C-clip weapon, should you have those and want to pump up his weaponry
a bit.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    DotM deluxe Mudflap
has a pretty good vehicle mode and a nice color scheme, but his robot mode
is one that suffers from all sorts of problems-- odd proprtions and a lot
of kibble chief among them. I understand they wanted Mudflap's transformation
to be simpler this time around-- and it is-- but the end result is one
of the worst toys from the main line. Not recommended unless you're a completist
or a big Mudflap fan.

      Mudflap is quickly becoming a veteran
Autobot soldier, but there are days he cannot believe he's battling the
Decepticons shoulder-to-shoulder with Optimus Prime. Mudflap shows the
courage and enthusiasm of a distinguished Autobot even though the Decepticons
may have to wait a few years before they truly fear him.
