    Laserbeak is one of the
most unique toys in the Armada line, for three major reasons: First and
foremost, he has no Minicon interaction whatsoever. He's a completely "loner"
toy. Second, he's about the same size toy-wise as he is in the show (the
size of a child's digicam). Laserbeak's meant to be a roleplay toy of sorts
(hence the name of the size category), so its owner can pretend they're
Rad or Alexis or something. He's not to scale with the "normal" Armada
toys at all. Last but not least, Laserbeak is the only Armada toy that
has an animal alt mode- that of a mecha-bird.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Laserbeak's "digicam"
mode is probably the most convincing of his three modes. It's generally
the shape and size of a digicam (although most digicams don't have two
lenses shaped like that...). It has molded-in buttons (it's not a working
digicam, mind you), a flip-out "viewer" with a picture of Optimus Prime
pasted on the inside of it, and a cloth strap to put around your arm (if
your arm's small enough to fit in the strap, that is). There's also a nicely
molded, painted Autobot symbol on the rear. The colors are really what
I don't like. The bright orange and dark blue just... completely and totally
clash. Not to mention I've NEVER seen a bright orange camcorder in my life.
I liked Laserbeak's prototype color scheme of red and black MUCH better.
Supposedly, this was changed because of safety law reasons, because of
Laserbeak's gun mode, which I'll get to later. Laserbeak is also noticeably
lacking in detailing, both mold- and paint-wise. Although some of his "buttons"
are speaker are painted, much more detailing would have been appreciated,
especially on the buttons on the inside of the viewfinder and on the "face".
Although Laserbeak's mold detailing is... acceptable, I wouldn't go any
farther than that. Some large, undetailed areas make this look like too
simplistic of a toy for the Armada line. As for Laserbeak's sound gimmicks,
all except one can be activated in this mode, but only two are "meant"
to be. If you press the front gray button, Laserbeak will alternate between
a "rewinding" sound and a "snapping picture" sound. Neat, if not a bit
fuzzy.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Laserbeak's gun mode
is simple. Close the viewfinder, pull out the bottom trigger. Done. In
fact, it's TOO simple. The gun doesn't look like a gun at all, but a stubby
camera with a trigger. THIS was worth making the color scheme bright orange?
Uh-uh. Laserbeak has another sound buttom in this mode, on the trigger.
Press it and a shooting sound is made. Not spectacular, but not particularly
bad, either.

    Laserbeak's mecha-bird
mode takes... some getting used too, but it's not THAT bad. The weird-eyed
face with the two asymetrical lenses and no beak are what really throw
you off. Other than that, this mode is alright (ignoring the color scheme,
of course), and is rather identifiable as a bird. The cloth band also sorta
doubles as a tail. The transformation is mostly automatic, which is kinda
cool, but not overly impressive. The posability is pretty limited, though-
the head can move up and down, and the legs can move back and forth at
the ankles and hips. That's it. I suppose it you want to get technical,
Laserbeak can also "flap" his wings if you push them down and allow them
to pop back up via their spring mechanism, but that's pushing it. His feet
are somewhat stable in this mode, as long as you don't have them posed
too awkwardly. Laserbeak has four sound features available in this mode,
all of which can kind of apply to this mode; press the forward sound button
for the aforementioned two camera sound features. Press the back grey sound
button to cycle between a bird "screech" sound and an alternate firing
sound (I THINK Laserbeak can fire from his eyes in this mode....).
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overall, Laserbeak is
a nice gift for the young fan just getting into Transformers, but little
else. His transformation is TOO simplistic for the older kids and Transfans,
and he's not to scale with the other TF figures at all, limiting playability
a little. His colors, absence of Minicon interaction, awkward gun mode,
and sparse paint detailing don't help him out, either. He just seems like
he's in a completely different line than the rest of the toys. Thusly,
I'd only recommend him to little kids or completists.

      Laserbeak is a protective companion
for the Earth kids who become involved in the battle between the Transformers.
Given to the children by Optimus Prime, Laserbeak records information in
his spy bird mode and can launch fireblasts in his stun weapon mode. He
is always alert to his surroundings, scanning for threats. What will Laserbeak
discover during his spy missions that will help the Autobots defeat the
evil plans of the Decepticons?
