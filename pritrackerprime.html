    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime Weaponizer
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Prime Weaponizer Optimus Prime figure

     I'm not sure how exactly
this is supposed to be a "Beast Hunters"-era Optimus Prime considering
this is his pre-Beast Hunters body, but here it is. For the most part,
this release is remarkably similar to the original Weaponizer Prime-- the
dark blue, black, yellow, very light milky gray plastic, and general color
layout are all the same and on the same places on this toy when compared
to the original release. The only obvious difference is that the original's
red has been exchanged for a more "jungley" dark forest green (with one
additional green paint app on the robot stomach). It looks decent enough
when contrasting and complementing with the other colors; I have no issue
with it, though I think overall it doesn't look any better or worse than
the traditional Optimus red on the first use of this mold. Two more subtle
changes also exist for Beast Tracker Prime's color scheme; the pale silver
from the original is a more glossy, milky light gray on this version, and
the gray plastic mostly used for Optimus' chest in robot mode is of a noticeably
lighter shade than the darker coloration on the original. Both changes
don't really change the look of Optimus much considering how similar they
are, but I do think these two colors are slightly less eye-catching and
ever-so-slight downgrades.

     Beast Tracker Prime
does have one mold change, and that's the addition of a big "meat cleaver"
dragonslayer sword, pretty much identical in everything except size to
the one that comes with his
     <a href="priultbhprime.html">

     . No other mold changes have been made to the toy, though
unfortunately the electronics in the spinning shoulder cannons have been
completely removed.

     Beast Tracker Optimus
Prime is pretty much the perfect example of an uninspired, unneeded redeco.
The only major changes from the original are the exchanging of dark red
for dark green and the addition of a Beast Hunters-esque sword, the latter
of which completely fails to distract one away from the fact that this
is the
     <i>
      wrong body
     </i>
     for Beast Hunters-era Optimus. Add to all this
the gutted electronics and a $10 (U.S.) higher price tag with basically
nothing to show for it, and I'd only recommend this toy to the biggest
Optimus completists. Otherwise, this is an easy skip.
