    (NOTE: This review-- and the pictures above--
MAINLY covers the 7" "Alpha" size class, but with a few minor exceptions,
the larger toy is just an "upsize" of the smaller toy mold, so the review
can largely apply to both. Any significant changes between the two releases
will be covered in the review.)

     Optimus Prime's Discount
Store-exclusive "Authentics" version is basically his general Cyberverse
design, but less stylized. So, really, his G1 design. In vehicle mode Optimus
Prime's proportions are... questionable. The front cab section is really
"squashed" down, with the details on the upper half of it in particular
not being as tall as they should be. Also, the truck "bed" section in the
back is too tall, coming up a pretty fair amount above the tires for a
bed. It's also pretty obvious that the truck bed is just Optimus Prime's
lower legs, though to be fair, that's the case with nearly every Optimus
toy. At least this time the feet are up against the base of the front cab
portion, while the KNEES actually form the back end. There's no small segment
in between to connect the two legs, so this toy doesn't really have a back
end-- you just see an open gap in the middle and then the gaps on the top
of the knees back there. The mold detailing-- except for almost nothing
on the roof, oddly-- is surprisingly intricate, with "bolted" plates, pistons,
ladders, and side doors all molded into the toy where appropriate. There's
also windshield wipers below the windows and small headlights and smokestacks.
The wheels also have some decent treaded details on them. The basic color
breakup is pretty much what Optimus' colors have always been-- red on the
front and dark blue on the back, with some light gray and black here and
there. Nothing really ground-breaking. There's some black paint on the
knee and lower leg "treaded" details on the lower robot legs/back of this
mode, as well as some silver on the front grill, light blue on the front
windows, and some metallic bronzish-gold on the front bottom headlights
(the latter only on the 7" toy). Thus from a frontal view Optimus looks
okay in terms of having a varied color scheme, but from the side he really
needs some more paint to bring out all those details-- especially the side
windows.

     Transforming Optimus
to robot mode is pretty straightforward-- unfold the legs from the back
end, unhook the top of the front section and fold it back and down to rest
against his upper back, and then slide out and rotate around the front
sides to become his arms. It's a pretty basic, nice transformation scheme
fitting for the "Transformers 101" nature of this line. The end result
definitely has some oddities, however. For one, due to the transformation
the inside of Optimus' lower legs are completely hollow, making them look
very odd from an inside-side view. (He's still stable, though.) The upper
portion of the cab just sits on Optimus' back, which, though certainly
not an egregious extra, is a bit odd to have back there given how Optimus
usually transforms. His arms, being mostly formed out of the cab sides,
have the fists and the like mostly just molded into the insides of said
truck parts, with the halves of the front bumper sticking out in front
of the arms in a rather unsightly manner. The mold detailing remains pretty
decent in this mode, with some excellent faux bumper details on his waist,
faux grill on his chest sized in a way that it looks like "abs", and a
faux truck chest. His headsculpt is pretty classic Prime, though with the
side antennae a bit smaller and more rounded than they've traditionally
been. The lower arms are detailed pretty well too, with not just the fists
looking decent but smaller details like the typical "triangles" and armor
panels on his arms there, too. What's interesting to note is that, though
the light gray plastic shows more in this mode-- on the midsection, mostly--
it's actually a light, semi-metallic shade of light milky gray, with some
glitter mixed in to the point where it all almost looks like paint-- it's
quite a nice effect. Beyond that, there's some really nicely contrasting
light blue on his windows and eyes, gray on his faceplate and forehead
vent, some gold on the faux headlights on his waist, and some black outlining
the faux windows and even being present on the windshield wipers. (The
gold and black outlining of the windows is missing on the smaller version.)
For articulation, Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders, hips, and knees,
and on the larger version ONLY, he has elbow articulation. The elbow movement
is rather wonky, though, as even though they're ball joints, the way they're
facing he has to rotate the interior of his arms forward to move the actual
arms forward. Not really sure why they did that.

     Authentics Optimus Prime
has a pretty decent robot mode for the size and pricepoint, minus a few
really odd bits like the bumpers in front of his hands and completely hollow
lower legs. However, his vehicle mode has some really weird, squat proportions.
It's okay for someone looking for a basic, entry-level Optimus Prime toy--
which again, is what this line is aimed at-- but if you're not in that
specific category (and you're likely not if you're reading this), this
toy really isn't worth it. (I'd say this doubly so for the larger 7" version,
as all he gains out of it are a couple of extra paint apps and odd elbows
in exchange for almost twice the price.)
