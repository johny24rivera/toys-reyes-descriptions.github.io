    Megatron's alt mode is
the usual tank it's been for a while now, though compared to most of his
recent toys, the proportions here are a bit less realistic. The turret
is WAY too large in comparison to the tank, nearly being as large as the
body itself-- the cannon is also a bit too short and chunky, and there's
no real back end-- just Megatron's knees back there. The turret sadly can
also not rotate, though the cannon can move up and down. The biggest offender,
though, are the VERY obvious-- and quite large-- robot feet stuck on the
sides. The general design of this toy is based loosely off of G1 Megatron,
but the feet there were MUCH less obvious, albeit a bit small in robot
mode. I'm not sure why they made this Megs' feet so huge and obvious in
this mode. As for his colors, Megs is sporting his G1 color scheme of mostly
gray, black, a dark gray, and silver. The light milky gray plastic-- as
you'd expect me to say by now if you've been reading my reviews for a while--
is bland, and I wish much of it had the silver paint that's used on the
front of this mode. (The seemingly arbitary mismatch between the gray and
the silver in front is also a bit jarring.) The back end of the tank is
a darker gray, but a kind of brownish, almost gunmetal gray that actually
looks good-- almost semi-metallic. Much of the paint actually is inside
Megatron's treads, with all his wheels painted silver, though the treads
themselves are black plastic, along with the cannon. The paint along the
rest of this mode is fairly minimal, but I do like the nice purple "Energon"
line along the sides of the cannon barrel-- I wish the color was a bit
lighter for better contrast and used a bit more throughout the figure,
though. The mold detailing varies quite a bit, with the top portion of
the turret having very simplistic details-- nearly non-existent on the
back end-- but his treads are impressively well-detailed, as are the rear
dark gray parts, with vents, handlebars, and the like molded into the toy.

    Megatron's turret becomes
his arms, the back end becomes his legs, and the front becomes his chest--
he's got a pretty simple transformation, as you'd expect from a Cyber Battalion
toy. This mode is considerably better, and makes for a pretty solid "modern
update" for G1 Megatron. The proportions are roughly spot-on for Megatron,
the only exceptions being that the upper legs are a bit too thin. The mold
detailing on his head is pretty solid, though I'm not sure why his eyes
were painted purple when they've pretty much always been red (the silver
face on the dark gray-brown head looks quite nice, on the other hand).
The mold detailing on Megatron's few other newly visible parts in this
mode-- the hips and stomach-- are pretty average, though I do like the
linear "ab" details on said stomach. The color scheme in this mode is a
bit more clearly separated, with the legs and main body clearly being silver
paint, dark brown-gray, and a bit of black, with the arms being that unpainted
milky gray plastic. Megatron's cannon from tank mode can mount on either
of his forearms in this mode-- with three pegs on the cannon, you can also
stick it with the hollow end the cannon facing against the lower arm or
down at the floor (or, heck, up at the sky, if you're into that). Megatron
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, hips (at two points),
and knees. He could use lower arm or leg rotation, but for the Cyber Battalion
line he's already considerably above-average in this category. That said,
the ratchets in his hips are a little too strong-- I could sadly see the
teeth of the ratchets snapping off after a long period of play, with the
joints just becoming friction joints if that happens.

    I'm of two minds about
Cyber Battalion Megatron. In tank mode, he's a bit weak; his turret is
way too big, his cannon too short, he's got REALLY obvious honking feet,
and a lot of blah light milky gray plastic. On the other hand, he's got
one of the best robot modes from this subline-- well-proportioned, no kibble,
one of the best-articulated in the line, and just a solid modern update
of G1 Megatron. Normally I'd say my recommendation on this comes down to
how much you can overlook the vehicle mode for the great robot mode, but
this toy was never released in America like most of the other Cyber Battalion
toys, so he can be fairly expensive to get on the aftermarket. As such,
I'd only recommend him for big Megatron fans or completists.
