    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Skystalker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     Sunspot certainly lives
up to his name. The white on him is bleached, and pretty much exactly the
shade of sand you'd find on a tropical beach. The yellowish orange paint
apps add color contrast a fair amount with this white, and the sweeping
lines in vehicle mode really make those paint apps look like rays playing
off the surface. However, in vehicle mode there isn't really any significant
amount of a dark color to offset all the lighter colors-- and honestly,
this color scheme doesn't fit a stealth drone at all, which is probably
my biggest beef with it. In robot mode, gray/silver and dark rusty brown--
along with a tad of black-- help to break up all the light colors a bit
more, though only the brown seems to contrast and fit in with the color
scheme particularly well.

     Autobot Alliance Sunspot
certainly has a "sunny" color scheme, but his colors really don't fit his
alt mode at all, and his dark colors needed to be a bit more promiment
(particularly in vehicle mode) to contrast a bit more with all his light
colors. I'd definitely recommend RotF Skystalker's color scheme over this
one.

       Sunspot has memory problems. Mission
objectives, target data and the names of his allies slip from his mind
like sand through a sieve. He remembers how to fly most of the time, which
is lucky, because he finds a simple joy in being airborne. What's unlucky
is that he tends to forget the Autobots are constantly on the lookout for
Decepticons operating on their own, so he often wanders directly into a
surprise attack.
