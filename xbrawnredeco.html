    Mold History
   </b>
   : X-Brawn was a completely
new mold created for Car Robots (which subsequently became Robots in Disguise).

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe X-Brawn.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original deluxe

     X-Brawn's "super" upgraded
version certainly gets a major color change. Instead of being mostly silver
and green, he's now a veritable plethora of colors, albeit the major ones
are green, white, and gold. With all his colors, he's definitely eye candy
in both modes. And hey, he's got gold tires! Neato! (He's also got a gold,
rather than a silver, engine under his hood this time.) His colors are
definitely more suiting for a minivan participating in a race, rather than
your conventional minivan. He's even got "Wild 24" on his vehicle mode.
Although this may not make much sense for RiD, it actually does in the
Japanese series- "Wildride" was X-Brawn's Japanese name, and it was the
24th toy made in that line. I thought that was rather neat. The gold, white,
and seafoam green are a simply stunning combination in robot mode. I literally
just stare at his robot mode for minutes, it's THAT good-looking. His colors
may seem to clash on the show, but that's because they don't really put
a whole lot of depth perception into the animation on the show. The toy
looks much better, and the colors don't clash at all.

     No mold changes have
been made to this toy, so it retains all the flaws and features of its
predecessor in that respect.

     "Super" X-Brawn is a
very nice toy, and has a more attractive color scheme than the original
version, in my opinion. Highly recommended; be warned, however- some people
have reported seeing some sloppy paint jobs on a few X-Brawn redecos.

       X-Brawn is extremely tough and very
strong. He can withstand the harshest elements and muscle his way through
the worst situations. Lots of talking and speeches annoy him - he wants
to know just the facts, so that he can get out there and punch out some
Decepticon. HeÂ’s a martial arts master with a left arm that can do serious
damage to anyone in his path.
