    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated deluxe
Lockdown. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Blazing Lockdown is a
repaint more in the literal sense than most "repaints" in that most of
the base plastic colors-- namely, all the black parts and the transparent
light red windows-- are the same, while the paint applications have been
changed instead. The most noticeable change is that instead of green "skeletal"
paint apps, Blazing Lockdown has-- you guessed it-- fire paint apps. They're
not just fire paint apps, they're done using a very attractive shade of
metallic golden yellow. It all looks particularly good in robot mode, where
Blazing Lockdown particularly shines. The couple of flaming gold paint
apps visible in his vehicle mode look nice, but unfortunately there aren't
nearly enough of them-- in this mode Lockdown doesn't look so much "Blazing"
as he does "Slightly Hot". Some necessary paint apps are missing as well,
such as the complete lack of paint on the rear windows-- in fact, the couple
of flame paint apps and paint on the rear bumper are Lockdown's only paint
applications in vehicle mode, making it look way more bland than it should.
Lockdown also has some pale tan-gold plastic, which looks good as the secondary
color that it is. The metallic version of this color used in robot mode
also looks quite nice against the other colors, and helps to vary things
up a bit.

     Blazing Lockdown has
one mold change-- the hook arm attachment has been remolded into a chainsaw
attachment. The good side to this is that I think the chainsaw looks more
impressive than the hook, and looks pretty cool coming out of the front
of the vehicle mode. However, it can't fold away-- if you want it taken
off, you have to physically remove it from the figure and set it aside,
which kinda bites. Other than this, no mold changes have been made to Blazing
Lockdown-- he STILL has that annoying problem with his hands not unfolding
all the way in robot mode.

     Blazing Lockdown has
a nice color combo and some nice metallic paint apps, but the combination
of not having nearly enough paint apps in vehicle mode plus having a base
color that's the same as the previous release of this toy only makes it
worth getting to really big Lockdown fans. Otherwise get the original release
or

     of this mold instead.

       Exposed to an exotic form of energy,
Lockdown goes through remarkable changes. His systens are suddenly super
energized so much that the excess power leaks directly through his armor
in a fiery glow. Devoted more deeply than ever to tracking and destroying
his Autobot prey, he no longer demands payment for his work. Now, he hunts
simply for the joy of seeing the fear in a victim's eyes.
