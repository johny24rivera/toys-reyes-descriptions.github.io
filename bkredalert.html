    As a vehicle, this version
of Cybertron Red Alert is pretty passable-- though I don't recall the sides
of the "real"

    being blue,
but whatever. The paint details on the windows, sirens, and front of the
car are good enough, and the needed mold detailing is there, though not
much else besides that. No real obvious robot extras to speak of, so all
in all, for a Happy Meal toy I got no complaints with this mode.

    In robot mode, though
(as is common for the Happy Meal toys the past few years), the toy looks
absolutely ridiculous. The head is too tall proportionally when compared
to its width, and looks odd. The arms look serviceable, as does the chest,
but oh yeah, Red Alert has NO LEGS to speak of. Not even chinsy leg details
molded INTO the bottom chunk of plastic-- just nothing. Yeah, THAT looks
nice. Gotta wonder how ol' Red Alert's gonna get around now... Also, his
upper "legs" are practically nonexistent and far too small when compared
to his lower "legs". Another big downside is that there is NO paint detailing
at at all in this mode, and it's desperately needed on the head and chest.
The back end of the vehicel mode also hangs behind the main body as kibble,
but that's really a small downside compared to the two just mentioned.
He also really can't move much at all...

    Don't be fooled by Red
Alert's decent vehicle mode-- his robot mode blows chunks. Avoid at all
costs, even if you're a completist.
