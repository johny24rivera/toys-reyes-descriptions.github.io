    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the deluxe AoE Slash toy.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of deluxe AoE Slash

     Like the other non-Grimlock
Dinobot redecoes for the TLK line, Slash here still has a bit of color
to him, but it's definitely more subdued compared to his AoE release, which
was actually rather loud, looking almost as much like a tropical fern as
a velociraptor. The basic blue color on most of his body is still here,
but it's considerably paler and a bit lighter than the blue on his AoE
toy, almost like it was bleached a fair bit. The fern green has been replaced--
for better or worse-- with mostly a light milky gray plastic, particularly
on his bendy plastic parts. Unfortunately it's that same shade of very
dull, bland milky gray, so I consider it a negative, even it is more "realistic"
for a robotic velociraptor. The silver paint used on the top of his dino
head, his neck spikes, his feet, and the claws on his dino hands-- as well
as on the mouth visor of his robot head-- looks marvelous, though, and
contrasts quite well with the blue to form a color scheme that's "cooler"
in tone than his AoE version. A bit of metallic light silvery blue paint
is also used to help "bridge the gap" between the two colors, on his robot
helmet and chest, as well as on his dino upper legs/robot upper arms, the
tip of his tail, and the underside of his dino neck. A few other colors
are used here and there, such as a nice shade of dark greenish blue on
his dino legs/robot arms and some connector pieces-- another excellent
contrast color. There's also some black plastic used on the robot shoulders
and some small connector pieces, but it's of that charcoal-y look, when
I feel a more "pure" black would've looked better. Finally, there's a bit
of red on the eyes (or visor) of both modes.

     No mold changes have
been made to TLK Slash when compared to his AoE deluxe toy.

     TLK Slash was a really
weird choice for Wave 1 of the movie line-- he wasn't in this movie OR
the last one, and thus putting a repaint of him in the first wave definitely
helped Wave 1 clog shelves more than it already was. The re-use of so many
Dinobot toys in the TLK line when they barely appeared in the actual movie
was a mistake, too, and given how many characters were in the movie that
DIDN'T get a slot, it honestly makes Slash kind of a waste of a slot in
the line. Still, taken by himself, if you liked the Slash design but thought
it was too colorful the first time around, here you go. He's got a fair
number of paint apps that contast excellently with each other-- the blues
and silver go together very well-- but the overall duller colors and especially
the usage of light milky gray plastic for the soft plastic make him a step
below the original, in my opinion.
