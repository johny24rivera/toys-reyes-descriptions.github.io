    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM Commander
class Sentinel Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Sentinel Prime's "Dark"
redeco fits his name slightly, but it's not a traditional "dark" (read:
black and purple or teal) color scheme for a heroic Transformer character,
but rather looks a bit like the original toy under dull lighting and with
more gray. Yes, that last part is what gets me about Dark Sentinel Prime;
out of all the colors to add to him, they decided to make
     <i>
      gray
     </i>
     a
major color for him? The movie line's got way too much of that milky gray
already, it definitely doesn't need any more, and it looks quite boring,
besides. Most of his black parts (the wheels and front "windows") are the
same as on this mold's original version, with the other real difference
(and it isn't that big of one) being that his red plastic is darker and
duller, with a slight maroon/fuchsia tint to it. This fits in terms of
making him slightly more like the faction he (more or less) turns to in
the movie, as do a couple other telling paint apps such as his scratched-out
Autobot symbols on the sides of his vehicle mode and eeevil red paint now
being used for his robot eyes. There's also a few metallic fuchsia paint
apps (mostly visible in robot mode) that look really good and add a bit
more to the color scheme, complementing the dull red nicely-- I wish it
was used more. A bit of metallic gunmetal gray rounds out Dark Sentinel's
color scheme, which looks nice coating his melee weapon, but sticks out
REALLY obviously against the light gray when used on only parts of the
sides of his vehicle mode like it is.

     Dark Sentinel Prime
has a few neat bits to him-- namely the metallic fuchsia, red eyes, and
scratched-out Autobot symbols which fit the "theme" of this redeco-- but
largely he's an entirely unneeded toy. He takes the already widely-available
first version of this mold, gives it more gray and a couple of other relatively
minor color alterations, and releases it again. Unless you're a big Sentinel
Prime fan, this one's an easy pass in favor of the first version of this
mold. (All that said, I am a big fan of how his bio's worded-- making you
assume he's still a heroic character unless you've watched the movie and
can fill in the purposefully ambiguous blank.

       Sentinel Prime was one of the most heralded
