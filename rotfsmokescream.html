not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Universe 2.0 Legends
class Rodimus toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

       Unlike the
       <a href="rotfsmokescreen.html">
        mainline
release
       </a>
       of Smokescreen, this version is a bit more obvious of an homage
to his
       <a href="g1smokescreen.html">
        G1 version
       </a>
       , complete with a red
roof, blue sides, and the number "38" decal on the car doors. Like on the
original Smokescreen, this works fairly well as a color scheme, and is
certainly more bright and colorful than most of the Movie toys-- only the
black, which is a secondary color, is dark. That said, the absence of a
white stripe between the blue and red in vehicle mode takes away a little
something from the overall scheme, though I understand this decision could've
been made because of the tiny size of the toy. Smokescreen also could really
use a few more varied paint apps in robot mode-- even though a fair amount
of paint is used to make parts of him blue, besides the face there really
isn't any detailing to accentuate his mold detailing. The main problem
I have with this paint job, though, is that it simply doesn't feel right
on the Rodimus mold. Many repaint homages make sense-- but other than this
one being a sportscar in vehicle mode, this mold doesn't work that well
as Smokescreen. And, given how relatively mainly repaint homages Smokescreen
has gotten in the past couple of years, it seems a bit superfluous on top
of that.

           in that the same familiar teal-ish tattoos are on a darker jet
mode. The tattoos on this version are less "minty" and more blue, however,
which I think goes with this Starscream's black plastic quite well-- it's
quite a nice shade of teal, and I wish some more of the tattoos were visible
on Starscream's robot mode. The silver paint also goes well with the black,
but honestly my favorite part of the color scheme are the bits of dark
blue-- that color's only on the jet cockpit and Decepticon symbol, but
it looks REALLY good against the black for some reason. It's another dark
color, so you don't think it would, but surprisingly it just looks
           <i>
            right
           </i>
           for
a reason I can't quite put my finger on. I wish a bit more of the blue
had been used, perhaps in place of the silver. Regardless, it's still an
excellent color scheme that catches the eye easily.

             This set is probably
one that even most collector-oriented Transformers fans can pass up-- you've
got a decent mold with an ill-fitting homage paint job (Smokescreen) and
an awful mold with a good paint job (Starscream) here. Neither particularly
scream "BUY ME NOW!", since you aren't getting any overall discount from
buying them both in the same package. If you're a particularly huge Legends
class fan, this set may be worth a look; otherwise, it's a pretty easy
pass.

               Starscream feels pretty good about this
one. Smokescreen might be one of the most famous Autobots for his abilities
as a tactician, but he can't fly, and the Decepticon air warrior thinks
that gives him an advantage. Unfortunately for Starscream, he's about to
find out exactly why Smokescreen is so famous.
