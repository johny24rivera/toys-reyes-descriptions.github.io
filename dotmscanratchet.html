    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the deluxe version of Revenge
of the Fallen Ratchet. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Like the other toys in
the Toys "R" Us exclusive "Scan Series", this line's version of Ratchet
possess the same general colors of his movie/original color scheme, but
changes it up in vehicle mode by applying a "Trans-Scan" pattern, with
the front part looking normal, the middle being covered with transparent
blue plastic and light blue &amp; white lines, and the back end being mostly
made of unpainted clear plastic to simulate the vehicle being "scanned"
by a Transformer, like what happened in the first live action TF movie.
Ratchet's "scanning" pattern looks particularly cool, as beyond the transparent
blue in the middle and the light blue "tech" lines, there's also Ratchet's
signature "heartbeat" line design on his sides outlined in light blue as
it's "applied" to his reformatting. This just looks all sorts of nifty.
It's also particularly impressive just how many different colors of paint
apps this version has; in addition to the colors you'd expect from a movie
Ratchet toy and clear plastic at the back end, he's got a few bits of gray
that are actually slightly purplish in color; a couple different shades
of blue; a really nice metallic gunmetal gray on his robot face and his
upper legs; and some white on said upper legs. The way his door emblems
fade away into the "trans-scanning" part of the vehicle is EXTREMELY well-done,
too. In robot mode, this "trans-scanning" look still goes quite well with
his plastic layout, with the top part being his normal colors, some of
the middle having his transparent blue "trans-scanning" plastic and paint
apps, as well as a bit of transparent green on his lower arms to help with
this "formatting" effect, and his legs are mostly clear plastic. However,
as cool as all of this is, a word of caution; ALL of Ratchet's green is
painted on clear plastic, and being a slightly metallic shade, it's a tad
on the rough side. None of the green paint on mine has rubbed off after
a few years, but if it ever does it'll be really noticeable.

     No mold changes have

     Scan Series Ratchet
continues
the Toys "R" Us exclusive subline's trend of applying an extremely cool
"trans-scanning" effect to the toy, with approximately a third being the
toy's normal colors, a third an awesome combination of transparent and
light blue "scanning" paint apps, and the last third being mostly clear
plastic. The way everything comes together looks stunning in both modes,
and is definitely my favorite of this mold's various color schemes. (That
said, I wish this was made from the superior

     and not the medicore RotF deluxe mold.)

       If possible, Autobot Ratchet prefers
to scan an alternate mode that will assist him in his duties as a medic.
Anything that can move local traffic out of his way and possibly provide
new tools to use in repairing fallen Autobots will serve. Heavy armor and
a powerful engine are just an added bonus.
