    It's another year, so
another 1-step changer mold for Optimus Prime for RID2015! Compared to
the

    ,
this one's alternate mode is a little more curvy and rounded at the edges.
There's still definitely several simple angular molded-in details on the
trailer in particular that look like large, overlapping pieces of metal,
but the actual edges are pretty rounded. This version also definitely has
the least mold detailing in vehicle mode out of the three various 1-step
versions of this design; it's all VERY basic in this mode except for the
cab section, which oddly seems kind of "encased" in the back by portions
of the trailer, with the blue going all the way to the front wheels on
the bottom and the rear red sections-- which are his robot shoulders--
not looking much like the rear portion of the cab, and are pretty undetailed.
The cab sections themselves are pretty nicely detailed, though, with smokestacks,
stylized side doors, the edgy grill, the "bolts" on the front of the roof,
and the like. Unfortunately, due to the transformation, there's a big line
down the center of the cab that doesn't peg together in this mode. However,
due to the intended audience of these 1-step figures, I don't have as big
a problem with this as I would if it were aimed at older audiences. Beyond
the milky red on the cab and the somewhat dark glittery blue plastic used
for the trailer-- which looks really nice 'n sparkly, by the by-- there's
also a bit of black in this mode. Obviously it's used for the tires, but
there's also some minor connector pieces that use it as well, such as some
pieces under the middle of the trailer and above the middle-to-rear portion
of the trailer. (The latter has a port on the top for you to plug something
like a Mini-Con Weaponizer or something in it.) Due to the transformation,
there's a pretty big, noticeable gap in between the sides of the trailer.
The black piece I just mentioned help covers up this gap a LITTLE, but
it's still pretty obvious and definitely the biggest eyesore with this
mode-- such a huge visible gap just looks bad. For paint, there's some
black on the front truck windows and silver on his grill, but that's it.

    To transform this version
of Optimus, basically his whole front section folds up and back, with the
rest of the toy auto-transforming as a result. The end result is... ehhh.
The biggest problem is that the blue trailer section is very much a rectangle
in this mode that makes up almost the entirety of Optimus' main body and
legs. From a front view, you can see his "skirt" and legs molded into a
piece in front of this blue trailer rectangle, which continues up behind
his main body and even behind his head a bit. There's also that aforemetioned
black piece with the port in it behind his head, and especially if you're
to look at Optimus from any view other than a front view in this mode,
it's a pretty huge, distracting piece of truck hanging off of him. The
headsculpt itself is pretty nice, even if it's molded onto the underside
of a piece that flips down in vehicle mode, meaning there's some plastic
behind and between his antennae. (It's also sunk down a little from the
top of the chest, making it look like he's struggling to peer over his
own pecs.) From the side, there's also two significant gaps in the main
body of Optimus-- behind his upper legs, and a smaller gap behind his feet.
His cab portion splits to form his chest and his arms, giving him a rather
flat chest with rather unconvincing mold detailing and misshappen faux
black windows. His shoulders are nice, but the rest of his arms are merely
molded onto the insides of his truck cab halves, which looks rather weird
and definitely too bulky. There's also no pegs or anything connecting his
shoulders to his body-- just springs, so if you lean Optimus forward in
this mode, his entire shoulders and arms slouch forward because of gravity
and all. At least his small upper arms are painted silver to help break
up the colors there, though, along with some silver on his upper legs,
face, forehead vent, and a bit of light blue on his eyes. The red, black,
and blue plastic are also broken up a bit more for a slightly more interesting
color scheme than his vehicle mode. For articulation, Optimus can move
his arms forward and out to the sides at the shoulders, but that's it.
His fists DO have holes in them sized for holding weapons, but his arms
can't point completely straight due to their molding, so he can't point
weapons directly forward, sadly.

    I would rather Hasbro
have spent their efforts on a 1-step for a new character (at least for
the size class), as everything this 1-step RID2015 Optimus tries to do,
another version has done better. The original Target exclusive version
had a better color scheme and superior robot mode, while the 2016 mass-release
1-step mold had the best vehicle mode. This toy has a couple of interesting
things going on with the transformation, but it's definitely one of the
weaker 1-step molds. Only recommended for Optimus completists.
