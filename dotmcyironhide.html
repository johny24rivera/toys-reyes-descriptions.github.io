    Ironhide's alt mode is,
as you likely know by now, a GMC Topkick pickup truck. It's recreated very
faithfully even at this small scale, with the proportions spot-on as well
as the mold detailing. There's a little bit of "robot bits" sticking out
of the center bottom of the vehicle, but it's not a huge deal-- heck, if
it was colored black like most of the rest of the toy, it would almost
be unnoticeable. There's also a small gap in between the two halves of
the front hood due to the transformation, but this is barely noticeable,
either. My main beef with ol' cow-head in this mode is that he has almost
no paint detailing at all. Granted, he is a black truck, but still-- something
on the windows, the rear bumper, the wheel rims, SOMETHING beyond simply
his smokestacks and a strip along his front bumper being painted silver.
Movie Ironhide's never had a particularly interesting (movie-accurate)
color scheme, but this pushes even how single-color HE is. As far as weapons
go, Ironhide has a pretty cool one for a Cyberverse toy. His two hand cannons
from robot mode here combine to form a really long, "super cannon" which
can be clipped near the rear of his truck mode on a standard C-clip mount
(pictured above), which means that if you have other C-clip weapons he
can mount those there, too. The long pegs do prevent Ironhide's long cannon
from being aimed as well as one would think, but via those pegs his cannon
can also be mounted on the roof, to the right of center-- or, alternatively,
you can split up his cannons and mount them on each of the peg holes in
his side doors (which is the recommended, movie-accurate configuration
for robot mode).

    Ironhide's robot mode
is fairly accurate for this scale, and proportion-wise he's pretty good,
minus the arms which are too short and tiny. Ironhide in particular needs
some beefy arms. His shoulders are also located a bit too far back due
to the transformation, and his most obvious vehicle kibble is on said arms
(composed of two halves of his side doors, with one half on the upper and
one half on the lower part of each arm). The top of his vehicle mode also
simply is on his back, though it stays in place and gets in the way of
movement little, if at all. His chest replicates his caved-in hood look
pretty accurately, and his legs for the most part are nice and proportional
as well with big, large feet to make him stable. (His upper legs are a
tad short, but that's a small quibble.) Ironhide gets a bit more diverse
as far as colors go in this mode with two different shades of light gray
entering the mix, but he's exceptionally boring and still needs more paint
apps (though at least his lower legs have a fair amount of silver on them).
This is made a bit more unfortunate by how extraordinarily fine (and accurate)
his mold detailing is-- on all this light gray and black plastic, it's
easy to miss. His head is particularly well-sculpted. His articulation
is pretty good-- he can move at the shoulders, elbows (at two points),
hips, knees, and ankles, and many of those are on ball joints. His upper
arms are the only place where articulation is particularly restrictive.
One last note-- in addition to being mounted on the back sides of his arms,
Ironhide can also carry his cannon weapon(s) in his hands in this mode,
though personally I think it looks way cooler to leave them mounted on
the arms like in the movies.

    Cyberverse Ironhide
is a pretty decent replica of the design-- certainly far better of a try
than he's had up to this point at this small scale, at any case, and he
has some mighty nifty weapons. That said, his arms in robot mode are still
really weak-looking and kibbly, and he desperately needs more paint detailing.
Mildly recommended.

      The only thing Ironhide loves more than
two big guns is one even bigger gun. His entire life has been devoted to
the study of weaponry. The louder the bang it makes, the more he likes
it. Peace is his ultimate goal, of course, but he believes lasting peace
can only be achieved through force of arms.
