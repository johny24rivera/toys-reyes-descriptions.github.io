    Odd that the "Blizzard
Strike" version of this mold is released before Drift's regular colors--
wonder what the logic was behind that! Regardless, in vehicle mode, this
version of Drift has a largely spot-on car mode. Proportionally everything
is pretty much exactly like the show model. There's no robot mode extras
whatsoever, nor any really obnoxious gaps because of the transformation
3-step gimmick. The mold detailing is very much what you'd expect from
Drift-- that is, a pretty sleek sportscar mode, with only minimal detailing
like the windows for the most part. What IS surprising is that there's
even a wide exhaust vent detailed in the back that sticks out below the
back end of the car (this becomes the heels in robot mode). As you'd expect
for Drift, the front grill contains most of the mold detailing-- there's
armor-like lines on the side, nice angular headlights and vent details,
and of course Drift's signature head crest on the front of the grill. As
for the color scheme, every "Blizzard Strike" version of Drift interestingly
enough has a different color scheme, and this version of Blizzard-y Drift
is the lightest in color overall. A main color is white, but a pale, slightly
bluish white that is PERFECT for the arctic-- like the color of a bunch
of ice. The main contrast color against this white is a dark blue-- either
semi-metallic if it's plastic (it has some glitter mixed in) or outright
metallic if it's paint. You'd think using two slightly different shades
of blue right next to each other would look bad/be obvious-- like the paint
on the rear third of this mode right up against the plastic on the center
hood-- but this isn't the case. They generally tend to seamlessly go together
unless you REALLY look carefully. Regardless, it's a pretty good basic
color scheme, as the dark/light scheme provides a good amount of contrast
while both colors are still arctic-y. That said, the white paint apps on
the doors aren't QUITE solid enough to block out the dark blue behind them,
so the dark blue plastic "bleeds through" the white paint there and dulls
the white slightly-- THAT'S actually more noticeable than the two different
shades of dark blue, believe it or not. I love love LOVE the angular blue
and white detailing that largely separates the blue and white in this mode--
sort of like a stylized version of "snow splattered" on the car mode. There's
also a nice shade of moderately light blue used on the headlights, which
looks pretty nice and I wish was used more on the toy. There's some charcoal
black on the tires (of course), as well as some flat black paint on the
windows (including the rear window, huzzah!).

    <a href="rid23stepbee.html">

    ,
but you push out and twist the back end instead of the front end-- otherwise
all the motions are the same. It's a fun, effective transformation that
accomplishes a lot, and keeps the robot mode surprisingly accurate despite
the simplistic transformation. The only parts that are really off-model
are the lower legs, which are merely the back thirds of the vehicle mode.
Proportionally they fit in well with the overall mode so that's a small
downside, but it is worth noting. There's also the hood sticking out slightly
behind the body detailing, but that's a reeallly minor problem, especially
for a 3-step toy. The front sections of the car split out to become Drift's
wide, armored shoulders, while his lower arms have the car doors molded
on the outside of them, but are still 3-D enough where I don't really mind
this. The molding on the chest details is all there and accurate, with
some basic curvy details on the chest and a segmented armor "skirt" and
buckle on the waist. His headsculpt is spot-on, with his two thin black
forehead antennae and a long face, which on this version is covered up
by a silver segmented armor battle mask. There's also some of that nice
light metallic blue on the eyes. Overall the color scheme in this mode
is a bit darker than in vehicle mode, with more dark blue and charcoal
black visible and less off-white. That said, there's still plenty of all
three colors-- he's still got those excellent stylized "snow splatters"
on his shoulders and waist armor, and some more of that white on the chest.
For some reason there's also one spot of gunmetal gray in the middle of
the chest-- it's kinda random, but it's a darn good color, so I ain't complaining.
For articulation, Drift can only move forward at the shoulders-- thus his
articulation is pretty limited, though then again articulation isn't the
focus of these simplistic changers.

    Drift is a very solid
3-step changer, using Bumblebee's "pull out, twist, and push back in" transformation
gimmick in an even more effective manner, and looks very solid in both
modes with no obnoxious extras-- he actually has better proportions than
the
    <a href="rid2drift.html">

    ! The inaccurate feet
are the only real downside of this simplistic transformation, which is
quite surprising (in a good way, of course). Yes, he's also got very little
articulation, but so does ever other toy in this subline. The Blizzard
Strike color scheme-- especially the stylized "snow splatter" paint apps
everywhere-- looks pretty nice, as well. Highly recommended if you're not
a big articulation stickler-- my favorite 3-step changer mold out of the
entire line, it's easy to see this being a fave of kids.
