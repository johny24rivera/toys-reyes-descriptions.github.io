    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Color-wise, this Optimus
isn't different from the original 3-step. He's still got a dark, semi-metallic
blue for most of the trailer/lower legs, and an even slightly darker, duller
metallic blue paint used for his head. His red plastic may be just a SHADE
lighter, but it's still that milky, semi-metallic shade, and is used for
the truck cab and the upper rear portion of the trailer, which makes it
his body and shoulders in robot mode. The difference here is that there's
a bit more red on the upper body this time, with the lower arms actually
only painted blue on the front-- no blue for the entire lower hands and
arms. The moderately light gray is used on the exact same spots on this
toy as on the original-- on the extendo-upper legs, and on some minor connector
pieces not readily visible in either mode. The black is a bit more prevalent--
beyond just being on the wheels and cab windows, it's also painted on Optimus'
crotch, knees, and feet, which helps break up the colors in robot mode
slightly more on this version. There is a titch of silver on the middle
of his arms, on his head, on a small portion of his grill (but not nearly
as much as on the original) and on his smokestacks. Unfortunately some
of the light blue details from the original are gone from the trailer and
shoulders, but they're still used on Optimus' eyes and on his new weapons.

     Speaking of his new
weapons, they're the major mold change made to this version-- large add-on
weapon pieces have been added to the sides of the robot arms/top of the
vehicle trailer, mimicking what happens to his Activator toy but without
actually needing an Activator to have them pop up (indeed, they're permanently
"deployed" on this toy). They're two large guns, though unfortunately a
major caveat with them is the pieces that connect them to the main body
only hold onto the guns with two tiny pegs. Given that Optimus can't hold
either gun in his hands, the guns can't be used elsewhere on the toy, so
there's no need to ever remove them. They pop off ALL THE TIME, so I'd
recommend taking a bit of glue there to keep those suckers where they're
supposed to be. Rather annoying they aren't connected more securely...
Each gun has a port on the top of it for you to pop on a Mini-Con Weaponizer
or another weapon with a similarly-sized peg. Additionally, to make up
for all this additional plastic on the top, the truck cab has been "sucked
dry" a bit. It's been remolded too, but it still has the same general "look"
as the truck cab on the original toy-- just a lot hollower and chinsier
look. The side portions above the wheels have been really shortened; the
front grill is smaller; the front hood has some more detailing that fits
his robot mode chest better than cab mode; the window details are skinnier
overall; and there's a substantial gap on the rear sides of the cab that
honestly look a bit ugly. Of course, this was done to keep Optimus still
roughly the same plastic mass given you're adding on two big guns, but
the original trailer looked far more solid. In one more cost-cutting measure,
the middle wheel on each side has been removed and instead replaced with
just the bottom half of a wheel detailed on the bottom side of the trailer
and painted black-- so yep, he's got two fake wheels on this version. He
still rolls just fine, though.

     THe 2017 mold of 3-step
Optimus is still a pretty decent simplified toy, and I do love the addition
of weaponry with some cool circuitry detailing on it. However, for just
about every plus of this toy, there's a minus on it-- that is, the far
less impressive cab; the removal of two wheels and some minor paint apps;
and the fact that the guns come off at the drop of a hat without glue.
I still like this version SLIGHTLY more than the original because I do
really like that additional weaponry, but it's close.
