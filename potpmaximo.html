    Like many of the other
Prime Masters, Liege Maximo has a very generic robot mode that doesn't
really look anything like he's been pictured as in the past. No "Loki-Bot"
here, sadly. He's got fairly normal robotic fists molded into his arms,
slightly skinny rectnagular legs molded into his... well... leg piece,
and a couple of vent details on his chest. His head has small side antennae,
with a rectangular bump on his forehead and a "normal" face. The only thing
that really sets Liege Maximo apart here is his color scheme, which is
gray on the legs, body, and on his helmet, with fuchsia on his arms, upper
legs, and face. No other colors are visible in this mode, so it's a very
two-tone color scheme, although the rather unique usage of fuchsia on a
Prime Master does make him stand out a bit more. Like with all Prime Masters,
in this mode Liege Maximo can move at the neck, as well as back-and-forth
at the shoulders, hips, and knees (the latter two as one for both legs,
since the legs are molded together). In Maximo's "core" mode, he's got
a rather unique, evil design, made up of several angular forest green shapes
that look a bit like an evil face with fangs and a large nose. I'm not
sure if that was the intent, but that's what I see it as. The rest of the
core mode (except for the gray legs on the back, which stick out a tad)
is fuchsia, with rather ornamental detailing around the symbol. There's
feathered-like details near the top, with some claw-like marks above the
center. There's also some angular details down the sides and coming in
on the bottom "chin" area, making this look even more like a face. This
is one of the easiest Prime Masters to use in place of a Titan Master on
a Titans Return toy, since it's easily see-able as an evil head.

    Like the other Prime
Master sets, Liege Maximo comes with a Pretender shell homage from G1 that
he can fit in. For this guy, it's a shell calling back to the Pretender
monster Skullgrin. He's a pretty fearsome medieval-style monster, with
a fanged, horned skull like some kind of bull-demon. As if that wasn't
enough, he's got a skeleton "belt buckle" as well. He has angular, medieval
armor covering his muscular chest, abs, and waist, with some angular kneecaps
and hoof-like feet. There's also some angular bits on the arms, as well--
it's all very well-detailed, at least when it comes to the mold. He's got
a nice amount of bone-white paint on the head and waist to fit with the
gray plastic on most of his body and fuchsia on his arms, abs and upper
legs. As for his weapon, it's a three-pronged claw that Skullgrin can hold
in either of his fists (it looks very oversized this way) or it can be
stored on his upper back. The rest of Skullgrin is pretty typical for a
Prime Master's Pretender shell-- from a side view it's not as impressive,
as it's a bit too bulky and is completely unpainted on the back end, just
being gray with some basic robotic details. He can move back-and-forth
at the shoulders, but that's it-- no other articulation in this mode. Skullgrin
has a weapon mode, which he transforms into in just the same manner as
all other Prime Master Pretender shells-- lay the toy down on its stomach,
flip the weapon on his back forward, rotate the peg in between his legs
down to become the handle larger TFs can hold him by, and then if you desire
plug in Liege Maximo (or another Prime Master) in core mode on the top
to "power up" the weapon. As is also typical with Prime Masters, this mode
is very weak, as the entirety of the front of the Pretender mode just hangs
there off the bottom, and the arms also don't go anywhere. The three-pronged
claw weapon does look pretty wicked with some silver paint detailing, but
ultimately it's too short compared to the main body of this weapon mode.
I'd recommend just ignoring the weapon modes for these toys for the most
part, honestly.

    Liege Maximo/Skullgrin
has a fairly interesting color scheme, as well as a pretty unique symbol
on his core mode that looks like a face and thus could more easily be used
with Titans Return toys than most other Prime Masters. Skullgrin has some
nice detailing, though the claw weapon mode looks weak even for a Prime
Master set weapon mode because of how proportionally small the claw is.
Still, out of the first wave of Prime Masters he's the most unique and
my favorite.
