    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM Legion
class Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM Legion class Starscream [with his Orbital Assault Carrier]

     This solo release of
the updated Cyberverse Starscream mold gives him a color scheme that's
noticeably different-- but not completely dissimilar to-- his "normal"
one. The tannish shade that's on most of his toys is definitely a shade
of gray here, albeit one that has an ever-so-slight brownish tint to it.
It's admittedly a quite dull color, though not having the "milky" bits
in it like so much other gray plastic in modern TFs makes it look more
fitting for a jet. He has some green camo spots on his jet mode, which
are pretty basic but help to add a bit more visual interest here and give
him at least a little bit of color. He's got some white trim in vehicle
mode too, which looks pretty nice as well, even if it's a bit too close
to the gray for my liking. This same white is used on his wing/chest in
robot mode for some of his signature "Cyberglyph" markings, with some of
them being a not-too-subtle portion of a large Decepticon symbol. My favorite
color on this toy, though, is definitely the dark blue used on Starscream's
shoulders-- it looks quite good against the gray, and it's a pity it's
only used there-- it really would've looked good on some other robot parts.
Finally, his eyes are painted dull gold, though they're so tiny the paint
apps are hard to make out from many angles.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Starscream.

     This solo release of
the Legion Starscream mold has a few unique things about it-- namely the
military camo in vehicle mode and the white "Cyberglyph" markings in robot
mode-- but it's not different enough overall from the initial release of
this mold for me to recommend it for someone who bought the previous version
(it's also a fairly boring color scheme, anyways). However, if you want
something that's a bit closer color-wise to how he looked in the first
movie-- or simply don't want the Orbital Assault Carrier vehicle his initial
release came with-- than this is the version for you.
