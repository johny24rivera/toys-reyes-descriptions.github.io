    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 warrior
version of Windblade. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original version of RID2015 warrior Windblade

     The warrior version of
Windblade got a re-release for Combiner Force, but unlike some other "older"
figures re-packaged in Combiner Force packaging, she received a deco change
and a bit of a remold, as well. Her general base colors are the same as
on her initial toy-- red and black-- and they're used on the same pieces.
The red is a couple of shades darker than the original's cherry red, this
one having a more straightforward medium red shade of the color. The paint
apps have been completely changed, however. For one, there's some yellow
in her robot mode, on the sides of her chest as well as on her kneecaps.
The charcoal black paint has been removed, and in its place is a lot more
black paint in her vehicle mode-- it's now covering the top of much of
her nosecone (except for the blue on her cockpit windows), and there's
some pretty cool black paint apps covering much of the middle of her wings.
Silver is also much more prevalent on this version, being mostly used in
long stripes on the back end of her wings (on both sides)-- this gives
a bit more emphasis to the "blade" part of her name. There's also some
silver on the middle of her lower legs and on the sides of her abs, with
a large light sky blue paint app in the middle of her stomach. (It should
be noted the blue used in her robot mode is considerably lighter than the
blue used on her cockpit windows in vehicle mode.) Finally, there's a bit
of red paint on the outward sides of her lower legs.

     Windblade has a new
headsculpt for this version, and it's her with her battle mask up. And
I have to say, it's a DARNED COOL look. Her battle mask covers her lower
face with a ninja-like decoration, and it being painted black against the
white of her face, the blue on her eyes, and the yellow diamond-like bit
in the middle of her forehead is an awesome variation. She also has her
"hair" painted black and her detachable headfan accessory painted a light
sky blue, same as her eyes.

     The Combiner Force redeco
of Windblade takes the original and improves it about as much as you could
while still keeping the base plastic colors (mostly) the same. The addition
of all the black and the silver stripes on her wings in vehicle mode really
helps make it more visually interesting, and the yellow and light blue
in robot mode really pops. A stellar and well-painted "battlemask" headsculpt
helps
to top it all off. Although the paint deco on the original is a little
more accurate to the show, this one is just considerably more interesting
altogether, and still not so much of a departure where I'd consider it
NOT generally accurate to the show. Recommended over the original warrior,
easily.
