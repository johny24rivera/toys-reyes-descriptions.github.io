    BAM! KA-ZOWIE! The most
well-known Autobot tank finally gets a "do-over" as a Legends figure. Unlike
pretty much every other Universe 2.0 Legends figure, though, Warpath's
vehicle mode is rather weak. It's definitely recognizable as a tank, what
the turret, the intricate mold detailing with armor plating, rivets, tread-wheels,
and all that molded in very well into the core figure. The color scheme
is also classic Warpath-- the red, light gray, and black go together well,
though I wouldn't exactly call it a particuarly eye-catching or original
color layout. (There's large areas of the vehicle mode that are completely
unpainted red plastic, and given all the mold detailing, that's a bit of
a shame.) The vehicle mode itself, is pretty lame. There's a wide-open
space at the front of the tank, while the BACK part is solid and actually
has less mass than the front end. Because of this, it makes one wonder
if the turret is actually pointed in the wrong direction-- why such a big
visible gap in the front, and not in the back (granted, I'd rather not
have a gap in vehicle mode AT ALL, but if you're gonna do it do in a place
that isn't as visible and central to the overall look of the mode). This
could be solved by simply rotating the turret around, but it can't-- it's
stuck in place, unfortunately. The "nozzle" can move up and down, but that's
it. The robot fists are also quite visible on the front of the mode, though
otherwise no real robot mode extras can be seen in this mode.

    Warpath's robot mode,
on the other hand, is DEFINITELY what the designers focused on. His proportions
are pretty much prefect-- he's got beefy upper arms and an appropriately-sized
chest and legs, and nothing looks too much like it's just "molded onto
the inside" of vehicle mode parts, as is the case with most other Legends
figures. I particularly like how, during the transformation, his head flips
up to make room for the turret's "nozzle" to retract into the chest, thus
giving Warpath the classic G1 look of having his cannon coming out of his
chest without having it stick out ludicrously far. His headsculpt is dead-on
G1 accurate, though his paint apps are, again, unimpressive-- he really
could use some more paint on his head, waist, and the front of his legs,
in particular. Warpath's articulation is about what you'd expect from a
Legends figure-- he can move at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees,
with the the shoulders and hips on ball joints. Hardly impressive, but
not bad, either. However, it should be noted that the knees have limited
movement because of the vehicle parts flipped behind the lower legs-- however,
I prefer this compared to having those vehicle parts folded out next to
his lower legs, thus making his lower legs look overly bulky and making
him less stable to boot.

    Universe 2.0 Warpath
is an excellent figure in robot mode and a great homage to the G1 character,
but his tank mode falls short in several areas-- the unsightly gap in the
front, the immovable turret, the lack of enough paint apps, and the "backwards"
look of the mode, to be specific. You can certainly do far worse when it
comes to Legends, but he's one of the "Minibots redux" that I'd recommend
the least.
