   : Originally planned
for release in the
   <a href="bmbfts.html">
    Beast Machines: Battle for the

   line, Megatron Megabolt was cancelled at the last minute. Luckily,
the mold was finally released a year later to fill out the end of the Robots
in Disguise line.

    Megabolt's alt mode is
a...giant....robotic...head...on insect legs. A very unique mode, to say
the least. One cannot help but notice that the head is nearly identical
in its design to the "giant floating head" that was Megatron in Season
2 of Beast Machines. Obviously, this was its intent- the insect legs were
added on for gimmickry, I suppose, as there's not much you can do with
just a giant head for a toy. For RiD, its backstory was altered a bit-
now Megabolt is a new form of RiD Megatron's, designed to combine with
Fortress Maximus to take it over. It actually fits on the Fort Max toy,
too, if you take out the spider legs, so that's a pretty neat touch. Anyway,
Megatron's "gimmick" in this mode is two-fold- by pushing the toy forward
on a flat surface, his mouth will move up and down, and the spider legs
will move in a slight circular motion, ala "crawling action". Other than
that, and pressing the button on top of Megabolt's head to fire his mouth-missile,
there's really not much you can do with that mode. But that's okay, really-
the extremely cool look of this mode more than makes up for it. One of
my favorite alt modes, ever. One of the downsides is that Megabolt's robot
"helmet" does stick out a little on the bottom, though, and the robot hand-panels
don't stay in their designated holes in the rear area very well.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    In robot mode, Megabolt
still looks very cool, and the "insect-leg backpack" on his back actually
complements the mode, rather than just looking like extra "kibble", like
his rather huge face-shoulder plates. Unfortunately, the side effect of
this backpack is that, despite Megabolt's large feet, he can't stand up
easily in this mode. I suppose this is also partially because of the rather
weak upper knee joints, and the fact that his legs, by design, slant forward
slightly. Still, this is a very nice mode, with very good detailing, both
mold-wise and paint-wise. The amount of detail on the robot head is simply
stunning, with a very "damaged" look to it. Megabolt also has pretty decent
articulation in this mode- all the standard points, but with an extra point
on each leg in exchange for no articulation in the waist. Megatron's "gimmick"
in this mode is pretty darn good, too- press his spark-crystal-button on
his chest (which still shows a Vehicon insignia, by the way), and a helmet-blaster
flips onto his head from his back! Not only that, but it stays on the head,
thanks to a small magnet on the back of it. The large gun on the top of
the helmet makes Megabolt look all the more menacing. It's your standard
missile-firing gun, too- it's not just there for looks. The helmet-gun
package DOES flip out a bit easier than I'd like, though, and sometimes
the large shoulder plates get in the way of the "flip action" as well.
Still, a very nice gimmick.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Megabolt Megatron is
a great toy, hands down- definitely worth your purchase just for the alt
mode alone. Couple that with an excellent- if rather top-heavy- robot mode,
and you've got a definite winner. Only a few, relatively minor, flaws with
this one.

      Embodies the cruel and destructive nature

himself to be Decepticon - a display of his arrogance. A battle-hardened
commander who wants nothing more than universal domination. Has led the
devastation of countless worlds before coming to Earth, and is set on eradicating
the Autobots. Developed "emissary mode" to combine with his space cruiser
and even the secret Autobot defense fortress in an attempt to gain absolute
power. In robot form, he attacks with energy claws and sonic missiles.
