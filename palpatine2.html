not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Emperor
Palpatine. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Have you ever seen Emperor
Palpatine dressed in white robes? No? Well, he apparently liked his giant
mechanoid to sport that color-- that is, until now. This much-more-appropriate
redeco of the Emperor puts him in the appropriate eeevil black-colored
robes he famously sports in the movies. It's not solely black, however--
there are certainly some contrasting paint applications used, mainly chalky
white and gray with some bluish gray to make his Mech face even more ugly.
All of the colors contrast wonderfully with the black, even if they leave
him looking rather monochrome (of course, color was never the Emperor's
strong suit in the first place). There's also some really nice, fairly
large Imperial emblems on the wings. Still, more paint apps would have
been appreciated, particularly on the wings and Mech legs, as he's still
got a whoooole lot of black that honestly looks boring in a few places.

     No mold changes have
been made to Emperor Palpatine 2.0, except that the miniature pilot figure
has been removed, due to the "Crossovers" Clone Wars packaging change that
accompanied the removal of all pilot figures from the line.

     Emperor Palpatine's
black redeco is what the toy should have sported the first time, quite
frankly, given that the color black is so associated with him. He could
have used some more paint applications, though the white and light gray
paint apps that he does have serve as marvelous contrast colors. Recommended
over this toy's original paint job.

       Emperor Palpatine hunts down the enemies
of the Republic wherever they are in the galaxy. He learns of a secret
gathering of Rebels and flies his Imperial shuttle to the location. When
he arrives, he uses the dark side of the Force to change the shuttle into
an enormous mech to crush his enemies!
