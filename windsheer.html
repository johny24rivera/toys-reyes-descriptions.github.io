    Mold History

   : Wind Sheer's mold
was first used for the Machine Wars toys Megatron and Megaplex back in
1997.

    Wind Sheer's vehicle
mode is a jet. The black is offset by the neon yellow very nicely- although
I'm not a big fan of using neon colors on Transformers, in this case, it's
a nice highlight. There's two Decepticon emblems on each of the wings,
which gives a sense of symmetry- especially when so many of the RiD toys
have only one emblem off-center, which is a bad kind of asymmetry. The
two tailfins also look rather nice, but, oddly, only one side is painted
with the neon yellow highlights, which kind of cheapens the effect a little.
The main problem with this mode, however, is that Wind Sheer's robot legs
and arms just sort of hang off the bottom of his jet mode. They can be
easily seen from any angle, even directly above. It doesn't make him look
like a convincing jet at all, and takes away from the "sleek" look of a
jet quite a bit. At least the little flip-out landing gears look cool,
though.

    Wind Sheer's robot mode
is very cool. The overall look and symmetry of the mode is very pleasing,
although the long, skinny elbows look rather odd when his arms are bent.
The cockpit on the chest and the wings on the back actually complement
the mode, rather than subtract from it. He has very good posability in
this mode- his head, shoulders, elbows, knees, and upper legs can all move
by ball joints. His gun, like his brother-in-design
    <a href="skyfire.html">
     Skyfire's
    </a>
    ,
is stored in two halves in the back of legs. So, you can use only one half
to make it a shorter gun, or connect and use both halves to create a longer,
"sniper" gun. Very nice. Wind Sheer's head is undoubtedly reminiscent of
the original Megatron's (and indeed, that was what the designers were going
for when the mold was originally released as Megatron as part of the
    <b>

    </b>
    line). and looks pretty nice. The light piping effect works
extraordinarily well on this toy, making Megatron's eyes glow even when
there's not that much light around.

    Wind Sheer is a very
nice toy in robot mode, but, like Skyfire, his vehicle mode could use a
little work. Although is color scheme is still pretty good, I think Skyfire's
blends together a bit better, which is why I recommend him over Wind Sheer.
Still, both are pretty neat toys in robot mode, and a recommended buy.

      Wind Sheer is fast and flashy as he
slices the sky at supersonic speed, doing acrobatic maneuvers when a single
flight would do. HeÂ’ll take risks just to show off his skill and not care
who gets into trouble with him. He loves to talk about how great he is,
and only his speed and skill keep the other Decepticons from grounding
him - permanently.
