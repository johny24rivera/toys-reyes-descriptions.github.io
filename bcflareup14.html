     Flareup is an "update"
to Botcon 2005's female motorcycle redeco
     <a href="flareup.html">
      who also
an Arcee redeco
     </a>
     , just like this one. This whole Knight 3-pack is sort
of a "celebration" of this being BotCon's 20th anniversary, so it makes
sense that they'd revisit some past exclusives. As with her initial appearance,
not-quite-Firestar has the primary colors of black and a fiery red. Needless
to say, both colors contrast very well together, and both are used in a
good enough amount where there isn't any large segment of the toy that's
too "one-tone". However, on the original Flareup, the orange was a nice
light chalky color that really contrasted well against the red. Here, it...
isn't. It's a duller shade-- metallic, but it's soooo close to the red
plastic it's painted against that it's barely visible. This is really unfortunate,
as there's some nifty paint apps made from it, like some angular "flame"
apps behind of and in front of the motorcycle seat. It's also used on the
flaps that form the side of the motorcycle mode, as well as on Flareup's
chest details in robot mode and on little bits on her lower arms. She does
have a nice light orange shade on the transparent plastic on her windshield,
though. Thankfully there's also a fair amount of silver on Flareup, from
her blade weapon to various angular details on her lower legs and motorcycle
tailpipe to part of the back of her motorcycle seat. It looks the best
on Flareup's "helmet" on her head, though. The head is definitely the best-looking
area of Flareup (color-wise), with the silver contrasting excellently with
the unique fleshy orange paint used on her face (again, aping her 2005
version), with some nice blue eyes to help offset the other colors. I wish
the fleshy orange had been used on a few more parts, it's such a nice accent
color. Lastly, Flareup has her light pale blue Knight symbol on the right
motorcycle side flap, complete with wings.

     BotCon 2014 Flareup
COULD have been a very nice-looking exclusive, and it still does look pretty
decent, but the failure of the orange to adequately stand out from the
red makes her less exciting than she should've been. Still, the red, black,
silver, and accent colors do go together fairly well, though not as well
as on the original Flareup-- this is a nice pickup if you don't have the
original, but if you CAN get the original Flareup for a reasonable price
I'd pick up that version over this one.

       Holding the rank of Knight Grenadier,
Flareup is the rookie of the team. While she may be young, she is also
a highly trained and quite capable munitions expert. Originally stationed
at New Polyhex, she trained under the ancient and mysterious group called
the Target Masters and became a star pupil in record time. Setting a new
standard for other trainees, Flareup even mastered the devastating and
controversial Darkmount Stratagem. This brought her name to the attention
of Knight Alpha Trizer, who recruited her directly from the academy for
his team of Cybertronian Knights. She demonstrates an uncharacteristically
cheerful disposition that can be disconcerting given her specialty, but
her bravery and purity of spark also serve as an inspiration.

       In robot mode, her exo-structure can
withstand extreme temperatures exceeding 8,000 Kelvin, and she carries
a super-heated vibroblade that can cut through and cauterize almost any
known substance. She is eager to please everyone, especially her leader
and newest mentor, Knight Ginrai. This proves difficult most of the time,
given the varied personas that comprise the Knights, but being young, her
optimism burns bright.
