    The Vehicons' alternate
mode of a stylized, Batmobile-esque car makes its transition very well
to this small Legion-class scale, with the proportions being pretty spot-on
to how they appear in the show (though the rear spoiler is just a tad oversized).
The usual Prime-style mold detailing of having mostly sparse detailing
with a few very intricate parts (like the front grill) is just as evident
on this figure as on most other Prime figures, and works quite well with
this slick of an alt mode. The paint detailing is also fairly well-done
in this mode as well, with all the windows painted a nice silver that contrasts
extremely well with the predominant color of a very dark-- almost black--
shade of purple. The headlights are silver, and some nicely painted light
purple "streaks" behind said headlights look very nice against the dark
purple too. Unfortunately, this Vehicon doesn't have the little light purple
lines on his grill, which make all the molded detail there a lot harder
to make out. Nothing on his back end is painted here either, though this
is because of the only noticeable issue I have with this mode-- the Vehicon's
feet just stick out the back end. Not VERY far, but far enough where they're
quite obvious from a side view, and even moreso from a rear-oriented view.
The feet are gray, too, making them stick out that much more. For a weapon,
the Vehicon comes with the standard Cyberverse-scaled light purple Decepticon
blaster weapon, which was pretty much made for this mold, as it looks pretty
similar to how the Vehicons' arms look when they convert them to weapon
mode in the show. There's a hole for it (and other Cyberverse-scaled weapons)
in the middle of the front hood of the car, as well as a hole for it on
the side of each car door.

    The transformation to
the Vehicon's robot mode is remarkably simple, even for a Legion-class
toy. You open up the hood, fold the head out, close it shut, and then just
separate out the arms and then the legs from the sides. Voila, robot mode!
On the plus side, the bit of hood over the Vehicon's head makes him look
more hunchbacked then he otherwise would have, and the gray legs break
up his colors a bit, even if the gray itself is a rather dull shade. The
mold detailing on his legs, chest, and head are also excellently done,
with the latter two having nicely painted silver details to help bring
out said detailing, and a nice red strip of paint across the visor on the
head. However, the roof of the car mode does stick out rather blatantly
from behind the back of the Vehicon in this mode, somewhat ruining what
would be a show-accurate lithe look otherwise. His arms-- which, as usual
for car Legion-class toys, are formed from the sides of his car mode--
are also a bit two-dimensional even for a Vehicon's arms, and worse, they
have very unsightly chunks of the spoiler hanging off them a little behind
the hands, which can impede movement a little. However, speaking of movement,
the Vehicon is a bit above-average for a Legion-class toy here; he can
move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and slightly up-and-down
at the head due to its transformation joint. Having knees on a Legion toy
is always appreciated, and combined with the nice shoulder movement, gives
the Vehicon a decent number of unique poses for a Cyberverse figure. Both
of his hands have been molded to hold his blaster weapon.

    The Cyberverse-scaled
Vehicon toy has a pretty nice car mode and a good number of paint apps
(with some obvious robot feet), though his robot mode fares a bit less
positively with some hunks of his car mode behind his back and arms ruining
his sleek silhouette a bit. Still, he's certainly not a bad toy, and given
the super-simple transformation and cheap pricepoint, this makes this release
of the Vehicon ideal for all you troop builders out there.

      The Vehicons aren't always happy about
their duties, but they follow orders without question. Mostly because they're
more afraid of their commanders than they are of whatever the Autobots
will do to them.
