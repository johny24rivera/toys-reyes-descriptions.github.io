    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Shockwave.

     Flash Sentry is essentially
a "transparent" version of
     <a href="bcreflector.html">
      Reflector
     </a>
     , though
it's not a one-to-one color change with the purple only being translucent.
Yes, Flash Sentry does have a lot of translucent purple plastic where Reflector
has dark royal purple and transparent green, but the solid plastic and
some of the paint apps have changed/been removed. First though, it's worth
noting that the translucent purple plastic looks pretty neat and is a nice
shade of the color, though it looks better in vehicle mode where the toy
is still translucent, but not so much so that you cna see the "hollowness"
in places like the robot legs. The biggest color-change to the toy is that
the light gray plastic on Reflector has been replaced with a dark lavender
plastic. This is definitely a better color than the light gray, and looks
better against the transparent plastic (though if the plastic weren't transparent,
Flash Sentry would be too one-tone, so I don't wish this same plastic had
been applied to Reflector). The same periwinkle/red/gray paint apps on
the lower legs that were on Reflector are replicated here, along with the
red on the eyes and lower arms. The Decepticon symbols are also in the
same places, and the "REFLECTOR" red text on the vehicle mode has been
slightly modified to say "REFLECTOR GT", with the "GT" of course standing
for Golden Ticket. There's also a black paint app near the bottom/rear
of each foot, but nowhere else on the figure, which is a little weird.
Still, Flash Sentry is definitely "paint-lite" so that his transparent
plastic can shine through.

     Flash Sentry has the
same head mold as Reflector, but has no unique mold changes of his own.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     I'm not generally a
fan of "this character but transparent (or black or chrome)" toys, but
the addition of lavender on the solid plastic and the couple of red paint
apps keep Flash Sentry from being a completely "one-gimmick" bot, looking
fairly nice by his own. Still, in a first (and apparently last) for BotCon,
you ONLY got a Flash Sentry if you purchased a Golden Ticket to BotCon
2016, which was limited to about 100 with the Golden Ticket costing over
$300 U.S. Thus, he is cray-cray expensive, even before you take into account
the aftermarket. Given that you get three Reflectors for a much cheaper
price if you get the troop builder set anyways, I'd only recommend Flash
Sentry if you are the HARDEST of hardcore completists.

       A member of the Photons, the primary
sub-faction led by Reflector, Flash Sentry is one of the higher-ranked
soldiers within his army. During the early days of the Great War, Megatron
needed more troops to fill out his ranks and cover all territory he would
soon be conquering and turned to Reflector who, due to his "Lightfield
Cybertronian" technology, can make dozens of warriors in his own image.
They are weak on their own, but strong in great numbers. When the war was
taken to Earth, Flash Sentry along with the Photons and their leader Reflector
were present to ensure Megatron's success against the Autobots. During
the Battle of Autobot City, most of the Photons and Flash Sentry himself
went missing in action.

       In Lightfield-Emitter mode, he can blind
most non-shaded Cybertronian optics with a single flare. The same ability
is replicated in his left arm cannon while in robot mode, but on a more
limited capacity due to the energon required for his humanoid motor functions.
