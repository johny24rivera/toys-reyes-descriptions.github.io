    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Armada Demolishor. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Armada Demolishor

     Like the deluxe truck
redeco of Optimus Prime released in the same wave, Demolishor is a repaint
of his Armada version, with no explanation given as to why he's suddenly
back in his first form. To fit him in with the Cyber Key gimmick of the
line, his Minicon Blackout has been replaced with a Cybertron Cyber Key,
with a painted-on Decepticon emblem and a Minicon port molded on its underside
so that the Cyber Key activates Demolishor's Minicon gimmick instead of
a Minicon itself. However, this means that Blackout's various ways of interacting
with Demolishor's vehicle mode aren't available with this release of the
toy, despite the fact that he still sells for $10 U.S.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Still, ignoring that
and the fact that this is the fourth time this mold has been released in
as many years, Cybertron Demolishor has a pretty good color scheme that's
unique enough from his previous paint jobs. He shares the same greenish-tan
base color scheme as his original paint job, but a dark jungle green is
now a main color of his as well, and combined with the brown "camo patterns"
on his upper legs and lower arms, it looks very cool and appropriately
military-ish. I do have to comment, though, that the brown camo paint apps
are rather sloppily done, and literally look as if someone just swept a
brown paintbrush briefly a few times over the parts. The milky brown and
black serve as the other main colors for Demolishor, and though they aren't
anything to write home about, they complement the other colors pretty well
and look nice. Same goes for the metallic rusty red paint apps on the lower
legs and chest.

     Cybertron Demolishor
is a nice, camoflauge-themed redeco of an excellent mold, but the mold
is definitely wearing out its welcome, and the replacement of a Minicon
with a remolded Cyber Key is rather cheap. Given that there's two paint
jobs this toy has had that are better than this color scheme--
     <a href="pldemolishor.html">
      Powerlinx
Demolishor
     </a>
     and the
     <a href="enkbdemolishor.html">
      Energon Armada Demolishor
     </a>
     redeco-- and that both of those come with an actual Minicon, I'm hesitant
to recommend this toy unless you're a big-time completist or absolutely
cannot find any other versions of this mold.

       Demolishor thinks just about as fast
as he drives. He has heard rumors about the return of Galvatron. Quite
frankly, he hoped they werent true. After working for the Decepticon leader
for years, hes been fine without someone bigger and badder than he is
to kick him around. Still, given how thick Cybertron has been getting with
Scrapmetal vermin, its be nice to have a few more Decepticons around to
back him up.
