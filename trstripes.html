    Stripes is a pretty awesome-looking
smartphone in alt mode. (As an aside, I'm glad they went with a more obscure,
previously Japanese-only character for

    yellow smartphone bot.) There's no extras from Stripes' other modes in
smartphone form as well. However, like the other Titans Return scout smartphone
"minions", he's slightly oddly-propotioned as a smartphone so he can fit
in TR Blaster's chest, being a bit thicker and smaller than your average
smartphone, with the screen not taking up quite as much as space as you'd
think. There's some nice tiger stripes all over the "screen" of the smartphone
(in actuality stickers), and some very nice stripe paint apps on the sides
of the smartphone, as well. Regarding the stickers, beyond the stripes
there's a nice big ol' Autobot symbol in the middle, with some nifty circuitry
lines on the "screen" and various symbols on the top and bottom that you'd
expect on a smartphone, from a battery life signal to an e-mail icon to
a wifi symbol. However, these stickers are rather flimsy, and given that
you have to move these pieces around during transformation, the edges can
peel a little, which is REALLY unfortunate-- I'm not sure why painted details
weren't used here. There's also some black down the middle, which contrasts
exellently with Stripes' other major color in this mode-- a rather medium
shade of milky orange, which is pretty much exactly the shade you'd expect
for a tiger. Finally, there's a couple of nice dark metallic gunmetal gray
paint apps near the corners-- so dark they're essentially black, for all
intents and purposes.

    Stripes' jet mode is
actually semi-decent for a tertiary mode. The front is a bit blocky for
a jet, but otherwise pretty decent-- the halves of the screen become rather
square but fairly nice-looking wings, while the jet nosecone and landing
gear/flight stand flip out from the bottom. It's here that we see a noticeable
addition to the color scheme-- a dull mustard yellow shade of plastic used
on the nosecone and the underside of the wings, which complements the orange
quite well in the amounts it's used. I'm glad it's not too bright, or it
might've tipped the color scheme a bit too far in that direction. There's
some nice mold detailing on the jet nose (given that, what with the smartphone
mode, Stripes is fairly sparse in that department on most of his other
pieces), and even the tiny little windows are painted black. The weak part
of this mode comes towards the rear-- two of the tiger legs are just folded
up in a rather obnoxious way. I guess the're SUPPOSED to imitate tailfins,
but they do a really poor job of looking like tiger legs. On a lesser note,
if you look straight-down in this mode you'll see the other two tiger legs
and a bit of a visible gap near the edges of the body, breaking the illusion
of the whole middle section being "solid". On a final note, there's two
little pegs on the top middle of this mode for a Titan Master to stand
on that are also there in the tiger mode.

    Speaking of Stripes'
tiger mode, it is definitely NOT impressive for what should be his secondary
mode. He's got all the necessary "parts"-- a fairly tiger-shaped body,
four legs, a tail and head-- but so much of it is FAR too skinny for a
tiger. The body isn't quite bulky enough, and the legs in particular are
way too lean. Add to this his little yellow stubb of a tail and the two
smartphone screen halves that stick out from above his butt very obviously
without any real attempt to "integrate" them into this mode, and you have
an underwhelming tiger. On the plus side, though, the amount of mold detailing
on a few parts-- such as the head and hips-- is quite impressive, though
something seems a bit "off" about Stripes' head. The molding is a bit too
detailed to the point where he looks a little ugly (though the silver paint
on the eyes and teeth helps separate out at least SOME details). Also,
oddly, his whole head is painted-- when you think it'd just be milky orange
plastic, it's actually a metallic orange. It's generally "close enough"
to the milky orange, but it's still a weird decision. I also do like that
the main body slopes up a bit near the front like an actual tiger's, and
Stripes does have pretty decent articulation for an animal-former of this
size; he can move up-and-down at the neck and tail, as well as at the shoulders
(ball joints) and back-and-forth at the hips, both sets of knees, and both
sets of ankles.

    Stripes has a pretty
nice color scheme and a pretty great smartphone mode, but that's where
most of his positives end. His jet mode is... okay, though very iffy in
the back, and his tiger mode has so many proportional maladies it's honestly
hard to take it seriously. If you want a beast minion for Blaster, this
is really your only option... but that doesn't mean it's necessarily a
good one; in fact, I think it's one of the worst molds out of the entire
Titans Return line. Too many sacrifices were made to make Stripes have
three modes.
