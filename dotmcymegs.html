    Megatron's MACK truck
vehicle mode has been a bit "shortened up" for this smaller Commander-class
version, sort of like when smaller toys of Prime only have his cab and
not his trailer. The back end of the truck bed has been done away with,
with now only that large canister portion sitting behind Megatron in vehicle
mode (you can unhitch the canister, though, if you want to give Megatron
a truck bed on this toy). Ignoring that sudden cut-off point, proportionally
this version of Megatron is fairly spot-on, though the front grill could
stick out a bit more and be more spiky. The color scheme of dull brown
and dark gray is really bland, but that's sort of the point-- to give Megatron
a dull, rusty look. The silver at least adds a bit of bright on him, and
the slight copper spray paint apps on the sides add a nice rusty touch.
The mold detailing is also fantastic, with even little details like rivets
popping up all over the place, so no issues there.

    Megatron's robot mode
is a bit less well-done, but hey, it's a Cyberverse figure, it's pretty
hard to get a movie design THAT accurate at this scale. The mold detailing
on his robot parts-- particularly his chest, head, and hands-- are great,
though they could use a bit more paint detailing in this mode. The upper
legs and chest in particular could use some color. The proportions are
definitely my biggest issue with this mode-- the arms are too overly skinny
for a big dude like Megatron, and there's a pretty big gap in between his
chest and his shoulders. His hips also start a little too far up, with
his legs thus being too long proportionally (though thankfully they're
of the right width overall). His feet are also merely details molded onto
the front of the truck sections of his lower legs, which doesn't look all
that hot. That said, Megatron does have pretty nice articulation for a
toy of this size-- he can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), hips, and knees (at two points)-- and most of these joints
are ball joints. Megatron's weapons are probably the coolest part of his
robot mode, as they're two large guns made up of the halves of the canister
from the back of his truck mode. He can hold each in his hands, though
admittedly they're a bit overly large proportionally. The cannons can also
be combined and clipped onto the side of one of his arms for a more "G1
arm cannon"-style look.

    DotM commander Megatron
has a pretty nice vehicle mode, articulation, and weapons, but his lack
of paint apps and good proportions in robot mode hurt him. Plus, I really
miss the cape that his

    has.
This is still an okay toy for the size, but if you have the money I'd spring
for the voyager class version instead.

      The fusion cannon Megatron carries is
widely feared as the most devastating weapon ever developed on Cybertron.
Sickeningly powerful and hugely destructive, even Megatron uses it only
in the most dire circumstances. No robot can stand against a full strength
blast from this mighty weapon.
