    Grimlock's wigged-out
t-rex form on this "Flip 'n Change" version is-- rather surprisingly, given
the simplstic, gimmicky nature of this subline-- his most well-proportioned
alt mode out of all of his figures in AoE. His legs are a touch large,
the tail maybe a TAD small, but that's about it-- otherwise, his head-body-arms
propprtions are quite good. There is one somewhat obvious robot mode extra
in this mode, and that's the robot chest plate, which is underneath Grimlock's
lower head and teeny t-rex arms. At a normal angle, however, it tends to
just look like an extra plate of plastic, and isn't that big of a deal.
It actually seems like the lesser of two evils, since if that part were
taken away, we'd have Grimlock's robot arms sticking out like sore thumbs
down there instead. (Said robot arms are still a LITTLE obvious behind
the t-rex arms, but only really around the fists.) The mold detailing on
this toy is quite good, with bone-like layered armor all over the place--
his tail looks particularly nice, as do his legs in this respect. His main
body is carved almost as if it were made of rocks, and the "scars" on the
hips are a nice touch. The head could have larger horns, but hey, we're
talking about a toy aimed at a younger-than-usual age group here, so it
makes sense they'd be a little nubby. Grimlock's color scheme is the same
as it is on most of his other toys, being mostly a rather unique shade
of brownish bronze, with some gray that's almost so dark as to be black
being the main dark color (it also has just a touch of a brownish tinge
to it, thus allowing it to both contrast and complement against the brownish
bronze). There's also a fair amount of silver on the legs and head for
a "light" color, and the electric blue used for the eyes may not be accurate
to the movie (where they'e red), but they still look nice against the other
colors. That said, the paint used for the brownish bronze-- as opposed
to the plastic color-- is of a noticeably lighter and more metallic shade,
so it doesn't blend in as well as it should. Between all this, Grimlock's
paint apps are pretty well-spaced out, so no complaints in terms of color
variety here. The big weakness here-- and oh, what a weakness it is-- is
that Grimlock has almost NO articulation. He can move back-and-forth where
his dino arms meet his body, but that's it. Not even some basic hip or
jaw articulation is really pushing it for a toy of this size (he's larger
than a voyager, but a little smaller than a leader), gimmick or no.

    Grimlock's transformation
is pretty fun, and the highlight of the toy-- you separate his tail into
two halves, swing those halves out, and then use them as handles, swinging
the entire toy around either forwards or backwards (depending upon what
mode you're transforming him into)-- after a couple of flips, he's transformed,
and you fold the tail halves behind his upper back. For Grimlock, you do
need to make sure that the dino head halves aren't pegged together tightly
before you start, though, otherwise that will keep the gimmick from working.
The end result is pretty good for a toy with a gimmicky transformation.
The tail halves behind his shoulders aren't movie-accurate, sure, but I
actually think they enhance his silhouette a little more, just like the
dino head-halves that are both movie-accurate and look uber-cool. The legs
stay the exact same as in dino mode. Grimlock's arms are a bit short and
stubby, but otherwise proportionally he's pretty darned good in this mode
(and hey, maybe having short stubby arms is okay for a robot who transforms
into a t-rex, huh? Hah...). There is a bit of a gap between his head and
his shoulders, though, which is a bit unsightly. The robot chest and head
are sculpted quite nicely, with the "teeth necklace" on the chest well-detailed
and painted, and his head pretty in-line with his other AoE toys, with
a large central crest and a mouth that looks like it's teeth hidden partially
by a unique pointy faceplate. I will say that, man, this guy needs a weapon,
though. Where's his mace, or a sword or something? He certainly has the
hand holes for one. For articulation, he can move at the elbows (at two
points), and that's it-- again, articulation is definitely this guy's biggest
drawback. And even here, his little t-rex arms on the back of his lower
robot arms can collide with his tail halves and get in the way of what
little movement they have.

    Flip 'n Change Grimlock
may be a simple toy, but he's a fun toy with a fun transformation gimmick,
and proportions-wise he hits nearly all of the right notes in both of his
modes without a bunch of kibble-- even the tail halves frame his robot
mode rather nicely, in my opinion. His color scheme and number of paint
apps are also solid, but his articulation is where he falls flat-- a point
of movement or two for each of his arms in each mode. Particularly since
his legs remain the same in both modes, I see no reason why a couple of
points of movement couldn't have been added in there. Regardless, this
is my favorite toy from the subline because of just how few drawbacks he
has besides his articulation. If you're looking for an
    <i>
     Age of Extinction
    </i>
    Grimlock toy that's easy and fun to transform and lack of articulation
isn't a turn-off, I'd recommend this over all the other "non-Generations"
toys of the design.
