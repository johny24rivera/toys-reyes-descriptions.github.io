    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself,

     Ultra Magnus' color scheme
doesn't really deviate from what it's traditionally been for this toy;
his main colors are still the rather patriotic red, white, and blue that
they've almost always been. The blue and white are particularly "pure"
colors and go very well together-- though if that were it, the color scheme
would be a bit too light, even though the blue is just a shade or two darker
than is typical of Ultra Magnus toys. The red paint on the robot chest
and shoulders really help break things up, to the point where I wish it
had been a bit more prevalent, particularly on the legs. Ultra Magnus also
has a fair amount of that really blah light milky gray, which I've never
been fond of-- I get why it can't all be painted an eye-catching silver
like his feet, but why not a more metallic, eye-catching shade of plastic,
Hasbro? Anyways, I wish the gray was just a bit darker regardless, to add
some more "dark" to Magnus' overall color scheme, but at least the gray
is broken up adequately by all of the other colors. Really, the combination
of all the different colors of plastic and good placement of his many paint
apps helps keep Ultra Magnus interesting visually in both modes, with no
large area of any one color.

     As you'd expect given
that he's a reuse of Optimus Prime, Ultra Magnus does have some mold changes
made. His shoulder pads/truck top pieces and robot chest are the most obvious
differences, both of them molded primarily for the robot mode. It seems
that no matter what, Beast Hunters Ultra Magnus just can't escape having
some rather bad issues with his vehicle mode, and this version's no exception.
The altered shoulder pads and chest may look good in robot mode, but in
vehicle mode they leave the white upper arms and ball joint even more obvious
than they already were (mostly due to color breakup, admittedly, but these
remolded parts certainly don't help), and Ultra Magnus' chest does NOT
look like truck windows, making his vehicle mode look essentially "window-less"--
this remold's biggest issue, in my opinion. The robot head has also been
remolded, and is spot-on show-accurate, with really fine details and some
nice paintwork-- I'm particularly surprised that they even managed to paint
his tiny eyes a lighter shade of blue that what's on the rest of him! Magnus
also gets his now-signature Forge of Solus Prime weapon, which can store
out-of-the-way on his truck bed in vehicle mode and can be held easily
in either hand in robot mode. The mold detailing on it is excellent, though
color-wise it's not accurate-- the metallic silvery blue hammer heads look
decent enough, but having the rest of the body of his hammer be blue is
completely inaccurate. There's also a big obvious peg sticking out of the
side of the hammer, though I can't see how Hasbro could get around this
and still have the weapon store in vehicle mode. On a lesser note, the
hammer is also a touch undersized, though it would really get obnoxious
in vehicle mode if it was much bigger, so I'm okay with it this size considering
the mold constraints.

Ultra Magnus is a pretty darned good mold, though the added shoulder pads
and robot chest-- despite looking good in robot mode-- really take away
some key aspects of the vehicle mode. He's got a cool weapon, though, along
with a pretty good color scheme that catches my eye more than the previous
uses of this mold as Optimus. I'd recommend the
     <a href="pribhmagnus.html">
      voyager
version
     </a>
     over this, but if you're willing to overlook some vehicle mode
oddities this is still a pretty good design and recommended (assuming you
can find it-- it is a bit harder to find than normal, given that it wasn't
released in U.S. markets).
