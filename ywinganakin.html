    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Y-Wing
Pilot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
SWTF Y-Wing Pilot

     Most of this version
of Anakin Skywalker isn't really a repaint compared to the previous release
of this mold as a simple Y-Wing Pilot. White and yellow are still easily
the dominant colors, though a few subtle changes have been made with a
slightly brighter yellow and a slightly different deco job with the stripes
on vehicle mode. However, in mech mode the changes are quite obvious, with
the colors on the chest, head, and arms being changed to closely mimic
Anakin's. He looks quite good overall, and helps keep the toy from simply
being all yellow-and-white. The shades of brown on the arms are particularly
nice. However, there is a downside to this sudden change of color in mech
mode, as in vehicle mode parts that normally wouldn't be obvious-- such
as the arms on the bottom near the rear of the nosecone-- are made blatantly
so by the change in color, thus ruining the illusion of a "genuine" Y-Wing
a bit.

     As expected, Anakin
has a new head mold to match how he looks in the Clone Wars cartoon. The
head mold is okay, but I think the hair is a little
     <i>
      too
     </i>
     ... "hair-like"
and would have preferred ot to be a bit more square of a head to emphasize
the robotic-ness of it. It also uses a rather bleh shade of fleshy pinkish
brown for the face. Also, Anakin Skywalker comes with a lightsaber weapon,
giving him a one-up in that department compared to the Y-Wing Pilot. However,
it can't store anywhere in vehicle mode.

     The Y-Wing version of
Anakin Skywalker is, I think, ever-so-slightly better than the Y-Wing Pilot,
due to a more interesting color scheme in robot mode, even if that means
a mech mode parts are a bit more obvious in vehicle mode. I do prefer the
Y-Wing Pilot's head mold, though, and there's already been lots of Anakin
SWTF toys released by this point, so... really, it's a toss-up more or
less. It comes down to simply if you want another Anakin or another Clone
Pilot when it comes to which version of this mold I'd recommend for you.

       Anakin flies a Y-wing bomber to capture
Cad Bane, the bounty hunter who invaded the Senate building and escaped
with important information and hostages. Bane morphs his ship into an enormous

his Y-wing into a huge mech loaded with firepower!
