       This version of Bonecrusher
is more of a variant with battle damage as opposed to a true "redeco".
The main difference color-wise is that this version's tan is a few shades
lighter than the original's, giving it a little more of a washed-out, "desert-y"
look. The biggest difference when it comes to his paint apps are that Bonecrusher
now has several "paint scar" paint apps along a fair amount of his vehicle
mode and parts of his robot mode, as well. I love the asymmetrical look
that this gives to Bonecrusher, particularly in robot mode where it looks
like he's only half-functioning. The copper also looks good on the parts
of his robot mode that it's painted on. However, all the "battle damage"
paint apps do take away a few of Bonecrusher's previous paint apps-- his
headlights are now bare, as well as a few other minor paint apps in robot
mode. Overall I think the trade-off is worth it, though. The shades of
pea green and dark dull gray plastic are the same on this version compared
with the initial, as are the shades of light metallic silvery blue and
light red used for paint applications.

           Offroad
Ironhide
          </a>
          redeco. A dull, flat blue is the main color on this Ironhide,
as opposed to black. Gray is still Ironhide's other main color, but it's
a bit duller on this version, giving Ironhide a less-contrasty, more "muted"
look this time around, but also one that isn't as monochrome as his movie-accurate
deco. Just like Offroad Ironhide, this version also has some mud "splatters"
on his vehicle mode, which look quite good this time around, with some
nice spray apps just about where you'd expect to see them. That said, the
tires are also a rather ugly grayish brown to try to make them look muddy--
it doesn't really work. They're too brown with not enough black/gray in
the mix, and it just ends up looking wrong. Beyond the obvious mud splatters
and a healthy dose of silver to make him look more metallic and provide
contrast, Ironhide has several colors devoted entirely to accents here
and there-- the light electric blue on some of his robot parts, a dark
gunmetal gray front bumper, golden-yellow headlights, dull red taillights,
metallic silvery blue on his front window... all of the paint apps look
great where they are, and help to give a bit more variation to the overall
dull color scheme. That said, the huge silver Autobot symbol on the roof
is a bit much (I've never been a big fan of huge allegiance symbols-- they
might as well be bullseyes for these "robots in disguise"). Some paint
apps on his rooflights and head also wouldn't have hurt, but those are
the only real places where there's some details
          <i>

          needing

            The "Fury of Bonecrusher"
set is the better of the two Wal-Mart "Hunt for the Decepticons" voyager/deluxe
two-packs, with both toys being solid molds with good color schemes. I
wish Bonecrusher wasn't so similiar to his initial release, but this version
of Ironhide color-wise comes out slightly ahead of Recon Ironhide, and
with all the same awesome accessories. If you don't have the initial deluxe
version of the Bonecrusher mold, this set is a very easy recommendation;
if you do, you may want to just buy the RotF Recon Ironhide mold seperately,
as this Ironhide's deco job isn't SO good where I'd recommend it despite
essentially getting a double of your Bonecrusher.
