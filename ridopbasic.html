the super version of the same character, the basic version of Optimus Prime
was a mold made exclusively for RiD.

    Vehicle mode is a fire
truck. This mode is nearly right-on when compared to his
    <a href="ridprime.html">
     Super
version
    </a>
    . He's very accurate in nearly all aspects. The ony aspect that
he could use something, though, is in paint detailing. There's some of
it- under the ladder platform and on the windows- but that's really it.
Some silver detailing on the top front of the middle would have been appreciated.
Also, even though Prime has six tires, only four of them are real, spinning
ones. Two of them are just molded on, and without any paint detailing on
them to even disguise them like the other ones! Kinda took the cheap way
out there. Prime's "super mode" extras are NOT in the middle of the truck
this time, though, unlike the Super version which is good. The ladder is
pretty much the only moving piece in this mode- the base can rotate, and
the ladder can slide back and forth.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is very similar to the Super version's "Super" robot mode, even though
the transformation is totally different. His Super version's "regular"
robot mode is completely skipped in this toy, due to its size. The detailing
on this mode is much better than in the vehicle mode, but it still needs
a little more on the chest area. This mode wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't
for two major things. First off, Prime's back third of the fire truck just
hangs off his upper back, and not only hampers the look of the toy a lot
in this mode, but also gets in the way quite a bit. Secondly, Prime's feet
are curved upwards towards the back, as they're the front parts of his
fire truck mode. Because of this, he falls over very easily, even when
his fire truck ladder adds a bit of support. Without the ladder, it's impossible
to stand him up by himself, with gets really annoying if you want to use
the end of the ladder as a gun of some sorts that he has to hold. His articulation
is also rather limited in this mode- his head can move, as well as his
arms at the shoulders. His legs can also move from side to side, but that's
it. And it wouldn't have been that hard to give him some knee articulation
or something, either, which makes it that much more annoying. Oh, and this
version of Optimus Prime cannot combine with the basic version of
    <a href="ultramagnusbasic.html">
     Ultra
Magnus
    </a>
    , so don't expect to have a little
    <a href="omegaprime.html">

    or anything.

    Although it's certainly
cheaper than the super version, so less features are expected, Optimus
Prime just doesn't measure up in this version. His truck mode, although
good-looking, lacks paint details, and his robot mode falls over way too
easily and has a large backpack. Even though he's much more costly, I'd
recommend the Super version of Optimus Prime instead unless you're a completist.
