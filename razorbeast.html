    Beast mode is a warthog.
Looks very nice in this mode, although he has an odd tan stripe running
down his back. The robot legs are somewhat apparent from a horizontal or
rear view, however. The articulation in this mode is also very limited,
as he can only move his legs.

    Robot mode is disappointing,
however. Although his basic body structure is nice, he has an extremely
large backpack of his robot parts on his back, making them stick out
and interfere a lot. However, the backpack is not quite as big as, say,
    <a href="rattrap.html">
     Rattrap's
    </a>
    . Also, his gun is his hair in beast
mode, which is a very odd idea. This mode has very good poseability.

    An okay transformer,
but it has its downsides. Somewhat recommended.
