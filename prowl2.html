    Mold History
   </b>
   : Prowl 2's mold was
originally planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers: Generation
2, but it never went through. Now his mold finally sees release for RiD!

    Prowl 2's vehicle mode
is a police car. However, it's not the same type of police car as the
    <a href="ridprowl.html">
     Deluxe
mold of Prowl
    </a>
    , so Hasbro simply renamed it "Prowl 2". Come ON, Hasbro!
If it's not going to be a smaller mold of the same character (which it's
obviously not), then at least come up with a new name instead of taking
a "2" at the end! Anyway, stupid name aside, Prowl 2 is pretty nice in
this mode. The windows are painted a very nice color, and the white and
dark blue go together pretty nicely. The gold stripe on the bottom sides
is also a nice touch, as is the silver-painted bumper. The back lights
and bumper aren't painted however, even though the details are there, which
is kind of odd. The pink used for the lights is a bit too light as well-
red would have been a better choice for sirens. Still, this is a pretty
good mode, and, like the other Wave 2 Spychangers, Prowl 2 has his gun
storable in this mode. Many people seem to think this mode is rather boring,
but I don't see it, especially since he's got more colors than most of
the other Spychangers...

    Like most of the other
Spychangers, Prowl 2 has a pretty crummy-looking robot mode. When flipping
down his hood to transform him into this mode, it's also pretty hard to
do so without scratching some stupid tab on his arms- I don't know why
they're there, they just get in the way. He can only move his arms at the
shoulders in this mode, which severely limits playability; like the other
Spychangers, Prowl 2's legs are just one solid piece. Like most of the
other Spychangers, Prowl 2's chest sticks out much too far for my liking,
although at least it fits snugly, unlike most of the other Wave 2 Spychanger's.
His arms are just molded onto the inside of his much-larger car doors,
so that looks pretty bad as well. His head is rather cool-looking, although
I wish his optics were a different color than the outside of his face.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overall, Prowl 2 is
pretty much "average" compared to the other Spychangers. At least he can
store his gun in vehicle mode, though. Still, he's not something you'd
get real anxious about getting.
