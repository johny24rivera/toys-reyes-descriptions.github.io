    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars deluxe Groove.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Combiner Wars deluxe

     Kinda interesting that
the redeco of a motorcycle into Wreck-Gar was done of the more realistic

      Afterbreaker
     </a>
     ,
but I suppose that's because Afterbreaker is already orange, so it would
make him and Wreck-Gar too similar color-wise. Anyways, this toy largely
has the colors you'd expect from a Wreck-Gar toy, with a dull, somewhat
milky shade of orange forming the main color. Most of the connector pieces--
as well as the combiner port in his chest, his weapon, and the middle portion
of his Prime armor-- are that very blah, light milky gray shade of plastic,
which I don't like, but at least it's not used on any particularly large
pieces. Black is also used a fair amount-- on his wheels, as well as on
most of his Prime armor piece. It's also used on the top of the central
part of the vehicle mode, and on some paint apps on his chest. The lesser-used
colors are what helps make this color scheme more attractive, though, with
a dull glossy brown used paint for his seat/kneecaps, feet, shoulders,
and on his facial hair. Red is also used on his robot chest and wheel hubs,
and silver on his face and on much of the clear piece of plastic that makes
up the windshield and headlights of his vehicle mode. Overall, it's not
exactly an attention-getting color scheme, but it works for the character
pretty well. The red complements the orange well, though I wish it were
a titch lighter for better contrast-- and it does contrast against the
black excellently anyways. The brown goes pretty well thematically with
the orange, and at least the light milky gray breaks up a lot of the orange
even if I don't like the particular shade.

     PotP Wreck-Gar has a
couple of mold changes, the first of which is a new headsculpt, and it's...
servicable. The actual face looks pretty good and is well-sculpted, complete
with painted factual hair, though the expression on his face is rather
neutral, not really getting across his personality. The sides of his face
fan out nicely, but the "motorcycle front" portion that makes up his forehead
has been shrunk a fair amount-- especially the handlebars-- because of
space limitations for it in alt mode. Wreck-Gar also comes with a piece
of Prime Armor, of course, compared to a Combiner Wars hand/foot/gun, though
his chest hasn't been remolded for him to actually use it as chest armor--
it's pretty much just an extra accessory used for a hand or part of a foot
in combiner mode. Finally, Wreck-Gar also comes with the same long spinner-axe
weapon that came with his
     <a href="aawreckgar.html">
      Reveal the Shield version
     </a>
     ,
though this toy can only hold it from the very bottom of the shaft. It
can also only really store in the vehicle mode by clipping it onto the
side of the handlebar, which is... awkward, to say the least.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     PotP Wreck-Gar definitely
seems like a last-minute idea for the line-- even though the mold itself
is quite well-designed, all the changes made to the mold itself have definite
limitations. The headsculpt is too small; the Prime Armor can't do anything
for him as an individual; and his weapon can only be wielded rather awkwardly.
Overall if you're a huge Wreck-Gar fan, maybe this is worth it if you really
want him to form a Combiner limb, but there's been multiple better toys
of him released. You won't miss much by skipping this version.
