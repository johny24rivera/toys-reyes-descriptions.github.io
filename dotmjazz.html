    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie deluxe
Jazz toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Even though he's been
dead for two movies, that doesn't stop Jazz from getting another redeco
for Dark of the Moon! Like the other toys in his deluxe "Cyberglyph" assortment,
this Jazz has a pretty good amount of plastic that is a rather nifty "translucent"
color, in that there's a BIT of transparency in there, but you can't see
all the way through the plastic to the parts underneath like straight-out
"transparent" plastic parts. This makes for a pretty nifty-looking "stealth"
look in vehicle mode, as even the windows are done up in this plastic (and
it works, given the smoky color of the translucent gray). He has a few
"Cyberglyph" tattoos on him to help him fit in more thematically with his
fellow Target exclusives, though honestly they're not as much of an eye
draw as on the other "Cyberglyph" figures, given how close the black of
the glyphs is to the dark gray of the plastic they're on. His robot mode
colors are considerably more "business as usual" for a movie Jazz toy,
with a rather blah shade of milky gray that contrasts decently enough with
bronze paint apps &amp; plastic, as well as some black here and there.
A couple of paint apps-- such as the silver on his face and knees, the
silvery light blue on his headlights, and especially the light red on his
taillights and a few minor details in robot mode-- help to keep Jazz from
looking too monochrome. Even just the touches of light red against the
translucent dark gray really work wonders in terms of catching the eye.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Jazz.

     "Cyberglyph" Jazz has
a really neat effect with his smoky gray translucent plastic in vehicle
mode, though his robot mode is fairly unremarkable and boring comparatively
(though to be fair, in robot mode he looks more accurate to his movie coloration).
I think this is a cool "themed" redeco if you're into that, and it certainly
looks better than the initial release of this mold, but personally I think
the
     <a href="movg1jazz.html">
      "G1"-colored
     </a>
     and
     <a href="premjazz.html">
      "Premium"
     </a>
     releases from the first movie line make this mold look a bit better than
this version.

       Even though Autobot Jazz adopts aspects
of every culture he visits, he also retains many of the traditions of ancient
Cybertron. These traditions are important to him-- they ground him and
help him to appreciate the new and exciting things around him. One of those
ancient traditions is the inscription of glyphs on his armor before battle,
a task he goes about with grave seriousness.
