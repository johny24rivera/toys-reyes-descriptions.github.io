    Beast mode is a pterodactyl.
This is a repaint of
    <a href="terrorsaur.html">
     Terrorsaur
    </a>
    . While I
think the color scheme is cooler, it still suffers from the same, if not
more, flaws that Terrorsaur suffered from. There are few movable joints
in beast mode, only his mouth and legs- you think Hasbro would have at
least let his wings flap, or something. Also, his robot legs are pretty
easily seen on his beast mode bottom, as are the robot hands on the back
of his feet. The detailing isn't very good in this mode, either.

    Robot mode looks more
like a Maximal than a Predacon, but still has a certain level of fierceness
to it. His wings and pterodactyl head cannot fold back in this mode, and
stick out a bit and get in the way a little. His gun is small, but is still
an okay accessory, although it is easy to lose. Even easier to lose, in
fact, than the original Terrorsaur's, because there is no little plastic
tab that keeps the gun from sliding out of Lazorbeak's back in this mode,
while there was such a tab on Terrorsaur.

    Cool-looking, but not
the best transformer to make a repaint of.

      A fast flying sky piratewith a thirst
for battle, Lazorbeak upholds his motto of believing the only good point
he likes about the Maximals is their melting point. His laser weapon can
melt through most of the Maximals' battle armor, but such aggression tends
to drain his energon levels, allowing him to initialize only brief periods
of aerial attack sequences between robot and pterodactyl modes. Still,
when his power levels are charged, he's one mean menace!
