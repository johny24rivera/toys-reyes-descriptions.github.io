    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cyber Battalion Prowl.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cyber Battalion Prowl

     When Hasbro makes a toy
of Prowl, you can be pretty sure they'll eventually redeco/remold into

      Bluestreak
     </a>
     and/or
     <a href="cwsmokescreen.html">

     . For Cyber Battalion
Prowl, though, they went with a fairly big-name TF character that I wouldn't
have expected; Sideswipe. Sure, Sideswipe's a car, but Sideswipe's chest
has almost always had the car hood pointing down for his chest, not forward.
Kinda surprising he was picked, but the end result certainly stays very
close to Sideswipe's traditional, rather simple color scheme-- all of his
plastic is either white, black, or red, with the red being a slightly lighter
shade than you'd usually find on one of his toys. It still contrasts excellently
with the black, and the white works well against both. The black is used
on the car windows, wheels, parts of the front grill, and robot head, waist,
shoulders, and fists. Red is saved for pretty much the other "vehicle-exclusive"
parts-- making the car mode very red indeed-- while the other "robot-exclusive"
parts are white, making for a pretty varied color scheme in the latter
mode. He does have some silver paint on his face and light blue paint on
his eyes, but that's it as far as other colors. Thus, despite the three
main colors being varied up, I would've liked at least a bit more accents
thrown in the mix-- like silver or yellow on his headlights, for example.

     Sideswipe has three
mold changes made when compared to his predecessor Prowl. The front section
of the vehicle/chest has been changed, with the grill being the most obvious
change-- it's now less "smooth" of a grill, with the top of the front and
the bottom both jutting out a bit, and the portion near the middle actually
furthest "back" on the chest/grill. There's two sets of two headlights
molded into the top side portions of the grill and painted white, while
a "U"-shaped vented grill covers most of the distance between them, and
then there's a black rim on the bottom. It looks good, and works well on
a Lambourghini, but on this generic car not quite so much-- I prefer Prowl's
more traditional grill. Sideswipe, of course, has a new headsculpt, and
it's spot-on in all respects. Perfectly proportioned, nice, sharp details--
just like the G1 animation model plopped onto this toy. He's got the "normal"
face, side chin guards, small antennae on the sides, and large, slanted
forehead piece. Finally, the sirens have been removed from the top of the
car/feet, making Sideswipe appropriately a more "normal" car than Prowl.

     I'm a bit conflicted
on Cyber Battalion Sideswipe. On one hand, I think his overall color scheme--
though simple-- looks good, especially in robot mode, and outdoes Prowl's.
On the other hand, the style of car and the grill jutting forward on the
chest isn't how his G1 design has been depicted, so I felt this was a wasted
opportunity to do one of the MANY other G1 bots who have the car grill
on their chest in a manner akin to Prowl instead. Still, overall I think
he tops Prowl
