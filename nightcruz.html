    Mold History
   </b>
   : Nightcruz's mold was
originally used for the Beast Machines: Battle for the Spark toy Spystreak,
which came out back in 2001.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines: BFTS Spy
Streak. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines:

     Nightcruz is almost the
polar opposite of his predecessor Spy Streak. In place of Spy Streak's
red, Nightcruz has a very soft blue. In place of the rusty brown Spy Streak
had, Nightcruz has "chalky" white-gray and black. There's also a bit of
yellow-green on Nightcruz as well. Although some people aren't that fond
of the "baby blue" part of Nightcruz, I think it goes together well with
his black to create a very "nighttime" effect, which is, of course, fitting,
considering his name. The transparent green-yellow I'm not too crazy about,
however- it's almost exactly the same color as...pee. Ick. Other than that,
though, Nightcruz looks good, and, in my opinion, slightly better than
his predecessor Spy Streak, who needed some black to round out his color
scheme. An interesting note, however- in place of a Vehicon spark crystal,
Nightcruz now has a solid red orb. I would have preferred an Autobot spark
crystal, but Hasbro admits that these repaints were rushed a bit to fill
out the end of the line. At least Nightcruz has an Autobot symbol on his
left wing (although I would have preferred it on both).

     Nightcruz has no mold
changes from its previous use, so Nightcruz retains all the positives and
negatives of Spy Streak in that area.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nightcruz's color scheme
is a slight improvement over Spy Streak's, except for the transparent yellow-green.
Other than that, my only complaint about the reuse of this mold is that
it's an Autobot- a Decepticon would have been so much more fitting, given
the color scheme. Still, Nightcruz is quite a bargain, as he comes with
two other basic-sized toys for just $15 U.S.
