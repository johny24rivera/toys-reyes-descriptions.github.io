      Rampage's color scheme
is based off of the G1 Predacon of the same name, and shares the same beast
mode as well, which is certainly a plus. The reddish-orange is a particularly
good shade of the color, and the gold serves as a magnficient highlighting
color. What small bits of black and gold there are look good, too. However,
as good a color as it is, Rampage still has too much orange on him-- it
either needs to be broken up with more paint apps or some of his plastic
should have been molded in another color. Also, when taken by itself it's
not at all a bad color scheme, but it's REALLY similar to this mold's previous
color scheme, only with the orange being a bit more reddish and the black
stripes being replaced with a few gold paint apps. Considering the prices
that one has to pay for exclusives like this, a bit more effort to differentiate
them from the originals would have been appreciated.

        Rampage's mind is always working furiously.
During his time as one of Razorclaw's students, he would often begin on
a new assignment before finishing the previous one. The war did not diminish
his enthusiasm; it allowed him to simply reorient his focus on warfare.
He would often destroy twice as many Autobots as Razorclaw or Divebomb
by constantly trying out new and more efficient ways of dispatching with
his enemies. Watching alien transmissions tends to calm him down. It was
Rampage who presented Razorclaw with transmissions showing predators that
became the basis for the alternate mode designs of the Predacons when they
joined the Decepticon army.

          Megatron retains some
of his classic colors-- namely, light gray and black-- but he's got enough
unique twists to definitely set him apart as a seperate "mirror-verse"
character. For one, he's got a lot more black than Megatron traditionally
had, including on his brand-new head mold. The head mold makes Megatron
look very beneficient, something that admittedly had to be a bit hard to
pull off by the sculptor, since we're so used to seeing Megatron being
the master of evil. His expression looks very peaceful, and his helmet
is a bit less "bucket"-shaped, hearkening back to how his helmet originally
looked in the early Marvel G1 comics. Red and blue are new colors for Megs,
but he pulls them off well-- in addition to being traditionally "good"
colors on TFs, which help with the whole "good bad guy" image, they contrast
remarkably well with the black and gray. Megatron's also got quite a few
paint apps, so no complaints about large open spaces of the same color
here. My only real complaint about the figure as far as the color scheme
goes is the same complaint I have with Rampage-- the original Energon Megatron
was mostly light gray, and this version of Megatron has light gray in almost
all the same spots, too. I mean, I know that they're Megatron's traditional
colors, but c'mon, mix it up at least a little, maybe by swapping where
the black and gray were, for example. Or even something like painted over
the gray with a fine silver finish would have really helped it look great--
after all, this is a Botcon exclusive, you might as well spare no expense.

            As a young mathematician, Megatron lectured
at one of Cybertron's most prestigious universities. During the course
of his own studies, he had developed a set of equations that could predict
social trends in a given society. He was alarmed when these trends pointed
to a civil war on Cybertron. His colleagues dismissed his work as the paranoid
ranting of a lunatic. He saw them as simply misguided and he retreated
underground to prepare for the coming war. When Optimus Prime began his
march across Cybertron, Megatron was ready. He had developed the art of
transformation, refashioning his own body into one capable of converting
to an aerial vehicle of tremendous power. While Optimus spread the gospel
of destruction and conquest, Megatron championed compassion, courage and
freedom. His charisma and humor in the face of a war helped him form a
united front against the Autobots. Though Megatron is a pacifist at heart,
he has the soul of a warrior as many have discovered time and again.

            The Megatron &amp; Rampage
set is an interesting take on the molds-- the former more than the latter--
but both suffer from having a major color almost exactly the same as their
molds' previous release, which knocks them down quite a few pegs in my
book. For such an expensive set, this isn't really something to brag about.
Still, Megatron has quite the unique color scheme, and it's very intriguing
to see a "good" Megatron for once.
