    Beast mode is a german
shepherd. Although he is a repaint of
    <a href="wolfang.html">
     Wolfang
    </a>
    ,
some parts have been modified that make this repaint better than the original.
He is slightly bigger than Wolfang, with a longer back and longer tail.
Almost no extras except for his robot hands on his belly and the back of
his back legs, which are smooth and painted white and blue, like most of
his robot mode. There is not many movable parts in this mode, however;
only his back legs can move.

    Robot mode has a lot
of extras, which is why this didnt earn a higher rating. There are little
flesh plates that stick out of his midsection, his front feet stick out
of his upper arms, and his beast face plates are large and limit movement.
However, his mask is cooler-looking(at least in my opinion) than Wolfangs,
and bigger, as is his shield and gun that fires grappling hooks. The detailing
is also very good, too.

    A very nice toy, although
it has a lot of extras in his robot mode.

      Placed in charge of guarding his fellow
Maximals from a surprise Predacon attack, K-9 is always alert thanks to
his lightning-fast reflexes and ultra-sensitive canine nose. While other
Maximals plot defense strategies, K-9 stands guard to survey the surrounding
area for signs of Predacon spies. But even if he encounters an entire attack
force, he can hold them off with his fast-fire missile launcher until reinforcements
arrive. When it comes to combat, K-9's bite is definitely worse than his
bark!
