    Mold History
   </b>
   : Jhiaxus' mold was
originally used for the deluxe version of Beast Machines Jetstorm, which
came out back in 2000.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to deluxe Beast Machines Jetstorm.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of deluxe Beast Machines
Jetstorm

     The fourth iteration
of the Beast Machines deluxe Jetstorm mold is probably the worst. For starters,
he's Jhiaxus has got the same problem here that his previous mold buddy
     <a href="stormjet.html">
      Storm Jet
     </a>
     had- he's only got a few colors on
him. Granted, they're spaced out over the toy so it's not as obvious, but
still... more colors should have been added on a deluxe toy. He's also
got the exact same paint apps as Storm Jet (just in different colors),
so there's not much imagination that went into his design there. He's also
got the same exact colors of black and transparent red that were on Storm
Jet in their respective places. The relationship between the two is undeniable.
However, whereas Storm Jet at least has a good color scheme, Jhiaxus really
doesn't. The bright orange and gray really don't work well together- instead
of the orange, maybe gold, with the gray a bit darker? He's also prone
to the same "sticky elbows" situation that the Storm Jet version of the
Deluxe Jetstorm mold had. What makes it even worse is that Jhiaxus' name
is taken from a popular G2 comic book character, but his color scheme couldn't
be FARTHER from Jhiaxus' G2 color scheme. (Which was green, gold and red,
if I remember correctly.) Why give him the brand-new name if he doesn't
resemble the character? At least he has some nice Decepticon symbols tampoed
on his cockpit and his spark crystal.

     No mold changes have

     Jhiaxus- or, as I like
to call him, Halloweenie- is definitely the Jetstorm repaint that has had
the least thought put into him. Same paint apps as Storm Jet, but with
an ugly orange dominating his color scheme. It's a shame, because the mold
itself is great. Not recommended unless you can't find any other versions
of this mold at a reasonable price.
