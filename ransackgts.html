    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Ransack. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Cybertron Ransack

     Ransack's new color scheme
is very different from his original, mostly light red scheme, and it has
a lot more contrast. The main base colors are a pretty standard black and
white, but all the gold paint apps really work well to help contrast against
the black, and the transparent green wheels and chest plate look REALLY
awesome against both the white and the black. There's also a bit of silvery
blue thrown in to add a little more variety in there, and it works very
well where it's placed. What is noticeable is that Ransack GTS has a few
more paint apps then the original Ransack did, and they're a bit more spread
out so that no large part of Ransack looks bereft of paint detailing. Ransack
also has a fully painted Cyber Key, unlike his first release. The fully-painted
Decepticon emblem on the robot chest, instead of just a small black Decepticon
symbol on the side of his gun like on the original Ransack, is a much better
place for said emblem. The overall color scheme also looks great next to
Ransack's pal

     , which
is also a cool "team color" combo, whether intentional or not.

     Ransack GTS is an original,
very well-done repaint that looks fantastic, and looks catches the eye
so much better than the original release of this mold did. One of the best
repaints in the Cybertron line, and on a pretty good mold to boot-- highly
recommended!

       The idea behind the new paint job is
that Ransack GTS is supposed to be a spy. Slip in, do some sabotage, and
slip out again. That was the idea anyway. But the pressure is too intense
for someone as twitchy as Ransack GTS. He's used to racing headlong into
trouble, and then talking his way back out. He may be geared for stealth,
but his over-stocked vocal processor has Galvatron considering just removing
it entirely.
