    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Dirge.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen
Dirge

     Well, here's something
unusual-- a repaint using a Seeker-inspired mold, but one that's wholly
a new character as opposed to-- y'know, one of other Seekers! As good as
homages are, new characters are always appreciated (though sadly from reading
his bio, you really don't get much character from Jetblade, but that's
another story), especially when they have unique color schemes. Jetblade
here certainly fits that bill-- he fits in with the general Decepticon
"cooler colors", but takes in a completely unique direction, albeit one
that's hardly realistic for a jet. The rather flat off-white serves as
the base color, and though it by itself is rather dull, the lighter coloration
helps to bring out all those molded-in details this time around. The white
is accented quite liberally with two very nice shades of light periwinkle
and dark purple. Both of those secondary color serve as excellent contrast
colors, with the the perwinkle being a nice "mediator" color between the
very light off-white and the very dark purple, and particularly in robot
mode makes for a quite beautiful color scheme. There's also plenty of nice
paint apps that also serve to accent the main three colors, like silver,
bronze, and the red bits on the robot mode-- particularly the red looks
awesome against the dark purple. There's also a bit of black plastic that
serves mostly as a "filler" color for the small connector pieces, and is
a nice neutral color to round the whole package out.

     Jetblade has a highly
unique and beautiful color scheme, though it probably will only appeal
to those Transformers fans who don't mind less realistic, more "out there"
color schemes. Another unfortunate knock against Jetblade is, well, the
mold itself, but Hasbro certainly did a nice job "prettying it up" for
this redeco. Recommended a bit over RotF Dirge, but still not generally
recommended overall because of the mold.

       Jetblade has been hiding out for years
among human fighter planes. It was only recently that he hooked up with
Terradive, and the two became instant friends, vowing to remain hidden
until the time was right. Even so, the temptation to catch the slow-moving
Tomahawk out in the open was too much for the two dangerous Decepticons.
