    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Turbo
Tracks. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     Like most of the other
Shattered Glass toys in the main 2012 Botcon "Invasion" boxset, Turbo Tracks
here gets his main color scheme and inspiration from another toy-- namely,
the eHobby toy Road Rage, which was a similar recolor of the original Tracks
toy. The Autobot symbols on Shattered Glass Tracks are also a rather fuchsia
shade of color, allowing one to repurpose him as a "normal" Autobot without
needed to resticker his allegiance symbols, which was a nice thought. Shattered
Tracks' main color scheme is a light red (obviously the opposite of dark
blue!), with black serving as the main foil color in vehicle mode. He has
plenty of paint apps, though, so you don't need to worry about one part
of the toy being too one-tone. All of his windows are painted black, along
with a nifty stripe down the sides. His bumper is painted silver, his taillights
and headlights dull orange, and there's a neat flame decal on his roof,
which is close to Tracks' G1 flame symbol-- certainly closer than the more
stylized flames found on Autobot Alliance Turbo Tracks. In robot mode,
white and a rather nice shade of royal purple make themselves known, and
both look fantastic against both the red and the black-- the purple in
particular. There's also some nice gunmetal gray on his legs to give him
a more metallic look there.

     Shattered Glass Tracks
has a great color scheme even when taken by himself, with numerous paint
apps and a color scheme that really meshes together while both being rather
original and refraining from being too loud. Add in the double homage to
Road Rage, and this toy has my favorite color scheme from the core boxset
for the 2012 figures. Recommended if the cost of an exclusive toy doesn't
bother you.

       MOTTO: "There was once a prophecy that
there would emerge the greatest looking Autobot of all and his name would
be Tracks."

     <i>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Tracks is simply the greatest thing
in the Autobot army, at least that's how he sees it. He dismisses those
who think he is not the best looking Autobot of all time, calling them
a bunch of "haters". If you take enough time to admire his form, you will
eventually learn to appreciate him as much as he appreciates himself. However,
to date, this theory has yet to be proven. One quality no Autobot will
dispute is Tracks' bravery. He is always willing to be one of the first
to charge into battle with the goal of destroying more enemies than anyone
else, all in an effort to prove how utterly amazing he truly is. In vehicle
mode he can achieve a maximum speed of 300 MPH. If he needs to move faster
he can transform into a flying car, allowing him to achieve sub-sonic speeds.
He is armed with two heat-seeking missile launchers and a weapon that disrupts
the energy flow inside enemies causing unpredictable malfunctions, most
commonly the loss of sight. Tracks' greatest weakness is his tendency to
admire himself in a reflection while in the midst of battle, making him
an easy target.
