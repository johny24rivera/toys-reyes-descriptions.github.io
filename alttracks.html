    Tracks is a Chevrolet
Corvette Z06. Again, like it is with all Alternators, this is an excellently
done mode. No robot extras to speak off, adjustable seats, mirrors, and
steeting wheel, detailed interior, rubber tires, openable hood and side
doors, and the like. Pretty much a flawless mode, really, if you ignore
the couple of lines going through the car's structure, necessary for transformation,
that wouldn't be there on a normal car, but that's obviously to be expected.
I especially like the little logos on the front and rear of the car, and
that delicious metallic blue-- it looks like real car metal, it does. Can't
get any better than this, folks.

    In robot mode, Tracks
is still pretty good, but he does suffer from a bit of kibble. The front
and rear windshield on his back just kind of hang there without really
looking like anything, though at least they manage to stay out of the way
some. He also has parts of the front of his car hanging off the back of
his feet, too, and these can get in the knee articulation some. His side
doors do hang off his waist, but unlike his other kibble, these look like
something; namely, a kind of medieval "skirt", similar to that on
    <a href="ridprowl.html">
     RiD
Prowl
    </a>
    . As for his articulation, Tracks' is pretty good; he can move
at the head, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), the wrists,
his index finger, his other four fingers (as a whole), his hips, his knees
(at two points), and his ankles. So pretty much every point except his
waist has excellent movement. His color scheme adds more grey and black
into this mode, whith a bit of silver, white, and red for detailing. It's
not exactly the most original color scheme, but it's certainly not dull,
and works well, especially considering that it's pretty much spot-on like
that of
    <a href="g1tracks.html">
     G1 Tracks
    </a>
    . (As is the head design.)
Tracks also has a feature rare among Alternators, and that is that he can
hold his own in the weapons department. Not only does he have the obligatory
engine-gun (though it looks more like an engine than a gun), but he also
has (non-firing) rocket launchers over his shoulders. Again, this is a
pretty big throwback to his G1 version. However, these launchers are on
somewhat loose joints, at least on mine, so they tend to swivel around
easily-- this can get rather annoying. Tracks also has guns coming out
of his upper arms that resemble exhaust pipes, and they look quite cool.

    Autobot Tracks is a
pretty cool Alternator, with a great color scheme, vehicle mode, articulation,
proportions, and his fair share of weapons. He does suffer a little from
kibble in robot mode, but it's not nearly as bad as, say,

    . Highly recommended.
