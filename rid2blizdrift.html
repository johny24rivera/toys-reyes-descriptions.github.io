not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 warrior

     Every "Blizzard Strike"
redeco of Drift--although certainly arctic-themed-- is different, and that's
the case for his Warrior class version, as well. One of the main plastic
colors for Blizzard Drift is a fairly light icy blue, which is a shade
used on a lot of Blizzard Strike redecoes-- and for good reason, it looks
like what's in those artificial ice packs you use if you sprain an ankle
or something. The other main color is a darker milky blue, which both complements
and contrasts against the lighter blue. Additionally, in robot mode there's
a decent amount of black on the main body-- on the knees, the waist and
abs, and around the shoulders, fists, and elbows. Overall it's a pretty
decent color scheme as far as the plastic colors go, but it's not anything
to write home about. What IS something to write home about are the paint
apps, which really take this redeco up to another level. First, let's get
the boring little bits out of the way so we don't have to talk about them
anymore-- there's some clear plastic used for the windows and a bit of
light milky gray on the upper legs. Both meh, but not used much. But I
LOOOVE the mostly-clear-yet-slightly-translucent plastic on the wheels--
it really looks like the wheels are made of ice. Such a little touch, but
a cool look. There's a similar "icy" shade of off-white paint used on Drift's
kneecaps, which again looks great. There's also some silver "simplified
circuitry-like" line details on the car doors and the robot shoulders.
It looks quite nice against the dark blue, but it doesn't contrast enough
against the lighter blue. There's some gray on the face, along with some
darker blue lining his "helmet" and dark red on his head crest and the
faux head crest and headlights on the front of his car mode. (That said,
the moderately light blue paint used on the top of that front grill piece--
and on the robot toes-- doesn't match closely enough with the light icy
blue plastic behind it. It looks odd.) My favorite color addition of all,
though, is definitely the paint that's used in place of the darker milky
blue when you need paint instead of plastic-- i.e. on the car roof and
on the details on the robot chest. It's a REALLY nice metallic shade of
the color and just looks dynamite. I understand it can't be used over all
the dark blue-colored places on the toy because of the paint budget, but
man... I wish it did. It is just a very eye-catching color.

     The Warrior class version
of Blizzard Strike Drift is an excellent themed redeco of a pretty nice
mold, with not only your basic "arctic"-themed colors, but some nice additions
like silver circuitry lines, wheels that look like they're made of ice,
and especially the metallic dark blue on the robot chest and the car roof.
Out of all the Blizzard Strike redecos of Drift (and there's more of them
than of any other character, for some reason), this is my favorite in terms
of the colors, and my favorite version of this mold.
