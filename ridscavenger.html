    Mold History
   </b>
   : Scavenger's mold was
originally used for the Beast Machines toy of the same name, which came
out back in 2000.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Scavenger.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Scavenger

     Scavenger's new color
scheme is pretty neat, and has a very "arctic" feel to it. The icy off-white
and watery blue go very nicely together to create this effect, as does
the transparent blue. The black and gold go together nicely too, and this
new color scheme definitely makes the older one look like some kind of
prototype. Which is ironic, especially since the older version of Scavenger
had more detailing (on the vehicle mode "neck"). The older green-and-neon-orange
color scheme, although slightly more fitting for a construction vehicle,
is simply a bit harder on the eyes than this softer and more-themed color
scheme. An interesting note, however- in place of Scavenger's old Vehicon
spark crystal is a solid red orb. I would have preferred a new Autobot
spark crystal, as it would have looked better, but Hasbro admitted that
these repaints were rushed a bit to fill out the end of the line. At least
he still has an Autobot symbol on his right tread (although I would have
preferred one on his left one too).

     Scavenger has had no
mold changes from his previous version, so he retains all the positives
and negatives of his predecessor mold-wise.

     Although Scavenger was
a "merely okay" mold for Beast Machines, Hasbro took the color scheme and
improved upon it, making this toy a bit better. Despite its setbacks, Scavenger
is still a pretty good buy, especially since you get him and 2 other BM-basics
for just around $15 U.S.
