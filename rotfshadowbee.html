not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

       Hey, look another Legends
class Bumblebee that's barely been changed. Yay. Compared to the original,
this one has an extra outline around the two main stripes in vehicle mode,
and an Autobot in the middle of the two said stripes. He also has some
rather nifty thinner stripes containing some "Cyberglyphics" on the sides.
It's not all good, though-- the color of the windows has been changed to
a metallic light silvery blue. It's not a bad color-- it's what usually
is used for painted windows on Transformers, after all-- but it doesn't
contrast quite as much with the dull yellow, so it doesn't stick out as
much as the dark blue on the original Rotf Legends Bumblebee did.

           Well, this is certainly
an unusual repaint-- it's a "regular" store release of a character that
had previously only been an
           <a href="shadowstriker.html">
            OTFCC exclusive
           </a>
           !
Yup, Wheelie's repaint is a femme-bot, and it oddly enough works. The head
design is actually surprisingly close with the face painted gold and the
eyes painted red like they are. And the overall figure of the toy, while
not outright feminine, isn't exactly obviously masculine, either-- just
like the original Shadow Striker, too. The overall color scheme of the
toy is pretty eye-catching for a figure this small, particularly in vehicle
mode-- black and red are hardly ever a bad combination for a Decepticon,
and this toy isn't any exception. The WHEELS being red is a bit much, though.
In addition, Shadow Striker is really, really lacking some paint apps in
robot mode-- her head's painted up all nicely, and the headlights on the
abdomen are also painted a nice yellow, but there is ZERO paint on her
arms and legs, making her look a little boring in that mode. Adding just
a little more gold in robot mode-- or perhaps, hearkening back to her original
version, some teal-- would've done some wonders.

             This set,
             <i>
              mold-wise
             </i>
             ,
is definitely the best of the three Target Exclusive N.E.S.T. Global Alliance
two-packs. Both of the included TFs are definitely pretty good Legends
molds, and a Shadow Striker homage from Wheelie is pretty nice and unexpected
while also utilizing a good color scheme. If it was just Shadow Striker
I'd wholeheartedly recommend this set, despite the lack of paint apps in
her robot mode-- however, the set comes with yet ANOTHER hardly-changed
Bumblebee redeco, which pretty much any movie-collecting Transfan has some
version of by this point. In that case, it's a bit hard to essentially
recommend Shadow Striker for $10 unless you are just really a fan of the
character or something. But if you don't have Legends Bumblebee for whatever
reason, then by all means, pick these guys up.
