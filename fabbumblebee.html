    Plasma Punch Bumblebee's
Concept Camaro mode is very good, particularly for a Fast Action Battler.
It's SLIGHTLY kiddy-fied, as it's slightly wider proportionally than it
should be, but it's very, VERY slight to the point where you won't notice
it unless you really look at it. The soles of the robot feet are rather
obvious on the rear end of this mode, but otherwise there's no robot extras
to speak of, and all of the car panels fit together quite well, too. The
small hinge on the front end of the side doors is the only "toyish" looking
part of this mode from a design aspect. Bumblebee also has all the necessary
paint apps you'd expect, including the stripes, painted windows, and a
quite detailed front bumper. (The rear bumper could use another paint app
or two, though, as only the taillights there are painted.) Bumblebee has
the necessary mold detailing as well-- that is, not a lot, as the Camaro
isn't a car with a lot of lines or other details going on it. The yellow
used for FAB Bumblebee looks quite good-- better than on almost all the
other Movie Bumblebee toys in fact, as it has a bit of orange-golden tint
to it, just like on the actual car.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
certainly simplifies his design-- as is appropriate for a toy aimed at
this age range-- but it's still easily recognizable as Bumblebee. Because
of the simplified transformation, his car roof merely hangs off his back,
and the rear third of his vehicle mode forms rather bulky lower legs, with
his upper legs looking really skinny in comparison. Also, his chest is
a bit large, and I don't like how his side doors just fold up against his
main body-- that's the least-accurate aspect of this design, since Movie
Bumblebee's side doors should be mounted on his back like wings, not folded
onto the sides of his chest. His arms actually aren't particularly skinny,
but they do look it compared to Bumblebee's rather massive chest. His face,
while well-detailed, is detailed on the inside of a square piece of plastic,
and having the edges of the square stick out from the sides of his face
looks rather goofy and unnecessary, in my opinion. I realize this makes
the mode seem like it's pretty much all bad, but it's really one of the
better FAB robot modes-- even though his proportions are off a bit, they
aren't off so much that Bumblebee looks goofy, and such proportions are
rather common on more "traditional-style" Transformers anyways. His chest
splits in half to make it slightly more movie-accurate, even though it
doesn't have to in any way for the transformation, a definite plus. Bumblebee
also has rather good articulation for a Fast Action Battler-- he can move
at the shoulders, elbows (at two points), the left wrist, the hips, and
the knees. He also has the same "turn me right at the waist, but then I
spring back" movement that most other FABs have. His shoulder articulation
is rather limited to just front-and-back motion because of its construction,
but other than that he has a pretty good range of motion, and he's not
back-heavy so you can get a fair number of poses from him. The mold detailing
on his robot parts is also very, very good, and his paint detailing is
fair as well. His gimmick is also fairly cool-- his left arm is in its
gun-form on this toy, but instead of being just a straightforward trigger-activated
missile launcher, you rotate the nozzle of Bumblebee's gun to fire the
projectile. (I don't like the color of the projectile, though-- a dull
blue color for plasma? Uh, no.)

    Plasma Punch Bumblebee
is one of the better Fast Action Battlers, with a nice golden shade of
yellow used to fit in with his black, a nearly flawless vehicle mode, and
a decent, if simplified and unoriginal, robot mode design. The perfect
choice for kids who aren't old enough to take on the quite-complicated
