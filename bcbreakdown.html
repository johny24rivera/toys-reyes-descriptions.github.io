not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Sunstreaker.

     Breakdown is the epitome
of the G2 "uber-loud" color schemes... even though he's actually a G1 character
whose original toy was planned to be re-released at retail in G2, but instead
it became an exclusive for the first Botcon at Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1994.
(Hence the license plate, "BCFW94".) As for Breakdown's color scheme, I'll
get right to the point-- it's hideous. Absolutely, mind-blowingly hideous.
And, of course, that's sort of the point of a lot of this set. It's sort
of a kitsch "so bad it's good" kinda thing. Pink and sea foam green with
a little bit of black form his main colors, which are both totally inappropriate
for ANY vehicle, including a sportscar. He's also got other G2-esque paint
apps, with a huge G2 Decepticon symbol on his hood, a really weird "red-dripping-paint-over-blue-with-white-flecks"
paint app on his roof, and his name written on the side of his car mode.
(So much for disguise... well, I guess he went this far with the color
scheme, why not go all the way?) He's got a fair amount of paint apps,
and they did a really good job replicating his G2 color scheme on this
toy (which fits him quite well), but... it's very, very G2. Including the
utterly random brown paint app on his chest.

     Breakdown has a new
head mold, based closely on his original mold's head, but bigger proportionally.
It certainly has that very square feel to it, and it's a very well-done
sculpt. Though of course, there's the colors... He uses the
     <a href="uni2sideswipe.html">

     configuration for robot mode.

     Botcon 2010 Breakdown
is an immediate love-it-or-hate-it figure. I think pretty much everyone
can agree he's hideous, but the question is, is he so hideous it goes right
back around to being good, or is he just hideous? Which camp you fall into
will definitely affect my recommendation or not-- he's certainly not for
everyone.

       Breakdown is kind of a nervous wreck.
Ever since the other Stunticons were put in stasis after a pitched battle
with Defensor, his standing in the Decepticon army has plummeted. He's
afraid that without Menasor, he's nothing, and that the only reason Galvatron
hasn't destroyed him yet is because the Decepticon leader can't remember
who he is. He's journeyed to Earth hoping to track down and eliminate Streetwise,
the last functioning Protectobot. If he can get revenge, he'll have proven
his worth. Clench made Breakdown a forestonite test subject because he
was considered completely disposable. The mutation enhanced Breakdown's
sonic vibration ability, enabling him to focus and project powerful sonic
booms from his robot-mode arms.
