    Beast mode is a rhino,
obviously. (By the way, Rhino has no official name, he is simply called
Rhino.) Rhino's robot legs are very visible in this mode, and subtract
from the overall look of the beast mode. Although the red lining inside
Rhino's front beast mode legs gives away that he's a robot in disguise,
this doesn't look too bad. Not too bad of a beast mode for a McDonald's
toy, but still relatively crummy.

    Robot mode is a big
disappointment, though. This mode looks more like a dumb karate fighter
in a grey suit than a robot in disguise. He has an awkwardly long body,
and his arms are very slim and don't look very nice. His back rhino legs
stick out a bit, and make this robot seem even weirder. His legs and head
are the only decent part of this mode. His legs are each articulated at
the waist, which is rare for a Happy Meal toy, and his head doesn't look
too different from

    Beast mode is okay,
but robot mode is very crummy, even for a Happy Meal toy. Not recommended.
