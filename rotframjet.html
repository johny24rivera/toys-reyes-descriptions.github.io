    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     , Movie Ramjet now gets a bonafide Voyager-class movie
toy! Like the first Movie's FAB, his colors are a definite homage to the
original G1 Ramjet, with white and black being the main colors, with some
dull red wings. He's still a bit different from even the first Movie's
FAB in terms of his color scheme, though as he doesn't have big Decepticon
symbols on his wings and instead more G1-y stripes. I think it all goes
together quite well, particularly in vehicle mode, with the red wings framing
the white "core" of the plane quite well, and the black forming a nice
secondary color as well. In robot mode, more of his brown parts become
apparent, with red taking a back seat-- again, these brown parts go together
fairly well against the surrounding colors, though I think not quite as
well as the dull red wings did in vehicle mode. I also think a slightly
darker shade of brown would've worked better, too, though that's a really
niggling issue.

     RotF Ramjet is a pretty
decent repaint of the Movie 1 Starscream mold, with nice balance of colors
and a good G1 homage. Still, I think some other redecos of this mold, such
as
     <a href="movthundercracker.html">
      Thundercracker
     </a>
     , are done better,
and the inflated price makes him only recommended over the original release
of this mold, even considering he comes with a rather nifty lenticular
card.

       Ramjet isn't terribly smart, but he
is crazy and violent, which is just the way Megatron likes him. Most Decepticons
are pretty grim, going about their dirty business in plodding silence.
Not Ramjet. He begins to cackle madly as soon as the first laser burst
of a battle crackles through the air, and he doesn't stop until the battle
is through. He's known across the galaxy for skipping ranged fighting and
diving directly towards his opponents, hoping to ram them. Most of his
battles end with his enemies driven into the ground, and his head badly
dented.
