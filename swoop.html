    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Terrorsaur. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Beast Wars Terrorsaur

     Before I get onto the
toy review itself, a bit of explanation needs to be given about Swoop/Terranotron's
name. For some unknown reason- most likely copyright issues- about half
of these toys came out with packaging that called it Terranotron, while
the other half called it Swoop. They're still the same toy, though. It
seems that the Swoop variant is the slightly more common one, but they
were both made in about equal amounts. (I got the Terranotron variant,
by the way.) For simplicity's sake, and because it's a better name and
hearkens back to his G1 namesake, I'm just going to call the toy Swoop
for the rest of this review.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Swoop's color scheme
is certainly an improvement over ol' orange-red Terrorsaur's- the gray
and yellow are, of course, a nod to the G1 Dinobots, but orange and purple
are thrown into the mix as well- and mix they do, and quite nicely. I've
always liked the light orange and purple color combination, and I don't
we see it on enough Transformers. Regardless, Swoop looks very nice overall,
even though no new paint apps were added. What I don't like, though, is
the Autobot symbol on his forehead. It looks stupid, just like it does
on all the other Transformers: Dinobots. The two Autobot symbols on his
wings in robot mode are slightly less stupid-looking in their placement,
but only slightly. Insignias shouldn't be tattooed on organic beasts!

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Swoop from his previous incarnations, so he retains all the
features and flaws mold-wise.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Swoop is a good repaint
of Terrorsaur, but the mold remains mediocre at best. Still, since he's
technically free if you purchase Grimlock...
