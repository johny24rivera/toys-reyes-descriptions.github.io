    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior Strongarm
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RID2015 warrior
Strongarm

     Just like his other RID2015
toys, Ratchet is a remold of Strongarm, and thus, logically, his Warrior
version is a remold of Warrior class Strongarm. The most substantial and
transformation-altering remold has to do with the legs; the molding for
the lower robot legs is completely different, with fewer details than Strongarm
overall but more angular ones (the robot feet also aren't separate pieces
this time around). However, the entire top back end is folded into the
lower legs in robot mode, and they fold out above the legs for transformation
to vehicle mode to make the back end of the vehicle mode higher than the
front end, to give the alt mode some needed bulk to make it appropriate
for an ambulance. The "shell" pieces on the back of Ratchet that form most
of the center section of the vehicle mode are also completely new, being
a bit larger that Strongarm's and thus a bit more obviously back kibble--
and unlike with Strongarm, the doors don't "fan out" in a decent manner
on the sides of the robot mode. The mold detailing on these new pieces
is also a bit more sparse, so overall I consider this change a slight negative
compared to Strongarm. The inner shoulder pieces have been slightly remolded
so that the arms don't slide around on the inner shoulders if you try to
pose said shoulders-- the biggest improvement over Strongarm, in my opinion,
because that was rather annoying. The robot chest has also been re-molded
to be the typical RID2015 "faux window" chest, which does the job, but
I think is kinda plain. I wish they had changed it to make the chest details
a bit more like Prime Ratchet, since this IS a new form for him. Of course,
the headsculpt is also new, and looks pretty much directly like
     <a href="priratchet.html">
      Prime
Ratchet
     </a>
     but
     <i>
      slightly
     </i>
     friendlier-- i.e., with a less pointy headcrest.
He looks slightly grumpy, which of course fits the good doctor. The front
chunks of the vehicle mode that fold over the front arms have been changed,
with blockier headlights and a more angular grill. Finally, the weapons
have been changed-- instead of one longer gun, Ratchet comes with two chunky
smaller blasters.

     When it comes to the
color scheme, there's no surprises here. It's classic Ratchet-- red, white,
and black are the main colors, as befits an Autobot and a medical vehicle.
There's some light milky gray plastic on his upper legs and some inner
parts, which is that unfortunately ugly shade but it's not used all that
often, so it's not a huge deal. There's some silver on his face, and some
moderately light blue on his eyes as well. The color variation in his robot
mode is quite good-- with the black on the waist and tires, the black paint
on the chest, the red on his headcrest and toes, and some really nice angular
red stripes on his lower legs that definitely are the highlight of his
paint apps. In vehicle mode, however, the paint breakup is much less impressive.
His front and front-side windows are painted black (though not the rear
or rear-side windows); much of the top of the roof is red, and the front
bumper has a red stripe along the bottom and cheesy yellow-orange on the
headlights. However, the sides in particular feel very un-detailed, and
combined with the minimal mold detailing it looks like it's ALMOST but
not completely finished. The vehicle mode definitely needs a bit more,
like another obvious color or some more intricate paint/mold detailing.

     Compared to Strongarm,
RID2015 warrior Ratchet's good and bad qualities cancel each other out
and he ends up being just as good/bad as Strongarm is. He has a cooler
leg transformation, but less mold detailing; a fixed shoulder issue, but
less impressive paint apps; cooler weapons, but a larger piece of backpack
kibble in robot mode. If you want a version of RID2015 Ratchet I'd definitely
recommend this the most, but it doesn't improve the mold so much as just...
change it.
