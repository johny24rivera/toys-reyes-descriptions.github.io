    Beast mode is an iguana
with dragonfly wings and dragonfly eyes on his back, with a dragonfly tail.
Kind of cool-looking, but sophisticated. The tip of his tail looks weird,
though, because its his head in robot mode. As usual, nice detailing and
color scheme throughout. To activate his action feature, you just push
the knob on top of the dragonfly eyes up and down, activating a "wing-buzzing"
action. Pretty neat.

    Robot mode is kind of
cool, and very organic-looking. His face resembles that of
    <a href="transquito.html">
     Transquitos
    </a>
    ,
including the face with a missile that can shoot out of it. However, this
missle doesnt shoot very far because you have to push it. His tail folds
up to become his head, but connects to his body well. There are a moderate
amount of extras, though, including his front iguana legs and his iguana
neck pieces. His right arm is a claw made from two of his dragonfly wings
and his right hand is a claw with his iguana head on the bottom, making
this arm look odd.

    This is a difficult
figure to transform, so give yourself a good 7 minutes or so the first
few times you transform his guy. A great transformer overall; in my opinion,
the best of the fuzors, although he has a bit of extras in his robot mode.

      An intelligent, brilliantly colored
robot, Sky Shadow is one of the most charismatic and popular of the Predacons.
A good statesman and leader, he acts as one of Megatrons most trusted
counselors. In actuality however, he despises everyone and wants nothing
more than to rule the Predacons with his own, "more imaginative techniques."
He is an expert in concealment and surprise-assault tactics; with reptilian
patience he can lie for days in wait and then suddenly attack with a powerful
turbo-missile, or convert to robot form and overwhelm unexpecting Maximals
with his devastating saw-edged pincer. Powerful wings allow him to hover
over targets, giving him a distinct advantage with targeting accuracy and
in reconnaissance missions.
