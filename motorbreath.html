    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Legends
"G1" Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     "Motorbreath" here is
a definite homage to G1 Motormaster, and was likely only not named such
because of copyright issues. Just as with the G1 toy, black and gray are
the toy's primary colors, though the gray paint on the legs contrasts extremely
well with the black. It's hard for me to say that gray is exactly an "eye-catching"
color, but a duller or more milky color wouldn't have made his legs pop
nearly as much. There's also some silver on the truck bumper, lights, and
the sides of his robot chest too. For purple, Motorbreath has a bit of
a milkier shade on his side gasoline tanks, and his windows and faceplate
are painted a really nice metallic shade of the same color. Yet again,
it contrasts great with the black and gray, and helps make Motorbreath
not look so monochrome. There's also a touch of metallic gold used for
the robot eyes, which looks nice, but doesn't contribute much to the overall
scheme because of how little it's used. That said, I do like using different
colors for tiny one (or two)-off paint apps like these, to give the TF
just that tiny extra color variety beyond his "base" colors.

     Motorbreath has the
same mold changes that the Dollar Store "Generations" of the Autobot Alliance
G1 Legends Optimus mold has-- namely, he comes with a sword that can be
held in either of his hands and can be stored via a small peg hole in the
back of his head (which forms part of the top of his truck cab mode). He
has no mold changes unique to this version, however.

     Generations Motorbreath
is a great little repaint homage to Motormaster, even if not having a new
head hurts him a bit in robot mode. The color scheme of black, purple,
and gray/silver has always looked great, though, and homage or not it still
looks just as great here-- plus he's got plenty of paint apps. The shades
of each are pretty much perfect, so if you at all want this mold but only
want one version, this is the version to get.

       The troops under his command hate Motorbreath,
but they fear him more. The same could be said of many Autobots. This cruel
warrior delights in nothing so much as the tortured screams of an enemy's
chassis being blasted apart by his cannons.
