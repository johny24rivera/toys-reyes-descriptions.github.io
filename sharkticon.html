    Sharkticon's vehicle
mode is certainly unique-- it's in a similar style as
    <a href="enscorponok.html">
     Scorponok's
    </a>
    ,
given that it's a vehicle in the shape of an animal. In this case, a submarine
in the shape of the shark. And it looks quite cool, really. There's four
little rotatable guns on the top and sides; a transparent bridge area on
the top center of this mode that looks very stylized and even has minor
fins on the side; and there are what look like little torpedo launchers
in between the rear fins. Plus, there's LOADS of mechanical and paint detailing
all over Sharkticon, so this is definitely not a dull figure. As for the
color scheme itself, it's quite appropriate; white, bluish black, red,
silver, and yellow give it a bit of a "war-like" feel while still seeming
rather aquatic, and the purple fits in fairly well as well, though I think
perhaps a medium blue would have been a bit better. Admittedly, Sharkticon
does have a few visible robot extras, but they still mesh at least fairly
well with the rest of the mode, and don't stick out like a sore thumb.
For one thing, the robot fists are rather visible on the back end of Sharkticon,
and the robot legs are on the bottom of this mode (the bottom fins stick
out of the sides of them), but again, both mesh very well with the overall
shape of the mode, so minimal points are deducted for that.

    Like other Energon Decepticons,
Sharkticon has a "hyper mode". Like most other hyper modes, it's nothing
much-- just the sides of the mode opening up to reveal two missile launchers--
but it does look fairly cool, and it's kind of a neat idea that half of
the entire toy splits apart to reveal more weapons. A neat little gimmick.

    Sharkticon's robot mode
is also very good, with nice proportions, colors, and detailing. It also
has a very unique look to it- it's curved and stylized at some points,
while being sharp and angular at others. It all comes together very well.
The robot head looks especially orignal- he's got a large, sloping, angular
forehead over a black faceplate and blue optics. It actually looks somewhat
like X-Men: Evolution
    <a href="magneto.html">
     Magneto's
    </a>
    face-- definitely
evil. Some may be worried about the fact that a third of the vehicle mode
is on Sharkticon's back, but don't be- it doesn't affect his stability,
it doesn't get in the way of articulation much, and the hyper mode missile
launchers can be deployed under his shoulders anyway to give Sharkticon
some firepower. Speaking of articulation, Sharkticon has quite a lot of
it; he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points), elbows, waist,
hips (at two points), knees, and ankles. And the joints are nice and tight.
So pose him all you like, folks. Oh, and of course, Sharkticon's Decepticon
spark crystal is in the center of his chest in this mode.

    Sharkticon is a great
toy in both modes, and has a great color scheme, hyper mode, proportions,
and paint detailing. He does have a few visible robot extras in vehicle
mode, but it's not that big of a deal at all. Ties with
    <a href="slugslinger.html">

    for the best Energon deluxe as of this writing (10/04). (Although admittedly,
Slugslinger would have pulled ahead slightly if he was more stable.)

      Sharkticon has an appetite for destruction
along with a repulsive stench. Recruited by Scorponok for space reconnaissance,
this evil Decepticon proved very quickly that his true skills were best
displayed during space battle and underwater combat. His powerful jaws
are his greatest weapons. His cruel way of destroying an enemy has been
known to sicken his Decepticon allies, including Megatron, on many occasions.
Even his teammate, Shockwave, is repulsed by Sharkticon's personality and
stink. In vehicle mode, he can out-maneuver some of Optimus Prime's most
skilled Autobots. In robot mode, he takes down the enemy with merciless
precision and pure enjoyment.
