    Beast mode is a transmetal
rhino. This mode is very nicely done, one of the best transmetal beast
modes I've seen. The detailing is excellent, and this mode suffers from
neither underbelly extras or bad proportions. The only proportion complaint
I have, and this is relatively minor, is that the front legs are a little
longer than the back legs, as seen in the beast mode picture above, so
you have to slant the front legs forward a little to get him to stand evenly.
Another problem is that the vehicle treads stick out a bit on the back
of the front feet, and get annoying when you are trying to pose Rhinox.
It would have been much easier, and better-looking, if Rhinox's feet were
made a little longer and tread details were molded onto the bottom of the
feet. While the transmetal light green is fitting for Rhinox, I don't think
the sky blue is. Thus, I prefer the old

    Vehicle mode is a rhino-tank.
This mode looks pretty nice for a transmetal vehicle mode. Sadly, however,
the treads don't roll. Be careful when transforming Rhinox from this mode
to his beast mode, though; you can hurt your fingers while trying to get
out the lower part of the rhino legs from inside the back treads.

    Robot mode isn't quite
as good as the rhino and vehicle modes, but is still pretty nice, with
not too many extras. The only major extras are the rhino parts "backpack",
(this doesn't get in the way much) and the rhino sides extras (these do).
Another minor extra is the rhino face backing on the robot shoulders, and
while this doesn't get in the way, it looks a little odd. The detailing
in this mode definitely resembles the "organic robot mode" that Transmetals
have. Scaly rhino skin detailing is very nice on the body, head, shoulders,
the insides of the upper legs, and the arms. I don't like the way Rhinox's
face is detailied, though. It makes him look like a beefy, battle-addicted
berserker, but Rhinox (at least on the TV show) is more on the calm, intelligent
side. I like the way the sword is done, though- it's made from Rhinox's
rhino horn.Â  Rhinox's "spark chip" that you rub to reveal his allegiance
is located under his chest panels in this mode.

    A very nice toy- although
the color scheme isn't quite as fitting as the original Rhinox Transmetal's
was, the joints move a little better and more smoothly. However, I still
recommend the original Rhinox Transmetal over this one, if you can find
it.
