    Bumper Battler Soundwave's
vehicle mode proportions are slightly altered from that of his
    <a href="anisoundwave.html">
     mainline
toy's
    </a>
    , though not in the more "chibi-ish" way that you'd expect-- after
all, Soundwave's mainline toy is already squat enough. For the Bumper Battler,
the bumper is significantly larger and the back end comes more to a "point"
instead of being rounded off. Minor, to be sure, but still worth noting.
The color scheme works quite well, though it's worth noting that Soundwave's
blue is slightly lighter on the Bumper Battler than on the mainline toy.
The electric greenish blue still works magnificently as an accent color,
though, and like most Bumper Battlers, Soundwave has plenty of paint detailing
to go around this time. He has all the details that his deluxe had, plus
some extra stuff, like the "volume bar-like" detailing on the rear end
is now painted black-and-electric-blue. The "play buttons" detailing on
the front bumper is now an interesting shade of orange, which actually
works very well with the overall color scheme. I also like the style of
Soundwave's name emblazoned near the rear of his vehicle mode-- it has
a volume bar-like detail behind it, and the haphazard style of the lettering
makes it look like they're being "rocked" from music. Very cool. As you'd
expect from an Animated toy, though-- particularly a Bumper Battler-- the
mold detailing is fairly sparse. Like all Bumper Battlers, pressing down
on the Decepticon symbol on his hood will activate anywhere from 1-4 sequential
sound effects which are played out in a semi-randomized manner. It's pretty
cool how many different ordered sound effects you can get out of the toy,
and they're never played in a manner that doesn't make any sense-- and
yes, the show voice actor does Soundwave's voice on the toy. Pressing in
on the front bumper of his vehicle mode will automatically transform him
to robot mode and also play some of these random sound effects. Here's
a list of all the different sound effects I got out of Bumper Battler Soundwave
after a couple dozen button presses (though again, with the vast number
of different random ordering of sound effects he has, I may have missed
a few):

    Like all Bumper Battlers,
Soundwave's "robot mode" is just his upper body poking out of his vehicle
mode, but the robot mode is more of a gimmick than an actual focus of these
toys anyways. Regardless, the mold and paint detailing on his robot parts
is very well-done with pretty much everything painted that needs to be--
his face, shoulder-speakers, the backside of his hands, and his chest,
waist, and even the upper legs are all painted. I'm not fond of the odd
ugly dull goldish green color used for his faceplate and part of his chest,
though, as opposed to the more metallic gold color that was used on the
mainline toy. Unlike some of the other Bumper Battlers, due to the boxy
shape of the top half of the vehicle mode that Soundwave's robot mode detailing
fits in and Soundwave's boxy robot parts, it doesn't look his robot mode
is "squeezed in there", which is certainly a good thing. What's NOT a good
thing is that his robot parts can't move at all-- the norm for Bumper Battlers,
but still a bit disappointing. Also like all Bumper Battlers, Soundwave
has a rather unsightly gap below his robot mode parts that is bereft of
paint and you're honestly supposed to ignore. However, the mold detailing
used in this area is quite good, with things like volume bars and guitar
strings molded into that area. Part of it even looks like Laserbeak molded
flat into his car mode. Odd...

    Bumper Battler Soundwave
is one of the best of the sub-line, with a great color scheme and great
paint detailing. His robot mode detailing is also quite good, and his sound
effects are great. If you know a kid who's too young to get the mainline
toy, this is a nice substitute.
