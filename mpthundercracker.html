    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Masterpiece Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Masterpiece

     Although you think he
would be, Masterpiece Thundercracker is not, in fact, a straight repaint
of Masterpiece Starscream. In fact, he's the first stateside release of
the "new and improved" mold for the Masterpiece Seekers. It's not an
     <i>
      entirely
     </i>
     new mold-- the general transformation, jet proportions, and articulation
remain the same, as do a good number of the pieces-- but several changes
have been made to it to make it a bit more cartoon-accurate in robot mode.
The biggest one is that the tailfins no longer hang on a long piece behind
the hips-- now they simply slide down and stay on the sides of the lower
legs. This looks considerably better than having those big unsightly pieces
on the hips. The feet have also been made a bit more square, with there
being actual heel pieces now (they flip out of where the "engine detailing"
panels used to be). The upper arms and jet intakes have also been redone
to make the transformation slightly easier and remove those odd little
intake pieces that used to be above the shoulders in robot mode at an odd
position. The shoulders are also more square-- a positive look in robot
mode, but in vehicle mode it makes them stick out slightly more obviously.
The weapons are also now attached to the arms via ball joints, a change
which I find rather annoying and puzzling, as it actually lessens the number
of areas where they can be used while adding another piece to the assembly.
The head has been changed for the better, however-- there's no more "face
swapping" gimmick, but the head has been widened slightly so that it's
larger proportionally and better-looking overall (the sides of the head
collapse inwards during transformation-- that's how this was able to be
accomplished). The side waist pieces which form the place for the jet mode
to tab into its stand have also been slightly modified, which make them
look slightly better in robot mode but unfortunately make it so that the
mold doesn't stay on its stand nearly as solidly in jet mode-- a relatively
big negative, in my opinion.

     As for Masterpiece Thundercracker's
colors, you likely know Thundercracker's basic color scheme by this point--
dark blue with black, light gray/silver, and red &amp; white stripes. That
certainly doesn't change here, though the paint apps contrast against each
other particularly nicely on this version. The shade of dark blue is particularly
eye-catching, having just a touch of a metallic look to it. The only part
of the color scheme I'm not entirely enarmored with is the light milky
gray bits (mostly visible in robot mode), which I would've preferred to
have been painted silver or at least have a more metallic shade to it.
Thundercracker also has several tongue-in-cheek nods to various other aspects
of Transformers and G1. This includes a silouhette of Thundercracker holding
Soundwave in cassette player mode painted on his tailfins, along with the
word "SONIC BOOM" written next to it; pictures of G1 Reflector's camera
mode on the sides of his robot mode shoulders; paint apps on the backside
of his vents that very closely mirror his
     <a href="g1thundercracker.html">

toy's sticker details
     </a>
     there; the name "LTC JOE BIG DADDY KYDE" under
the right side of the cockpit, both a nod to the Hasbro employee in charge
of many of the TF exclusives at that time, as well as an oddly-named G1
Micromaster; and the name "CPT J. DRAGON SASS" under the left side of the
cockpit, another Hasbro designer.

     Masterpiece Thundercracker
has the nice color scheme you'd expect from a G1-esque Thundercracker toy,
along with some nice obscure homages here and there (even if some of them,
like the Reflectors on the shoulders, seem a bit out-of-place). The changes
to the mold vary between good and bad, with the "good" being the tailfins
now attached to the lower legs and the better-proportioned head, while
the "bad" involve how his guns are oddly connected to his arms by ball
joints as well as the less sturdy connection his jet mode has to the stand
he comes with. Overall I think the revamped mold is a
     <i>
      slight
     </i>
     net
gain, and it's already a fantastic mold, so this is a highly recommended
purchase.

       Thundercracker looks down on those who
cannot fly with sneering disdain, often going out of his way to attack
creatures that cannot fly, just to prove his superiority. It was this attitude
that led to him being recruited into the original Seekers squadron alongside
Starscream and Skywarp. Though his loyalty to the Decepticon cause is less
than total, the fact that he is allowed to indulge his impulse to assault
those he considers inferior keeps him flying for Megatron.
