     This is less of a repaint
than most Hasbro recolors, to the extent that none of Rampage's paint apps
have been changed from his intial yellow-colored deluxe release. That's
honestly a bit of a disappointment, but understandable given the purpose
of this redeco-- to give Rampage the accurate colors he had in the movie.
Orangish red looks considerably better on this toy than the yellow did,
though admittedly that may be my "anti-yellow bias" seeping in. It's still
a realistic color scheme for a construction vehicle though, but contrasts
with colors like the silver better. The transparent red has been changed
to a rather nice-looking transparent purple, though to be honest the red
was probably more fitting for Rampage. The light gray from the original
Rampage has been changed to a darker shade, which looks considerably better,
and the black has been changed to a really nice-looking metallic gunmetal
gray that definitely catches the eye.

     No mold changes have
been made to RotF red Rampage.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     RotF red Rampage is
definitely what the toy should've been released as in the first place,
but it's nice to see Hasbro rectify that mistake with this redeco. All
of the color changes-- except perhaps the bit of transparent purple plastic--
are for the better. However, with no change in the paint app layout, it
means that particularly in robot mode there are large areas of plastic
that's only one color. Although better than the initial yellow version,
if you're going to get one version of this mold I'd recommend the version
released in the Toys "R" Us-exclusive giftset, as that takes the same colors
but adds more variety and paint apps. (Plus that version's easier to find,
too.)

       Rampage lives for fights like this one.
As he and Bumblebee circle each other, scanning for any advantage, he grins
at the thought of the violence to come. He's heard stories of the Autobot
warrior's skill, and he looks forward to testing himself against it. Already,
he can imagine his whips tearing his enemy's armor to pieces.
