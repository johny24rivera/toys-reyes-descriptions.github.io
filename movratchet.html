     Ratchet's H2 Hummer ambulance mode looks very nice and authentic, especially
for a $20 toy. The proportions are spot-on accurate when compared to the
real thing, and all of the major details are there, such as the "heartbeat
surge" symbol along the side of the ambulance to the small "SEARCH &amp;
RESCUE-- FIRE DEPT" emblem on the side of his doors. With the exception
of part of the robot arms peaking out ever-so-slightly from the underside
of this mode if you look at it from a side view, there's no robot extras
whatsoever, not even any extras visible through the transparent windows
(though there isn't an actual drivers' seat or anything molded inside,
either). The mold detailing is also fairly good. There's only one real
beef I have with this mode, and that's the color scheme. I realize that
some real ambulances really are mostly black and yellowish pea-green in
color, but it just is not a good main color for a Transformer, especially
since besides the standard color of black there's no other major colors
on Ratchet. Also, the painted doors definitely look "off" and more yellowish
when compared to the dull pea green plastic used for the rest of the vehicle
mode.

     Like the mainline version of
     <a href="movjazz.html">
      Jazz
     </a>
     , Ratchet's
robot mode is slightly misproportioned to the extent that his legs seem
a bit too big compared to the rest of his body. Otherwise, though, his
proportions in this mode are pretty good, and the vehicle kibble is taken
care of very well-- the doors fold up behind his shoulders very well to
the point where they don't get in the way of movement at all. However,
though they fold behind the lower back and out of the way pretty well,
I do worry about the transparent window halves snapping because they're
so skinny and flat and sticking out of said lower back a bit-- both that
and another piece on Ratchet's upper back don't really peg into anything
either, which makes that portion of the figure feel a bit "unfinished".Â 
The rear bumper parts on the back of his upper legs can also snap off a
bit too easily, though they can be pegged back on the figure easily enough.
Ratchet's articulation is pretty good-- he can move at the head,k shoulders
(at two places) elbows (at two places), hips, knees (at three places),
and a little bit of ankle movement as well. The mold detailing on the robot
parts is exceptional, especially on the head and the sides of the legs--
however, Ratchet's head design is one of the (very) few movie head designs
I'm not fond of, as I think it looks rather ugly, so even though it's detailed
well both when it comes to the mold and the paint, I don't consider that
much of a plus. As for Ratchet's gimmicks, his right hand can flip around
to become a miniature axe, though the fact that only one side of the axe
is painted makes it look rather cheap, in my opinion. His other arm can
hold the vehicle's rear rack, which doubles as a capture claw weapon, though
the claw feels a bit loose in that it can open and close rather easily.
Ratchet also has an "automorph" feature as you transform him, though it's
pretty subtle and kind of pointless-- as you fold out his feet, his knees
and the insides of his lower legs fold out just a little, and that's it--
honestly, they really don't add much to the figure at all, and the money
spend on those parts would have been better spent elsewhere on the figure.

     Autobot Ratchet is a fine addition to the movie line-- he's not an AMAZING
figure, mainly due to his rather ugly color scheme, a few minor kibble
problems in robot mode, and some lame action features-- but he's still
a cool toy nonetheless. Recommended.

       Autobot Ratchet
is devoted to saving life, no matter what form it takes, and no matter
whose it is. Every Autobot has had his Spark preserved at least once by
him, and more than one Decepticon has opened his optical sensors after
a mortal blow only to find Autobot Ratchet welding shut the final incision.
He joined up with Optimus Prime not because he wanted to be a soldier,
but because he believed the Autobots presented the last, best hope of preserving
life in the universe against the evil of the Decepticons.

       *NOTE: In addition to the normal mainline release,
pictured above, a version of this mold was released with all-metallic paint--
but with the same colors-- as a Best Buy exclusive. With the exception
of it being more shiny, however, that version is for all intents and purposes
the same as this version.
