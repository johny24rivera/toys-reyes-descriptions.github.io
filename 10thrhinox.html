    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Rhinox. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     10th Anniversary Rhinox's
overall color layout is the same as the toy's original version, but the
tones of most of the colors have changed. The brown used for the rhino
mode is of a decidedly darker, duller, more "fleshy-like" tone, and there's
a really nice new semi-metallic bronish brown fade on the back and the
front of the legs of the rhino mode. The green used for Rhinox's robot
parts is also a bit darker of a shade. (The gold and black seem to be largely
the same shade as the original, however.) 10th Anniversary Rhinox does
have a few different paint apps-- for one, the rhino eyes are actually
painted white with pupils this time, as opposed to the more evil-looking
solid red of the original. There's also a silver-and-red Maximal symbol
painted on the right rhino shoulder. In addition, some of the paint apps
on the robot head has been changed to make the color layout more show-accurate
(and all-around better-looking), and a black stripe paint app on the Mutant
head has also been added.

     No mold changes have
been made to 10th Anniversary Rhinox, though he does have an assembly error;
his shoulders and upper arms have been assembled backwards. It's an easy
fix, however-- just unscrew the screws on the shoulders, flip some of the
parts around so they look right, then re-screw the shoulders back together
again.

     10th Anniversary Rhinox
has a much more show-accurate color scheme than the original, and I love
the new, more fleshy tones to to the rhino mode, plus the new robot head
paint apps. It's still not different enough where I'd recommend it if you
have the original Rhinox, however. Although this toy does have some pretty
good nostalgia value, it's not that good of an actual Transformer when
compared to today's standards especially, so if you don't have a particular
attachment to Beast Wars, you're probably better off picking up one of
the better-designed

       Maximal second-in-command and chief
science officer, Rhinox prefers to remain aboard the Axalon to engaging
in battle, but that doesn't mean he can't fight. On the contrary, his triple-plated
steel skin and wide array of medium range and hand-to-hand weapons make
him dangerous to even the toughest opponent. There's a good reason Rhinox
is the last line of Maximal defense, after the perimeter is breached and
all weapons systems are offline - no one's ever got past him.
