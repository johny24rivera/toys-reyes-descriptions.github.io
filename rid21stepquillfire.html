    Quillfire's alternate
mode is a bulky SUV-- in fact, on the show the model looks almost identical
to

    , but brown. Most of
the major details are here on this 1-step changer version of the character,
but the whole vehicle mode appears "squished" a bit from the top, as it's
too wide compared to its height here. It's a bit of an odd look, with everything
squashed and stretched on something that otherwise has fairly realistic
mold details, with stuff like side doors, a front grill w/ headlights and
a winch, and detailing on the wheels that fits a 4WD vehicle. There's another
big issue with this mode, and that's that there's the robot feet just sticking
out VERY obviously from the back end. There's not even an attempt to hide
them, really. Plus, there isn't really a back end at all to this mode in
terms of having an actual solid back bumper-- between the feet, there's
little bits sticking out there that become Quillfire's quills in robot
mode. It just looks bad back there, which is unfortunate on top of the
squashed proportions in this mode. The color scheme is decent enough--
it's pretty basic, being mostly a fairly dark milky brown and black, but
it works. There's some metallic charcoal black on the windows and robot
feet. As with most usages of this color I think a more "pure" glossy black
would've worked better, but it's not bad. There's also some silver on the
front grill and light orange on the headlights. Unfortunately there's no
other paint in this mode, but then again the color breakup is fairly good
overall, even if part of that is just because the back area is part of
the robot mode. The winch on the front is the only detail that really begs
for paint that doesn't have some, in my opinion.

    To transform Quillfire
to robot mode, you take the legs and fold them down, and the rest of the
toy auto-transforms as a result. You can then fold forward the arms from
the vehicle halves, and there you go. The end result is... mixed. The legs
are a bit overly simplified in their detailing-- I mean, the upper legs
are barely more than polygons, honestly-- but they're pretty decentÂ 
proportionally, and at least those bit honkin' feet that stick out in vehicle
mode keep Quillfire nice and stable in this mode. The arms themselves also
look pretty decent, with claw-like fingers molded in, though the faux car
doors on the lower arms are laughably small, especially since the REAL
car doors are right above them. And there's the rub for this mode-- I mean,
the entire side halves of the vehicle mode just splay off the shoulders.
No attempt to fold them up or out of the way at all, they're just... there.
The front portion of the alt mode makes up the back of Quillfire's main
body, but this is fairly minor overall and you can only really tell from
a rear-oriented view. Quillfire's head itself is pretty well-sculpted,
with a fierce-looking toothy jaw and face, with red on the eyes and silver
on the lower jaw. (Sadly, these are the only new paint apps visible in
this mode.) I love the multiple different levels of spikes on his upper
back which give Quillfire his name. However, the overall body just isn't
bulky enough to really look right-- Quillfire's not a slim guy, and yet
from this toy you'd think he has a long "underbelly" chest and is just
a big skinny hunchback. (He IS a bit of a hunchback on the show, but because
of all the spikes-- not because of his posture.) For articulation in this
mode, the arms can move back-and-forth at the shoulders, but that's it.
Though again, if you're buying 1-step changers for articulation, you are
buying the wroooong size class, pal.

    Quillfire has a few
interesting ideas and bright spots-- such as the color breakup in vehicle
mode, the well-done sculpt on the head and spikes in robot mode, and just
the overall idea of a SUV becoming a humanoid porcupine-- but the downsides
are pretty hard to overlook. The generally overly simplistic mold details
and lack of paint in robot mode; the entire sides of the vehicle mode hanging
off his shoulders; the mis-proportioned body; the squished alt-mode; and
the obvious feet in the alt mode are all fairly significant downsides.
If you want the character and aren't a completist, I'd get the Warrior
class version instead, unless you're buying it for a fan so young you're
absolutely CERTAIN a 1-step is about as much difficulty as they can handle.
