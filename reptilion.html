    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Iguanus Transmetal 2. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Iguanus Transmetal 2

     This mold has a pretty
nice color scheme, for the most part. The gold and purplish deep brown
mix together nicely to create an almost "I'm bronzed" look to Reptilion.
Like most of the beast Universe figures, though, what really stands out
is the "Energon radiation" pattern- that purple and silver streak on his
fins and leg look so. Freakin'. COOL. The gold and green are also on his
fins, and look well in conglomeration with it as well. The only thing I
do not like about Reptilion is his bright pea green. Even though green
is certainly an appropriate color for a reptilian Transformer, it's TOO
bright. At least two or three shades darker would have been easier on the
eyes, and would have meshed together with the other colors a bit better
as well. Plus, considering that none of the pea green parts have any paint
apps on them while the other parts are full of them makes it look like
Reptilion is part finished Transformer, part mismatched prototype. Odd.

     Reptilion is a really
great mold with a very cool color scheme- but the pea green partially ruins
the look it was going for. As such, I like Iguanus Transmetal 2's blue-and-orange
color scheme slightly (and I reiterate
     <i>
      slightly
     </i>
     ) better. If only
that green wasn't so bright, it could've been better than its predecessor...

       With the appearance of a mad scientist's
evil experiment and an intellect on par with the Autobot professor, Perceptor,
Reptilion is the longest serving general under the influence of the monster
planet, Unicron. Reptilion was snatched away from a routine exploratory
mission and forced to work on the dark god's decimated planetary propulsion
systems. His skills in propulsion technology were without peer and was
oftentimes seen hard at work at developing more efficient forms of travel
using warp gate technologies. In battle, he is able to use his experience
and mathematical abilities to predict projectile trajectories, detonation
constants, and simulate a variety of other combat calculations. Armed with
long range tactical missiles capable of carrying a wide variety of warheads.
Able to accurately calculate a target's position from thousands of kilometers
away. Special vanadium armor plating withstands even the most severe blasts.
It is particularly ironic that this once noted scholar has been corrupted
by the influence of evil and uses his brilliant mind to subjugate the universe
for his master.
