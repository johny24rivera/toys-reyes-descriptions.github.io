    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Sideswipe. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RotF Legends class Sideswipe

     Bluesteel Sideswipe is
another slight redeco that's more of an excuse to keep the character on
the shelves without outright keeping him the same. The basic look of him
is the same as on the original Legends class Sideswipe, but the core light
gray plastic has a slightly more bluish tone to it. It's not outright BLUE,
it's just slightly more tinted that way. It's honestly not even particularly
noticeable unless you set him next to the initial Legends class version.
The vehicle mode also looks a bit different-- the windows are now painted
metallic silver instead of blue, and there's a silver "fade" paint app
near the front of said mode. They're both good colors, but honestly they're
so close to the light bluish gray that don't provide much contrast or interest
to the mode. Two other-- considerably more minor-- changes to Bluesteel
Sideswipe's paint job in robot mode are that the paint app in the middle
of his stomach in robot mode is red instead of black, and his Autobot symbol
is on his crotch instead of his chest now. Otherwise he's the same.

     Bluesteel Sideswipe
is a decent pickup if you can't find a previous version of this mold and
are a fan of the Legends class figures, but otherwise don't bother. The
changes are far too minimal for someone who already has the original to
purchase him again, and the few changes that are here make him slightly
LESS interesting.
