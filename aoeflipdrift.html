    Drift's alternate mode
is a Bugatti Veyron, which MOSTLY makes the transition to the "Flip 'n
Change" subline pretty well, with fairly spot-on proportions. However,
one major detail is missing; this version lacks the spoiler in the back
that the other toys of him have. It's still passable, as not all Veyrons
have this spoiler, but it's a notable absence. There are almost no robot
extras in this mode-- like other car "Flip 'n Change" toys, though, he
does have rather noticeable rectangular bits hanging out pretty obviously
in front of his car doors, which is required for the gimmick. UNLIKE the
    <a href="aoeflipbee.html">

    , however, mine doesn't have the "hood and
part of the front hovering slightly above the rest of the car" problem--
luck, or something different about the weight distribution? I don't know,
but I'm certainly not complaining. The mold detailing in this mode is fairly
minimal, given how sleek the Veyron is, but it's detailed where it needs
to be, such as on the wheels and the gas cap. The colors picked for this
toy are what stand out the most, though-- Drift has a REALLY nice shade
of milky semi-metallic blue that makes up most of his plastic in this mode,
and it's quite an eye-catching shade. What makes it even better is the
metallic aquamarine going along the bottom sides of this mode-- which both
contrast and complement the dark blue quite well, though making them a
shade or two lighter would've helped the contrast even more-- and the silver
paint used for the windows, taillights, headlights, and gas cap, which
helps bring a bit more variety of color to the Veyron. The black wheels
and grill-- as well as the dark red Bugatti logo on the front grill and
the Autobot symbol-- are there, but not in really enough of an amount to
contribute to the overall scheme much.

    Drift's transformation
and general positives/negatives with his robot mode are very much like
the
    <a href="aoefliplockdown.html">
     other Flip 'n Change car formers
    </a>
    ,
so I'll go over them in an abbreviated version here. To transform him,
you pull him apart at the back of the car mode and fold the sides out to
form the arms, then flip the entire rest of the toy around those arms a
few times either forward or backward (depending upon which way you're transforming
him), and the toy basically transforms itself, with you only needing to
slide in the shoulders a bit to finish the job. In robot mode, the lack
of articulation is probably the biggest issue, with only movement at the
shoulders (at four points; one of them is shared between both shoulders,
meaning if you move one shoulder up and forward the other will follow due
to the gimmick), elbows, and a little at the wrists. No leg or head movement
whatsoever. I get it with the legs given the transformation, but not even
head rotation? C'mon, Hasbro. The kibble is the second-biggest issue with
the mode, with basically the entire top of the car just hanging behind
Drift's back. Most of it is fairly far back, making him a bit back-heavy,
but his feet are long enough to keep him standing straight. Also with Drift,
the designers were able to give him fake (i.e., molded-in) "swords" in
front of his hood kibble behind his head, which makes the vehicle bits
a bit more acceptable. The third downside are the proportions-- from the
front his arms are too skinny, and from the side his legs are waay too
two-dimensional and flat. (The shoulders formed from the car doors aren't
accurate to his on-screen design, but that's a small quibble.) As for Drift-specific
comments, the mold detailing on his chest and legs are EXTREMELY well-done
with tons of armor paneling, robot bits, and the like molded into those
bits, making them fairly accurate at least in this respect, and really
playing up the "armored samurai" aspect of his character. The chest is
a bit too flat and sloped for my liking, though, and there's a rather obvious
gap in between the bottom of his "neck piece" and the hole for it in the
chest, which is a bit annoying. The actual sculpting for his head is quite
nice, but-- again-- they made Drift's happy face the wrong color! It's
supposed to be gold, not silver! Ugh. As far as colors go, there's a lot
more of that nice aquamarine paint in this mode along his chest, legs,
and fists, and a fair amount of light sky blue plastic on his upper arms,
shoulders, and rear "sword" piece. There is a bit of ugly off-white plastic
used for some of his gears, though, which I'm not a fan of. Couldn't they
have made it a more fitting color? Another thing I'm not fond of in this
mode is the prevalence of a rather dark greenish gray on the legs, inner
arms, and top of the chest. It's a color rather reminiscent of some of
Lockdown's toys, and just doesn't look all that great against all the blue.
More black would've worked much better and given greater contrast. (That
said, it's better than the light gray used on some of Drift's

    Flip 'n Change Drift
is my favorite carformer toy of the subline, and also my favorite "simplfied"
toy of the AoE design. He's got some generally excellent colors, the blues
in particular, and looks absolutely fabulous in car mode (missing spoiler
side). His robot mode does certainly have some issues like odd proportions
and a lack of articulation, but so do the other Flip 'n Change car toys
in the line, and such an awesome gimmick partially overcomes some of these
flaws, in my view. He-- at least, mine-- doesn't have the "slightly hovering
hood" issue in car mode that the other car Flip 'n Changers do, either.
Mildly recommended if you're into the gimmick, even though
