    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF deluxe
Arcee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Like the other toys in
the deluxe "Cyberglyph" assortment exclusive to Target, Arcee's main color
is a rather eye-catching translucent shade of her normal main color-- in
this case, a rosy reddish pink. Even ignoring everything else about Arcee's
color scheme, this is a GORGEOUS shade of the color-- and this is coming
from someone who doesn't even tend to like pink! It makes her look like
she's almost glowing with power. Her other main colors of milky gray and
black are considerably more plain, but for the purposes of this color scheme,
they serve their purpose, bringing some dark and neutral colors to an otherwise
light color scheme. The milky gray is also of a semi-glossy shade, and
looks better than most gray plastic on TFs. The addition of white-- both
on Arcee's side car, stripes on her sides, and on a few other minor parts
on her chest-- really pops against the translucent pink nicely, along with
the translucent light blue used for Arcee's eyes, headlights, and windshield.
On Arcee's translucent pink plastic, there's a slightly lighter, duller
shade of pink that's used for an Autobot symbol and the "Cyberglyph" paint
apps that adorn all the toys from this assortment. It looks quite good
as a complementary color-- not being completely obvious from a first look,
but sticking out just enough where you can make them out-- it's a cool
effect. (The only bit of pink I don't like on Arcee is that paint used
for the piece around the front wheel-- it's noticeably lighter and glossier
than the rest, and doesn't complement the other shades of pink in an attractive
manner, looking out-of-place instead.) There's also a bit of bronze and
silver on her wheel hubs, which help add a bit more color there, though
they don't stick out as fantastically as Arcee's other minor colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Cyberglyph Arcee, though at least on mine a few ball joints
are a bit looser than on the previous versions, likely due to mold degradation.
It doesn't ruin the figure by any means, but it is significant enough to
worth mentioning.

     Cyberglyph Arcee is
a fantastic redeco-- the translucent reddish pink and white in particular,
though none of the colors or paint apps on her (save some of the more solid
pink paint) look at all bad or out-of-place. This is a real attention-grabber
of a color scheme, and is the version of this mold I'd easily recommend
the most, the colors themselves pushing the mold itself up from "mediocre"
to "good", which rarely happens.

       Arcee isn't superstitious, but she's
willing to give anything that might grant her an edge in battle a try.
The ancient tradition of inscribing her home world's language on her armor
gives her a boost in confidence, if not power, and makes her Decepticon
enemies think twice before engaging her directly.
