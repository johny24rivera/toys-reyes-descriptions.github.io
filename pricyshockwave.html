     voyager
class toy,
    </a>
    the commander class version of Shockwave is a futuristic
tank thing, not really resembling any vehicle on Earth and more or less
a byproduct of his robot mode. As messy as his voyager-class toy's vehicle
mode was, the larger toy had a few extra steps that helped connect things
together and helped make most of the tank mode feel a bit more "solid".
This toy, however, doesn't have this; Shockwave's tank mode this time around
is very much NOT a solid toy, with the joints moving quite easily and many
pieces not feeling quite like they're locked in where they should be--
the sides of the tank body and the leg-front sections are particularly
bad at this. The front "window" made from his robot chest doesn't lock
into the upper legs/waist at all, and the sections of his chest that fold
down to make room for the arm-gun to fold onto the top of the tank mode
also don't really lock in anywhere and look out-of-place in this mode.
Other than the small treads on the back and the large cannon on top (which
has a push-missile launcher on it), there really isn't any part of this
mode that looks more like a tank than part of his robot mode; his left
arm is very blatantly sticking out below the main body of the tank, the
front sections are obviously his legs and feet, the main body is obviously
his chest and waist, etc. It's just a very haphazard mode. However, on
the plus side the colors used for this version of Prime Shockwave are pretty
good-- the light metallic purple may be a bit lighter and paler than Shockwave
looks on the show, but it's a pretty nice color that both complememts and
contrasts against the dark purple paint apps. It also complements and contrasts
against Shockwave's silver and milky gray plastic. Usually I'm not a fan
of light milky gray plastic, but the swirliness and shade of it is a little
metallic-looking, which I actually don't mind. The one color choice I'm
not fond of is the charcoal black; a more pure black would've contrasted
and just generally looked better. (Of note is that, no, Shockwave's turret
can't move at all tabbed in like it's supposed to be; if you unpeg it it
can move on a balljoint at the rear, but this makes this mode a litle more
unstable than it already is.)

    Shockwave's robot mode--
due partially to how bad his vehicle mode is-- is very cohesive and a quite
solid-looking form, with the treads on his back being the only real vehicle
mode "extras", and those stay against his upper back and out of the way
quite well. The proportions are generally pretty good, though not quite
as show-accurate as his voyager-class toy; due primarily to what I assume
are engineering limitations at this size, his head is a bit small and his
shoulders a bit wide proportionally, while his upper legs are a bit smaller
in comparison to his lower legs; none of these are particularly egregious,
though. The only thing I really don't like about this mode is just how
huge his gun-arm is, due to its push-missile gimmick-- with the missile
in, it's longer than Shockwave is tall, and the underside of the launcher
is exposed in this mode, which just looks rather ugly. His mold detailing
is quite well-done, however, with most of the show details replicated fairly
well, such as his curved three-toed "feet", chest and head design, and
two back-spikes. With his alternating curved and pointed lines, he fits
right in with the rest of the Prime toyline. For articulation, Shockwave
can move at the shoulders (at three points, with one being his shoulder
"pads"), his elbows, his hips, his knees (at two points), and a bit at
his ankles. He has large feet, but he is slightly back-heavy; so overall
he's pretty well-articulated for a commander-class toy, but he can fall
backwards a bit more easily than I'd like.

    Prime Cyberverse Shockwave
has a pretty good color palette, articulation, and a good robot mode, but
his vehicle mode is even more haphazard and messy than on his voyager class
version. If you want one version of this character, I'd get the voyager
class toy, no contest.
