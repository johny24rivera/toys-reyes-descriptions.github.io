    Being one of the biggest
stars of the Fall of Cybertron video game, it was only logical that Grimlock
received one of the bigger-scale toys from the line. In his robotic t-rex
mode, Grimlock does a pretty good job of mixing old with new. He still
has the same major features and color layout of his G1 version, but his
stature's been modified a bit to how scientists currently think a t-rex
walked-- with its tail up in the air. His head design is also a bit different,
but in a good way, in my opinion. He does have a few proportional issues
in this mode, however, and neither of them are minor. For one, his tail
is way too bulky, being comprised of both of his legs, and looks off. Also,
although from a side view he looks fine, from a frontal view you can see
that Grimlock's chest/stomach area is entirely hollow in this mode, which
ruins the image of him being the "big buff brute" here, a little. His main
color scheme of various shades of gray with some light tan on the side
is a bit on the dull side, too. I understand that it's accurate for the
most part, but the dull tan really doesn't work well in place of the gold--
it really should've been painted. Plus, even on the metallic gold paint
that covers a few spots on Grimlock such as the sides of his tail, it STILL
manages to look dull, as it's way too pale. Thankfully, Grimlock has some
really eye-catching orangish red transparent plastic used for his eyes
(in both modes), the interior of his robot chest, and his weapons, which
at least gives him one nice-looking, bold main color. There's also a fair
number of silver and light red paint apps across his chassis-- the silver
blends in enough with his various shades of gray where it's not that big
of a deal, but the light red helps give Grimlock a bit more of the "FoC
energy piping" aesthetic and looks quite good against the gray and tan.
As for mold detailing, Grimlock's got plenty of it-- vents, hinges, and
the like are molded in everywhere (accurately to the video game model,
of course), so he definitely has no issues there. Grimlock's sword and
shield both look excellent, game-accurate, and quite intimidating, and
I love how the transparent plastic emulates the "energy weapon" quality
of these weapons. They can store on either of the hips of this mode, but
they look a little out-of-place when you do so; I wish there was a place
to store them that wasn't so conspicious. Unusual for voyager-class toys
nowdays, Grimlock has an electronic gimmick-- pull back on the tab behind
his head, and his mouth will open and light up orange, like he's getting
ready to breathe fire. This is a great, unobstrusive gimmick, and is one
of the highlights of the toy, particularly in dino mode. For articulation
here, Grimlock can move at the shoulders, mouth (if you pull it back; once
you let it go, it will spring back to the "closed" position); at three
points on each hip (though it's very oddly restricted here, due to the
manner in which Grimlock transforms); and at the knees (at two points),
slightly forward-and-back at the ankles, and at the base of each toe. I
wish his tail could swing a little, and his hips are definitely a bit annoying
to move around, but otherwise he's pretty good in that respect here. One
thing to watch out for-- the ball joints that Grimlock's dino arms are
on tend to be just a tad too big, so the pieces around them can split a
little. It's usually not bad enough for the dino arm to come off completely,
and can be fixed with a little glue, but it's still definitely worth mentioning.

    FoC Grimlock transforms
in a manner not dissimiliar to his original G1 toy, which means that although
he has a bit of a backpack made up of the neck/front arms/head of his dino
mode, otherwise he doesn't have any dino mode kibble in robot mode, which
is fairly impressive. His proportions are quite a bit better in this mode,
with the only obvious discrepency being that his legs are a little bit
two-dimensional; they look fine from the sides, but from a frontal view
they look a bit too skinny. I do love his broad shoulders and skinny waist,
though-- he really comes off much more like a hulking bruiser in this mode.
His headsculpt is extremely well-done, with the transparent piping for
his visor working very well and a bunch of awesome little mechanical details
around his neck. He also has a modified Autobot symbol on his chest with
a "dino mouth", the symbol for the Lightning Strike Coalition that he commanded
before becoming a Dinobot-- a nice touch, there. For articulation in this
mode, Grimlock can move at the neck, shoulders (at four points), elbows,
wrist rotation, and he can also move at the hips (at three points), and
knees (at two points). Unfortunately, two of his major articulation points
are "wonky" and can be a bit of a pain to pose-- namely, his shoulders
and knees. His shoulders have the same issues that his hips did in dino
mode, being an odd assembly of gears and friction joints that make you
almost think you're going to break them when rotating the shoulders outward--
though I have yet to have this happen to mine, it just FEELS weak and gives
a bit too much. At the knees, due to the way his legs transform he's got
an extra "knee" slightly below his "real" one, and neither locks into place
well, so it can be a bit tricky to move those tight joints without moving
his lower leg forward into an unsightly position. Surprisingly enough,
Grimlock's electronic gimmick also works in this mode-- pull back on the
same tab behind his dino head as before (which is now located on his back,
behind his chest) and the light from Grimlock's dino maw lights up the
translucent parts of his chest, including his chest details along the line
at the front, the two bits near the shoulders, his allegiance symbol, and
translucent design elements on his stomach. It looks quite cool, though
you've got light spread out rather unevenly due to the relatively narrow
area it projects into in this mode, so the light actually bleeds through
some of the solid plastic in the middle of his chest-- though it's still
a cool gimmick, regardless.

    FoC Grimlock has an
excellent robot mode (two-dimensional legs aside), but his dino mode proportions
have some definite issues-- particularly with the tail and the hollow-ness
of his chest and stomach area. His color scheme is also a bit unnecessarily
dull (more silver and gold paint would have improved it immensely.) His
gimmick is quite cool, though, as are his weapons, though his dino hip/robot
shoulder articulation points are quite wonky, as well as his robot knees.
If you're a fan of Grimlock and the FoC aesthetic, I'd recommend this toy
(mostly for the robot mode)-- temper your expectations, though, as his
dino mode can be a bit disappointing when you first lay eyes upon it.

      There was a time when the rage that
boils inside Grimlock would have driven him straight to the ranks of the
Decepticons. But while his flawed manner of speaking may make him sound
strange, he's smart enough to recognize a bully when he sees one-- and
Grimlock doesn't like bullies. It's this that fuels his dedication to the
fight against the Decepticons.

     *Grimlock was also released in an exclusive "Platinum Edition" set--
exclusive to several online retailers-- with the members of
     <a href="focsdccbruticus.html">
      FoC
Bruticus
     </a>
     . This Platinum Edition of Grimlock is nearly identical to
his mass release, the main and most obvious change being that most of his
tan parts were replaced with a chrome goldish yellow. (His abdomen had
also been painted silver.) Generally I think the chrome yellow is a bit
too much on the gaudy side, but it DOES give Grimlock considerably more
visual interest, so I think the Platinum Edition of this toy is slightly
better than the mass release.
