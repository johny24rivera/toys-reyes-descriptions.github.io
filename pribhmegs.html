    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime voyager
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Like most of the Beast
Hunters "upgrades", Sharkticon Megatron uses the same base mold as the
original 2012 Prime toy, but with extensive remolding done to give him
a much more bestial look. In case you couldn't figure it out from the name,
Megs now looks like he's been crossed with a Sharkticon-- to the same "extreme"
extent that most of the other Beast Hunters Autobots &amp; Decepticons
have been, but with a bit more focus specifically on sharks. Megatron looked
evil before, but now he looks positively monstrous-- nearly all of his
pieces have been remolded, aside from some minor robot parts like his upper
legs and arms, kneecaps, hands, and feet. He's now got large fins molded
onto his lower arms, coral-like decorations on his shoulders, scale-like
details on his legs, and, oh, yeah, a HUGE TERRIFYING SHARK MONSTER MAW
on his chest. Not only does all this make his robot mode look considerably
more distinct and fearsome, but it makes his vehicle mode actually LOOK
like something. Granted, it still doesn't have an Earth equivalent, but
the way the wings now look like scaled fins, the weird cockpit extension
now looks like a genuine shark monster head, and how there's a piece that
specifically covers up his robot head in vehicle mode are all big improvements.
Of course, since the core design isn't changed he still has all that undercarriage
junk, but it's still a pretty substantial improvement. Megatron's robot
head has also been remolded to look like he's part fish now, with no teeth
and fish-like lips. It looks decent enough, but honestly this is the only
part where I felt the original did it better-- his new headsculpt just
doesn't look as fierce without his sharp teeth. Megatron's fusion cannon
has been replaced with a "Sharktooth Spear", which has an incredible amount
of mold detailing covering every square inch, whether they're fake "eyes"
and a "mouth", jagged edges for the weapons, or more armored scale-like
parts. This weapon can change from a cannon-like weapon that looks like
it fires out of the "fish mouth" to a long double-bladed weapon he can
wield in robot mode-- and yes, the weapon CAN lock into this mode by pushing
the handle down, so all in all, it's a very cool accessory. That said,
there is one downside-- the handle for it to store on Megatron is a bit
overly long, due to it having to fit over the fins poking out from Megatron's
lower arms. This makes its placement look off in vehicle mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     As for Sharkticon Megatron's
color scheme, it takes his overall dull scheme with a bit of gray and adds
some traditional G1 Sharkticon colors to it. His dull colors of light gray
and the new dark brown are made more interesting due to the fact that there's
a bit of glitter in both of those shades to make them look semi-metallic.
The sky blue and pink paint apps are really what make Megatron's color
scheme pop, though, both contrasting incredibly excellently with his other
dark, dull colors in that weird late-80s Sharkticon manner. There's also
a bit of dark purple on his legs, chest, and weapon, though I wish it was
just a tad lighter so it could contrast both with the dark brown and the
light blue-- as it is, it doesn't show up well against the brown in normal
lighting. There's also a bit of silver for the shark teeth, some light
green for his robot eyes and fake "shark eyes" on both his main body and
his weapon, and even a bit of metallic green solely reserved for his upper
chest. One final note is that there's a really cool Decepticon/Sharkticon
symbol on the top of his vehicle mode, which looks like the Decepticon
symbol suddenly went insane and demonic, with its wider eyes and long,
gaping sharktooth jaw. Wonderfully done.

     Sharkticon Megatron
is one of my favorite Beast Hunters upgrades. Beyond being incredibly inventive
overall, it also makes his alt mode look a lot more sensical and hides
that all-important robot head in said mode. He's also just got some great,
monstrous fish detailing that really makes this far better than your usual
Megatron upgrade, and a color scheme with a lot of paint (albeit none on
the back of his arm-fins, sadly) that makes him look a bit loud in that
late '80s/early '90s way that a lot of the Beast Hunters upgrades seem
to call back to. An easy recommendation if you're at all into the "Beast
Hunters" aesthetic.

        Trapped in a tangle of ancient wreckage,
his comm unit so damaged that he can monitor what is happening on Earth
but cannot transmit, Megatron seethes with rage. He gropes around in the
pitch black silence of the ancient wreck, but he feels nothing but rubble.
Until suddenly, his hand happens upon something new. It is the grip of
a weapon-- unclaimed by the Autobot raid-- one that is familiar, though
he never thought he would hold it again. He feels memories stir deep within
his data banks, and remembers a time long ago on a world consumed by savage
hunger. His damaged systems surge to life. The jagged metal pinning him
shifts, then twists and warps, bonding itself with his body, repairing
damage, but also changing him. His nightvision systems restored, he looks
down at the weapon in his hand. It is an object of incredible power-- enough,
perhaps, to bring the Predacons under control, and do away with the Autobots
for good.
