    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is a Chevrolet Camaro, as you no doubt know by now. So the overall look
of the vehicle mode and color scheme should come as no surprise-- you've
seen it many times before. It's replicated quite well at this scale, with
even small details like the door handles and gas tank nozzle painted silver.
There really isn't any single major detail that isn't painted on this figure,
which is good considering its price. What's exceptional about this Bumblebee
compared to the others is that this one actually has seats inside and a
steering wheel (as is pretty much a prerequisite given the Human Alliance
gimmick). The little Sam Witwicky figure he comes with fits quite well
in his seat, with the peg-hole in his back fitting in snugly on the peg
on Bumblebee's seat. (As a side-note, like other Human Alliance human figures,
Sam Witwicky is sort of like a mini-G.I. JOE figure, with great articulation
at all the relevant points-- though because of his realistic proportions,
his small feet mean he doesn't stand up very well by himself. His paint
detailing is quite good for such a small figure.) There's no real robot
mode extras at all in this mode, with one exception-- the back of the feet
stick out somewhat obviously from the rear end of the vehicle, but that's
a moderate complaint at best. Overall, a very solid mode.

    Like almost any other
Human Alliance toy, Bumblebee's transformation is rather involved and a
bit complex, but you get a big payoff with a great robot mode as well.
The proportions for the most part are quite well-done and very movie-accurate.
The only exceptions to this are the seats on the sides of his arms-- part
of the whole Human Alliance gimmick-- and his lower legs. The lower legs
are made up of the the rear sides and back panels of his car mode flattened
out into more leg-shaped "blocks" than anything else, and as far as design
goes is my only real sore spot about this mode. Panels of his front bumper
come forward and angle a bit to provide the more movie-accurate "fractured"
look of the chest, but unfortunately they're on some kinda spring, as they
pop back into their default vehicle position way too easily and are honestly
kind of annoying. All of the necessary mold detailing is here, and then
some-- Bumblebee's "robot parts" have a ton of little details over them,
especially near the midsection. For articulation, Bumblebee's got ya covered--
he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at three points), elbows
(at two points), at the base of his thumb and his three fingers (the latter
all as one piece) on his right hand, the wrists (at two points) on his
right hand, the waist, hips (at two points), knees (at three points), and
ankles. So given his two-pronged rear feet, which gives him a fairly stable
stance, you can really get him into some great poses. The panels on his
upper legs and the chairs on his lower arms are really the only bits that
hinder any sort of movement at all-- the roof, in particular, accordions
up quite nicely onto his back. As for gimmicks, Bumblebee's got many, and
for the most part they don't really interfere with other aspects of the
figure. For one, Sam can peg into holes either on the seats on the back
of either of his lower arms or stand on a small platform in an alcove in
his back. On his arms, Sam can "man" either a shoulder-mounted twin-cannon
assembly that swings over his shoulders or just sorta sit on Bumblebee's
lower right arm, which is in a perma-convert to his cannon-arm, which can
be stocked with one of two missiles that can be fired out of the spring-loaded
launcher in said cannon. (The missiles are stored on the undersides in
car mode, by the by.) As for the pedestal in Bumblbeee's back, there's
a small extra gun and pod missile launcher that pop out above Bumblebee's
head, so one could imagine this is what Sam "mans" back there. In addition,
Bumblebee also his battle-mask feature, allowing you to slide down his
forehead over his face to give him the "mask" look or leave it up for his
more traditional look. When it's down the mask does tend to "stick out"
a bit much from the rest of the face, but this is pretty much unavoidable,
really.

    Human Alliance Bumblebee,
while expensive, is a great, incredibly well-designed figure with a lot
of fun features that really don't get in the way of the "essentials" like
articulation and proportions. If you want the most "'Bee for your buck",
I'd still recommend one of the many deluxe versions of this character,
but if you want a good, quintessential version of the character with a
lot of features, this will make a great "centerpiece" to any Bumblebee
shelf. Highly recommended.

      Bumblebee and Sam were best friends
almost from the moment they first met face to face. As they learned more
about one another, that connection grew deeper and deeper. Now, whether
Sam is behind the wheel, or standing side by side with his friend, they
worth together as a team. Against Bumblebee and his human friend, no Decepticon
stands a chance.

      (NOTE: This figure was also re-released for the yellow-box "Autobot
Alliance" toyline in fall 2010. The only difference between that later
release and this one is that Sam's shirt is white on the yellow-box version.)
