    Drift's Bugatti Veyron
vehicle mode transfers over to his Power Battler version pretty flawlessly.
Really, it's hard to say ANYTHING negative about this mode-- the proportions
are perfect, there's no robot mode extras whatsoever, even on the back
end, and all of the necessary details are molded in (such as the more detailed
bits on the engine on the back). The color scheme is pretty nice too, faithfully
replicating Drift's color scheme on the big screen, with dark blue being
his main color (though it should be noted that this shade is a bit flatter
and not quite as metallic as on some of his other toys). The silver used
for the windows and headlights is a great color to contrast against the
dark blue, and the electric blue line around the bottom of this car mode
(and around the front grill) helps to add a nice finishing touch that both
contrasts against and complements the main color. There are a few details
that could've been painted but weren't, however-- the taillights are unpainted,
which is my biggest issue. A couple more minor details also aren't painted,
like the back and bottom front grill (in fact, the front grill is partially
painted by the electric blue stripe that just does right across it, actually
ignoring those molded-in details)! I do quite enjoy that something as minor
as the Bugatti logo on the front is painted a dark red, given how incredibly
tiny it is.

    Drift's transformation
mostly consists of folding up the sides of his vehicle mode to form the
legs in a rather ingenious manner, with the roof of his vehicle mode scrunching
up a little behind his back. It's this latter bit that is my biggest issue
with this toy overall; Hasbro... really did not know what to do with the
car parts and still give Drift a Power Battler-style transformation, I
guess. The roof sections fold up a LITTLE, but generally they're just hanging
behind the entire back of his robot mode, the vehicle front hood actually
going all the way down to the knees-- what makes it all the worse is that
this front part is the widest section of his back kibble. Even if you were
to be generous and call it an "armor skirt", it looks really odd as one.
The other issue with the mode is that Drift looks too stiff and a bit one-dimensional
in this mode. Now, this isn't a comment on his articulation-- a toy can
have little articulation and still be in a "natural" pose in robot mode--
but this toy doesn't do that. Drift's arms are stubbornly right next to
his sides, and his legs are a little too flat on the front. From a side
view, Drift's two-dimensional manner kicks in-- he's not COMPLETELY 2-D,
but his proportions-- particularly in the arms and main body-- aren't nearly
as wide as they should be. He's not nearly "deep" enough. (The legs look
just fine from a side-on view, though.) Drift's feet are also bit on the
small side, which can cause him to wobble a bit easier than I'd like. On
the plus side, Drift's mold detailing is REALLY good in this mode, with
layered armor-like details on the hips and shoulder flaps and quite intricate
detailing of pistons, springs, and the like on his arms, legs, and chest.
His headsculpt is also quite well-done-- though once again, Drift has inaccurate
paint details, with his face being silver and his headcrest inaccurately
being electric blue-- considering how central the face is to his look,
I hate that this keeps happening with his AoE toys. On the negative side,
though, Drift's faux car hood-chest is molded just a bit too small. Drift's
color scheme is more broken up in this mode, with more electric blue and
light milky gray making their appearance here. The electric blue still
goes great with all the dark blue. The light milky gray, however, is not
only an ugly, boring color, but isn't movie-accurate either. (I would have
MUCH preferred if it was closer to the paint on Drift's crotch, which is
a really nice shade of gunmetal gray.) For his Power Battler gimmick, by
turning Drift at the waist, his arms will swing out (one towards the back,
one towards the front-- which one goes in which direction depends on which
way you rotate his waist), with the swords folded behind said arms coming
out for a "Sword Slash" attack, just as the packaging asserts. Drift's
face also rotates to look to his forward-slashing arm, which is a nice
touch. As soon as you let go of the arms/waist, they spring back into their
default "sheathed" position. It's honestly a neat gimmick, though the backpack
kibble gets in the way of it being a "clean rotation" often, and I wish
the pieces that pulled out Drift's swords weren't so obvious under his
arms. Because of this gimmick, Drift has no traditional movement above
the hips, which is unfortunate. However, he does partially make up for
it with better leg articulation than most Power Battlers-- he can move
at the hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and slightly at the
feet.

    Power Battler Drift
has a near-perfect vehicle mode and a pretty addictive, fun little gimmick,
but unfortunately this gimmick comes at a steep price. Drift has some fairly
major proportional and kibble issues in robot mode-- the entire top of
the car hangs unceremoniously behind his back, his arms and body aren't
nearly as "deep" as they should be from a side angle, and he looks way
too stiff. I wish not as much was sacrificed for said gimmick, but still,
overall he's about a middle-of-the-road toy for the Power Battler line,
maybe SLIGHTLY below the median. If you want a simpler-to-transform Drift,
I'd go for the Flip 'n Change version instead.
