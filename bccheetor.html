    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Clocker. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Clocker

     Cheetor's pre-Beast Wars
body is, appropriately enough, taken from the mold of Cybertron Clocker.
I'm rather surprised that
     <a href="override.html">
      Override's mold
     </a>
     wasn't
used, given that a head remold wouldn't have been necessary since her head
design is so close to Cheetor's, but Override wasn't that good of a mold
anyways, so I can't say I'm dissapointed. As you'd expect, this form of
Cheetor has the same colors as his
     <a href="cheetor.html">
      original Beast
Wars form
     </a>
     , but with more yellow and less blue. In fact, yellow and
the transparent blue used for the windshield and wheels are the only base
plastic colors at all-- all the other blue is painted on. The metallic
dull blue does look very nice, however (especially on the exhaust pipes)
and Cheetor has more than enough paint apps, but I still would've preferred
to see some more blue on him, just to break up all that yellow more, since
I'm not a huge fan of the color. I think that the spotted seat covers in
vehicle mode is a nice nod to his "future" Beast Wars form, but that would've
been enough, I think. Using the spots also on his chest and under his eyes
in robot mode is a bit TOO much of a coincidence when it comes to the beast
form he later gets for me to swallow, myself. The honkin' huge Maximal
allegiance symbol on the front hood of the vehicle mode is also a bit tacky,
too, and not something I'd expect on a high-end convention exclusive figure,
frankly. The small Maximal symbol on his left leg is enough. The thing
that I really find absolutely ingenious about this toy, though, is how
they made the robot chest look somewhat like the later cheetah head he'd
have on his chest-- the air pipes and black rectangle at the waist for
the whiskers and nose, the green "eyes" and black "pupils" on the sides
of the chest, and of course the aforementioned spotted chest is incredibly
inspired, especially when you realize that this part of the toy wasn't
remolded from its original uses in the Cybertron toyline.

     Cheetor is one of the
lucky ones to get a new head remolded, and it looks pretty spot-on when
compared to the original toy's head, though the side head antennae have
been dulled down a bit-- likely so that the head can fit into its assigned
space in vehicle mode-- and Cheetor's face looks... younger, somehow, which
is certainly appropriate. All in all, very good head remold. Also, like
all the other toys in the Botcon set, the Cyber Key used in the Cybertron
version has instead been replaced with a solid gray Planet X Key bearing
a Maximal symbol and a painted bit of Golden Disk detailing over the main
part of the Cyber Key, hence the new name "Golden Disk Key".

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Axalon Cheetor is a
fine Botcon exclusive, with accurate colors and a ton of paint apps, in
addition to the ingenious "cat chest" design he's got going on. However,
I've never been a fan of yellow on the vast majority of Transformers, and
Cheetor is no exception, especially since that's the only solid plastic
color the toy's got on it. As such, he's my least favorite out of the various
uses the Clocker mold has gotten, as his color scheme simply doesn't match
up to the awesomeness of the others.

       The youngest of the Axalon crew, "Cheetor"
is enthusiastic, impulsive and brave. A former cadet in the Maximal Command
Security Force, Cheetor left in search of an adventure that would take
him to the far reaches of space. Seeing leadership potential in the young
Maximal, Optimus Primal recruited him to join the Axalon crew, hoping their
mission of discovery would help develop his innate abilities while teaching
him ways to curb his abundant enthusiasm. At the core of all of Cheetor's
actions is his desire to prove himself to the older Maximals that he idolizes,
such as Optimus Primal, whom he refers to as "Big Bot." Cheetor, the fastest
Maximal aboard the Axalon, can reach speeds of up to 550 mph in vehicle
form with a range of 1500 miles. His specially designed engine block converts
into a dual barrelled Quasar Cannon for offensive strikes. While his Axalon
crewmates sometimes express impatience with him, ultimately they all feel
a sense of responsibility to help him grow and develop.
