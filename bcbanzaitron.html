    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Mirage. For a review

     Banzai-Tron is an homage
to an obscure G1 character of the same name, who was an Action Master originally
and thus had no alternate mode. This exclusive version of him gives him
a gunship-boat thing as an alt mode, which is just as good as anything
else! Most of the focus of the paint app placement has, appropriately,
been on the robot mode to make it as accurate as possible to the original
Banzai-Tron. The dull gray quite honestly makes for a rather dull main
color, but when you add in all the accent colors on the toy, everything
really pops-- the dark purple looks good enough, but that light green and
light orange... yeah, it may not be realistic, but it looks DARN good against
the purple, gray, and bits of black that make up most of Banzai-Tron's
plastic colors. The transparent orange used for the toy looks almost as
good as an accent color, as well. The placement of the paint apps is fairly
varied and particularly striking in robot mode. It's also pretty accurate
compared to the G1 toy, particularly on the head and chest. He REALLY looks
like Banzai-Tron, especially considering that the head mold isn't changed
and was never meant to be the character in question. A nice touch is that
the symbols on the side of the boat mode are a Cybertronian font that,
when translated, spell out "TO THE VICTOR GO THE PROFITS", a perfect summation
of Banzai-Tron's philosophy.

     No mold changes have
been made to Banzai-Tron, though as is the case with most Botcon exclusives,
his electronics have been gutted.

     Botcon 2009 Banzai-Tron
is one of the best Energon molds in a fantastic, eye-catching color scheme
and a great homage to boot. It's hard to see where you can go wrong here,
assuming you have the dough to be in the market for one of these exclusives.
My personal favorite of the Botcon 2009 exclusives.

       To call Banzai-Tron pragmatic would
be an understatement. His spark contains a deep-seated desire to acquire
wealth. To that end, he has recently taken on the study of an ancient Cybertronian
martial art form known as Crystalocution, which focuses on attacking an
enemy's metal fracture points. So practical is this Decepticon warrior
that he has decided to forgo the more mystical aspects of learning the
art, and instead has focused only on its deadly methodology. When criticized
about this, he curtly responds "There is no profit in spirituality." In
gunboat mode, Banzai-Tron can travel at speeds up to 260 KTS. His primary
weapons are four missile launchers. The two launchers on the front can
double as energy blasters. He also carries four short-range rockets with
adjustable power settings that can be set from stun to disintegrate. Sometimes
he becomes too focused on profit and fails to see the larger scope of events
around him.
