    Barricade's police car
mode is very "chibi-fied" in its proportions, being much wider and stubbier
proportionally than it should be, but this is, of course, perfectly appropriate
for a toy aimed at kids too young to handle "normal" Transformers. His
mold detailing is pretty sparse-- again, because of the whole "young kiddies"
thing-- but he's got a good amount of paint detailing. All of his windows
are painted a nice shade of silver that goes very well with the black (though
his rear side windows aren't painted, for some reason), and his sirens
are painted their usual blue-and-red as well. Barricade has the same "POLICE"
and "643" emblems painted on him, but sadly he doesn't the hilarious "To
Punish and Enslave" logo on him anywhere, nor the Decepticon/Police Crest
hybrid.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Barricade can be locked in police car mode by pushing the white tab on
the bottom of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Barricade's
robot body into his car mode, the police car will take off (providing he's
on a flat surface), and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode
body will pop back up again. Because of this gimmick, Barricade doesn't
really have any lower body in robot mode, just most of his car mode. His
main body, head, and arms are molded onto the underside of his car mode
roof and doors. He also has very limited articulation-- he can move at
the head and front-and-back at the arms, though the arms snap back to their
default position once you let go of them-- but something like that isn't
a priority on this type of toy, anyways. The detailing on the robot parts
is quite good while being slightly "kiddified" for the most part, though
I do miss Barricade's HUGE SHARP CLAWS OF DEATH that have been replaced
with normal fists on this toy. Still, someone as evil-looking as Barricade
shows off the central crux when designing an evil character in a PG-13
as a toy made for kids barely past their toddler stage-- Barricade's head
looks danged SCARY, as they didn't "kiddify" his head design at all, and
it just looks completely out of place on the toy, regardless of the excellent
mold and paint detailing.

    Cyber Slammer Barricade
is one of the better-looking Cyber Slammers (because of his paint job,
primarily), but it's odd to see such a scary head on an otherwise kiddie-fied
toy. If you're considering buying a Cyber Slammer for a young one, you
may want to go with

     Bumblebee

    first,
who looks more kid-friendly all around.
