     Stepper here is a bit
of a "re-do", according to Pete Sinclair, the head "Transformers" guy at
FunPub. He didn't particularly like how
     <a href="bcricochet2.html">
      Shattered
Glass Ricochet
     </a>
     turned out, so here's another stab at the character--
this time using the Japanese name of Ricochet, Stepper. Stepper has-- more
or less-- an "inverse color scheme" compared to the usual
     <a href="g1ricochet.html">
      Stepper/Ricochet
     </a>
     ,
who normally is mostly black and white with gold flames. For Shattered
Glass Stepper, the white is more or less in the same places (being mostly
visible in robot mode), but the amount and placement of the "gold" and
black have been flipped. In place of most of the gold, however, SG Stepper
has orange, likely because covering a toy in metallic gold paint would
have been a bit too expensive even by BotCon paint app standards. It's
a slightly paler orange than is usually used on TFs, but I don't mind it
as it keeps Stepper from looking too bright. It and the black go together
exceptionally well, giving Stepper a "Halloweeny" color scheme, particularly
in vehicle mode. The white also goes go well with both the black (obviously)
and the orange, making for a very pleasing color scheme overall. I LOVE
the black flames in vehicle mode in particular, which take the place of
the gold flames traditionally on "normal" Ricochet/Stepper. It has the
same "gas-like" flame deco like those on
     <a href="bcrodimus.html">
      Shattered
Glass Rodimus
     </a>
     , which look a bit more evil and feathery than your typical
wood-flames on TFs. (Though Stepper does have that traditional flame pattern
on his chest.) There is actually a decent amount of gold on Stepper as
well, though it's relegated mostly to accent colors-- the wheel hubs, spoiler,
headlights and front grill are all this shade of gold. It's a greenish
gold, though, which was kind of an odd choice-- it still looks good, but
a "pure" gold would have looked better. There's also some excellent gold
lining all of his flame paint apps, which just makes the flames look even
better. For light piping, Stepper has some translucent yellow, which works
very well against his reverse "white head, black face" colors. As an accent
color, Stepper has a little bit of dark metallic blue, used for his taillights
and smaller headlights. It's a nice little addition, especially on the
taillights, since there's few paint apps back there. (Why is the back window
not painted? It's a BotCon toy, details like that shouldn't be overlooked!)
Other than the vehicle mode rear, though, there isn't any large unpainted
area on Stepper. (That said, the speakers look odd without any paint on
them all, even if they're small parts.)

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nebulon is an odd little
extra, given that he doesn't naturally come with the mold and said mold
     <a href="bcferak.html">
      was used
     </a>
     in the boxset for the previous year.
However, the original Ricochet/Stepper had a Targetmaster, so I guess SG
Stepper gets one too. He can't store in Stepper's vehicle mode at all,
unfortunately. That said, his mostly dark periwinkle color scheme contrasts
against Stepper's very well, and the white on him ties him in with his
larger partner figure. There's also a bit of gray on the shoulders as well
as a silver face and red eyes, neither of which add or subtract much from
the color scheme.

may be a redeco of a mold that Fun Pub's already redecoed multiple times,
and he may not be the most original idea, but that doesn't change the fact
that it's a darned good color scheme on a darned good mold, and he comes
with a bonus Targetmaster to boot. In terms of color scheme, he's my favorite
from the "core" BotCon 2015 boxset, and only SLIGHTLY behind

       Stability has never really been the
defining factor of Stepper's existence, nor his mind. When his former teammate
Ricochet developed the coveted "Targetmaster" technology, the envious Stepper
created his own spark-less, processor-less Targetmaster that he dubbed
"Nebulon". Essentially just a remotely controlled puppet, Stepper was a
talented-enough ventriloquist to convince everyone that Nebulon was a real,
living bot. At times, he even convinced himself.

       Stepper, then partnered with the slightly
unhinged Drift, was assigned the task of hunting down any intruders from
neighboring universal streams. During a confrontation with a team of "Gobots",
Nebulon was destroyed. The resulting explosion opened up a rift in reality,
which sent Stepper spiraling into the Axiom Nexus, where he currently resides.

       Irony struck when Stepper met his newest
partner, an actual, living Nebulon. This "new" Nebulon has helped bolster
the confidence of Stepper through positive reinforcement and more than
a little bit of manipulation. Nebulon is the new puppet master, and his
less-than-legal ambitions are becoming reality through his loyal marionette,
Stepper.
