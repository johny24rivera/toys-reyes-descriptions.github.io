    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Universe 2.0 Legends
class Hound figure. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the Universe 2.0 Legends class Hound figure

     "Tracker" Hound's color
scheme replaces his signature green color scheme with a primarily black
scheme. (I guess that's supposed to be for stealth to help him track, or
something.) Usually I tend to like color schemes that have black as a major
part of them; however, the key word there is
     <i>
      a
     </i>
     major part. There
needs to be another major high-contrast color to help make the color scheme
pop. The metallic gunmetal gray paint used on a fair amount of Tracker
Hound-- from his front grill to his back area to his windshield-- is a
pretty nice shade of the color, but it keeps the overall feeling pretty
monochrome. Thankfully, there's a nice gold stripe going around the vehicle
mode (and a bit on his waist in robot mode) that keeps him from being completely
one-tone, but it's just a few paint apps, and far more of an accent than
any sort of major color. As such, Tracker Hound comes up looking a little
more boring than he otherwise would have been, particularly since ALL of
his plastic is black, with the other colors just being paint.

     Tracker Hound is an
okay "stealth" redeco, but without any major contrast color against the
black, he ends up being a bit monotonous and dull. It's not a bad color
scheme by any means-- nothing clashes-- but I'd recommend the original
Hound color scheme over this one.
