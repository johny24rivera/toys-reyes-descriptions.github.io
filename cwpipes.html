    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations

     Pipes here certainly
has "Pipes-ish" colors, with blue and silver/gray being his main two colors.
The problem is-- in vehicle mode, blue is nearly ALL of the visible plastic.
It's a nice shade of blue, but used this much, the toy just looks dull.
There are some silver paint apps in vehicle mode-- most notable on the
windows, front bumper and headlights, and on the back end that becomes
his robot legs-- but this isn't nearly enough. This is particularly the
case since-- with the exception of the black wheels and gun and just a
touch of red on the back-- silver is the ONLY other paint app color readily
visible in this mode. Given that this is the fourth mass-release version
of this mold, Hasbro really should've spiced up this recolor with more...
well... colors, G1-accurate or not. In robot mode Pipes' color scheme is
slightly better, with silver now on his lower arms and a bit of red on
his knees and face. His abs and upper legs are also gray, though unfortunately
it's that really bland light milky gray plastic that-- though it does break
up the blue some-- doesn't really improve Pipes' colors at all otherwise.
Pipes' blue is broken up to an adequate extent in this mode, but he still
needed another color or two-- blue and silver/gray by themselves do not
an interesting color scheme make.

     Pipes has the same new
headsculpt that
     <a href="cwhuffer.html">
      Combiner Wars Huffer
     </a>
     had. Although
the new headsculpt fit Huffer, the body didn't really fit Huffer. For Pipes,
this is even worse-- now not even the HEAD fits him. Even though G1 Pipes
used the same base mold as G1 Huffer, he had a substantially different
head with a single visor and a faceplate. In the IDW comics released around
this time he had the same face as well, so it's not like the "Huffer head"
was a recent development. The red face also just looks rather odd, and
I've rarely been a fan of that color being used on faces. Pipes has no
mold changes unique to this release.

     Combiner Wars Pipes
is a pretty good mold design, but otherwise a complete disappointment.
His color scheme is dull with not even interesting accent colors (particularly
in vehicle mode), his robot mode proportions don't really fit the character,
and Huffer's face doesn't fit the character. In short, other than being
an Autobot truck cab, this toy doesn't really fit as Pipes at all. Only
recommended for completists-- otherwise, get one of the other, more interesting
versions of this mold.
