    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Arcee. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Arcee

     Flareup was originally
intended to be a new version of G1 Firestar, but a trademark issue was
discovered early in the game, so instead the toy was made into a brand
new character. Flareup has a very nice, fiery color scheme-- red, black,
and orange are great main colors to use for a paint scheme, and the transparent
orange used for Flareup's chip and weapon looks very cool. There's plenty
of different accent colors to help vary Flareup's color scheme even more,
however, such as the bone white used for her face and the silver used for
her boots and collar. As far as mold changes go, she's got the same new
head that her fellow exclusive
     <a href="chromia.html">
      Chromia
     </a>
     does--
it's a pretty decent headmold, though I think a bit more mold detailing
could have been used on the top of the head. The paint detailing is great,
however, though the little "chin strap" isn't painted like it was on Chromia.
I actually prefer this lack of another paint application there, as I think
the chin strap looks a little out-of-place anyways, so anything that doesn't
bring more notice to it is fine by me.

     Of note is that in addition
to being a Botcon 2005 exclusive, you could only buy Flareup for $65 with
Ratchet at the convention-- it was not available free to preregistrants
or available at all to those who did not attend the convention. Flareup
is limited to 500 pieces, so she's worth a pretty penny.

     Flareup is a great repaint
of the Arcee mold, with awesome "fiery" color choices and more than enough
paint apps to go around. I like it better than the Energon Arcee color
scheme, though obviously you have to factor in whether you want to fork
over the money to buy Flareup.

       Flareup was a student of rescue operations
officer, Firestar. She learned the art of rescue well, but soon developed
a fondness for destruction rarely seen among Autobots, however, her love
of destruction is not a love of violence. It is an appreciation of the
planning behind demolitions as if it were an art form. Flareup has an extremely
cheerful disposition, which unnerves other Autobots as it seems to run
contrary to the grim nature of her work.

       Abilities: In vehicle mode, Flareup
is capable at traveling at 330 mph. She maneuvers readily and can utilize
both her missile launcher and laser canon in this form. These two weapons
combine to form a powerful weapon for Flareup in robot mode. Her skin is
made of special composite that allows her to withstand temperatures of
up to 8,000 degrees centigrade Flareup is an expert at the use of "smart"
explosive charges to destroy a target.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Weakness: Flareup sometimes gets too
wrapped up in the planning of her demolitions and does not take proper
precautions to protect herself from the results of her handiwork, leading
to injury.
