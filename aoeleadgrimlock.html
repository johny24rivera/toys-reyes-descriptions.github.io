    Grimlock's beast mode
of a t-rex made of armor and knives is replicated... pretty poorly for
his leader class toy, sadly. There's certainly some upsides to it, so let's
cover those first; the headsculpt is VERY nicely done with the horns more
pronounced on this version (and made of rubbery plastic for safety reasons).
The legs also look pretty nice proportionally, and the only obvious robot
extras in this mode are the robot feet and hands, the former of which are
just... there... in front of the upper legs, though they do fit Grimlock's
overall silhouette pretty well. The latter are clearly visible as "heels"
holding the t-rex feet in a stable position, but they're pretty small overall
and generally easily overlooked. The mold detailing for this toy is also
incredibly well done. There's armor and spike-like details EVERYWHERE,
from the the "spine" down the upper ridged back to little mechanical bits
visible on the sides of his legs to a really nice ridged pattern on his
lower back and tail. The many teeth in Grimlock's maw also look great,
and are, again, made of the rubbery kind of plastic. He's even got rubbery
"rib cage" spikes on his underside, though the front ones can bend slightly
over time. Unfortunately, Grimlock's overall proportions in this mode are
just horrendous. His body is FAR too long and a bit too flat, while his
tail isn't long enough. His t-rex arms are also too short and small, even
for t-rex arms. The middle of his chest has a big gap in it, which looks
off from an underside angle. It all just looks very odd. He's got a TON
of chrome visible in this mode-- the front half of the back being mostly
chrome silver, while the back half of the back suddenly becoming chrome
copper, which tapers down to copper paint on the tail. The chrome copper
might've looked okay used in a lesser amount, but why all the chrome silver?
It looks gaudy in the amount it's used, and unlike with

    , Grimlock's chrome tends to chip easier, probably because
of all the details on those pieces and how certain chrome parts peg into
other chrome parts for transformation. The rest of his color scheme in
this mode is mostly metallic copper or black-- both nice colors that I
wish had been more prevalent over the whole toy. The sky blue eyes do look
nice as well, even if they're movie inaccurate and should be yellow. For
articulation in this mode, Grimlock can move at the jaw, up-and-down at
the neck, shoulders, elbows, hips (at two points, one of them ratcheting),
knees (at two points, again, one ratcheted), and slightly forward-and-back
at the ankles. I wish his tail could move a bit, but all things considered
it's pretty decent articulation for a t-rex alt mode.

    Grimlock's transformation
is quite complex-- in fact, he's probably the most complex mold in the
entire AoE line. Getting him to robot isn't that difficult, but getting
everything lined up for beast mode can be quite perplexing, especially
the first few times-- particularly when it comes to how to position his
legs, given how they basically turn themselves inside out and peg into
several places almost simultaneously. Fair warning. That said, Grimlock's
robot mode is a MASSIVE improvement over his beast mode-- granted, that
isn't hard, but his robot mode is pretty darned good. The best part is
the proportions-- his legs are just a touch two-dimensional in that they're
a bit skinny from viewed from a head-on angle, but otherwise his proportions
are pretty perfect. There is a little bit of kibble in this mode, but the
only bits that bother me are the dino feet on the back of the lower robot
arms-- they're kind of large bits, there. The upper tail section folds
behind Grimlock's back, up and out of the way, and doesn't get in the way
of movement. Every other t-rex part goes well with this mode; I love the
further folding-up of the t-rex head-halves on Grimlock's shoulders, still
emphasizing the teeth but not making them too large like on most of the
Grimlock head-halves on other toys for him in this line. The way little
rubbery bits of his "dino teeth" go from his chest to peg into his shoulders
seemlessly is also a great touch. The mold detailing for his robot parts
isn't quite as intricate as his beast mode detailing, but it's still done
very well-- particularly the armor plating-like detailing on the chest
and the very nicely detailed headsculpt, complete with a nice shiny metallic
copper head, (inaccurate) sky blue eyes, and a black face with a gray headcrest--
it all makes him look incredibly fearsome. Also, the usage of Grimlock's
chrome on his chest is the sole use of that on this toy that I don't consider
gaudy-- it makes it look more like he's wearing armor, as befits a "knight".
Grimlock also comes with a pretty cool mace weapon that is formed from
his tail, with sections of the tail sliding down the shaft and folding
around to make for a pretty nice spike-weapon-- and, unlike his voyager
class version, he can actually hold the weapon by the shaft in this mode,
as it's supposed to be held! He's also got a shield which can slot into
the side of one of his lower arms, though it's a bit small overall and
the odd (rubbery) spikes on the front and bottom look weird-- it's all
too obviously a section of his beast mode. For articulation, in this mode
Grimlock can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points-- one of them ratcheting),
elbows (at two points-- one of them ratched), rotation at the elbows, hips
(at three points, two of them ratchets), knees (at one point, ratcheted),
and ankles (at two points). He's pretty well-balanced, and I wish they
would have included some waist movement on the toy given it's a rather
expensive Leader-class figure, but other than that he's quite poseable
in this mode.

    AoE Leader Grimlock
is a mixed bag. His robot mode is absolutely amazing in nearly every respect,
with great proportions, almost no annoying beast mode kibble, excellent
articulation, and some great sculpting with a neat-o mace weapon-- my favorite
robot mode of this design, definitely. However, the t-rex just has really
bad, awkward proportions that are unacceptable for a toy this large, and
looks worse than the
    <a href="aoevoygrimlock.html">
     voyager toy
    </a>
    (which
already doesn't look too great in beast mode to begin with). The chrome
is also used to an obnoxious extent, not really fitting anywhere except
on the robot chest. Thus, despite the slightly better robot mode, I'd recommend
the voyager version of this design more-- the beast mode of said voyager
is better than the leader's by a larger margin than this version's robot
mode is better than the voyager's, and this one costs over twice as much.
