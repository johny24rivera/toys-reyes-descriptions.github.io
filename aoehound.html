    Hound's OSHKOSH military
transport truck alternate mode is represented quite faithfully here-- the
proportions are very spot-on, and other than just a touch of his upper
legs sticking out from the bottom middle, there are no robot mode extras
whatsoever in this mode (impressive, given his robot mode design). The
back end is a bit sparsely detailed, but the rest of this mode has excellent
mold detailing-- the rails on the sides, all the little details along the
edges and center of each tire, the front grill and bar in front of the
transparent windows-- all the necessary details are here. The problem is,
only the very front of this mode is really painted. The various headlights
are painted silver or copper, there's a black stripe along the grill in
the front (complete with a tiny OSHKOSH logo), and the bottom bars are
painted silver. That's it. Nearly all of the rest of this mold is a dark
military bluish green, with a bit of milky gray (mostly due to the weapons)
and black wheels. The front windows are also clear plastic, though there
isn't a detailed interior or anything-- just a gray bar of plastic a little
behind the windows. Now, granted, paint apps have certainly gotten more
expensive, but out of all the "mainline" AoE toys, Hound probably needs
paint the worst. To have so much of a voyager-class toy-- the side rails,
the top hatch, the rear section, the taillights and rear bumper-- all unpainted
dark green plastic is just a crying shame, given all the detailing in most
of those spots. It's also very obviously inaccurate to the movie, to boot.
Before I get onto the robot mode, though, I'd be remiss to not mention
what is arguably Hound's defining factor on this toy-- his HUGE assortment
of weapons. He's got two pistols, a (silver-painted) dagger, two short
little guns that look like some sort of grenade launchers, two medium-sized
blasters, and a quite large triple-barreled rotary machine gun weapon--
all of these weapons have various slots and pegs and can be combined in
various different ways as well, and there's little ports and pegs on the
sides of Hound's vehicle mode to hold them, along with a 5mm port on the
top to hold one more. Really, having one toy with this amount of weaponry--
and how customizable it all is-- is just lovely.

    Hound's transformation
to robot mode mostly involves unfolding the feet from the bottom half of
his truck mode, splitting apart various wide panels and folding them around
his midsection to cover up his front vehicle section, and unfolding his
arms from the sides. The result is a robot mode that's more accurate than
you'd think. By and large his proportions are quite movie-accurate, with
the exception of his stomach, which should be hanging quite a bit over
his waist but on the toy is rather flat. (Of course, making a robot with
an actual paunch would have been quite the challenge, at least at this
scale with this budget.) His head is also a tad small when compared with
his movie model. There is a bit of vehicle kibble, though-- most notably
on his arms, where there's bits of the shell of his vehicle mode hanging
off his hands and the back end of his elbows. There's also a little bit
extra "vehicle shell" on his foot pieces, but honestly those are small
enough to not really bother me. Hound's mold detailing in this mode is
nothing short of amazing, with things like the copper ammo clips on his
arms, the various details on his chest, the "compressed and fractured metal"
bits on his legs, the wheel-feet, and the fake headlights on his shoulders
all represented quite faithfully. Particularly impressive are his headsculpt--which
is pretty darned movie-accurate, and even has a rubber "wire beard" sculpted
onto the bottom that can move a little when you turn Hound's head from
side-to-side-- and the incredible detail on his lower arms, which look
like they're made of several ammo clips compressed together-- they're also
made of the rubbery, bendy kind of plastic, and his lower arms can rotate
a bit between his elbow and his hands because of this. Thankfully, he ALSO
has a good amount of paint detailing in this mode to highlight all these
details, like the black on his wheel-feet, the silver on the "vehicle fragments"
on his legs, the bronze ammo details on his upper arms, and a silver face
with Autobot-blue eyes. In short, he looks MUCH more interesting in this
mode than in vehicle mode. He also has various little clips and pegs to
hold his many weapons just like in his vehicle mode, though the weapons
you put on his hips can get dislodged quite easily. For articulation, Hound
can move side-to-side at the head, as well as move at the shoulders (at
two points), elbows (at three points), waist rotation, and movement at
the hips (at two points, though movement backwards is severely limited
because of the shape of said hips), knees (at two points), and ankle tilts.
Thus, with all of his weaponry, he's capable of pulling off some pretty
awesome and varied poses (though I wish his heels were just a tad longer
to give him that extra bit of stability).

    AoE voyager Hound has
a lot of really neat details and features-- ammo clips for arms, some unique
robot mode proportions, a "beard", and-- most importantly-- a TON of highly
customizable weaponry that can store in both modes. His vehicle mode is
also almost perfect proportionally. That said, some issues-- such as really
obvious vehicle shell fragments on his arms and a DESPERATE need of more
paint in his vehicle mode-- keep him from reaching the tip-top of the AoE
toyline. (I also miss his beer gut.) Still, a recommendation if you like
the character (i.e., a gung-ho John Goodman) or lots of customizable weapons--
my favorite AoE toy mold of Hound.

      Autobot Hound might only be a single
soldier, but he prides himself on being able to do the jobs of ten. Whether
the objective is a tactical deployment, recon mission, or infiltration
and sabotage, Hound can get the job done. Heavily armored, he isn't about
to back down from an all-out firefight if one comes his way. Some bots
might see that versatility as showing off. To Hound, it's all in the line
of duty.
