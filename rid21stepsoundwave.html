    Soundwave's alternate
mode for RID2015 of a bulky 4WD vehicle is done a bit differently here
than on his other toys-- though then again, pretty much all of the RID2015
toys of Soundwave have some very noticeable differences in vehicle proportions/features.
For this version, Soundwave's front end looks pretty uniform compared to
his other toys, with cockpit windows that are entirely too small, a long
and wide front nose with faux "cassette deck" mold detailing on the front
bumper, a string of three headlights molded in on each side, and two bars
above the roof. The back end is considerably more boxy and is a bit longer
than on his other toys, however, with the roof actually continuing at its
same level all the way back (and actually getting slightly higher for the
port on the top in which you can plug in a Mini-Con Weaponizer or some
other toy with a same-sized handle). There's large side vents next to the
cockpit windows this time around, and the machine gun on one side is de-emphasized
to the point where if he fired it, he'd be partially shooting himself,
it's so "inset"! Nearly all of Soundwave in this mode is a dark navy blue,
but the wheels and back end are a milky red-- which contrasts well, but
looks weird on the back end, having just one section of the car body be
red. (There's some basic bumper details back there, though-- and some basic
armored panel details molded in on the rest of the toy, beyond the details
already mentioned, but nothing all that impressive.) The rear wheel covers,
oddly, are of a blue color that's just a shade or so darker than the rest
of the plastic-- and as far as I can tell, it's not painted either, making
it doubly weird to have this odd color inconsistency back there and only
there. The cockpit windows are painted a dull red, the mouth of the rotary
cannon is gray, and there's a basic dull mustard yellow outline on the
cassette deck details on the front, but unfortunately not any more paint
than that is visible in this mode-- a real shame, as the front bumper and
headlights in particular really needed some more paint to bring out those
molded-in details.

    For his transformation,
Soundwave uses the (by this point) tried-and-true 1-step method of taking
the entire upper "shell" of the vehicle and rotating it all up and behind
the robot mode, plugging it in to the back of the robot waist, and thus
unveiling the robot mode mostly "underneath" the alt mode shell. Then you
just rotate the arms down at the elbows if you want (his only points of
articulation in this mode) and that's it. The end result, like other 1-step
toys that use this transformation method, means there is a HUGE piece of
kibble behind the body-- that is, pretty much the entire top! However,
if you can ignore that big piece of backpack, the tradeoff is a pretty
proportional and accurate (if stiff) portrayal of the robot mode. There's
some extra little flaps hanging off the shoulders, and the wheels hang
off the arms and legs a bit more obviously on this version because of the
smaller size and simple transformation, but other than that this toy fits
the whole "strong yet slim in some parts" look of RID2015 Soundwave on
the show. He's got a wide chest and shoulders, along with somewhat large
(but angular) lower legs, but his waist, upper legs, and parts of his arms
are a bit skinny. His headsculpt is very true to its
    <a href="prisoundwave.html">

    roots, but with a red visor this time, which to me just continues
to not fit the rest of the toy's aesthetic at all, like it was transplanted
from a completely different toy. The hands have some nasty-looking claws
on the end, and the faux cassette-deck details continue on Soundwave's
chest in this mode-- this time more detailed beyond just a dull yellow
outline, with some details on the sides of the chest, as well as some black
paint in the middle, now apparent. There's a fair bit of gray paint on
the front of the lower arms, waist and upper legs, and feet as well, though
I wish it extended beyond just the front to make those pieces look more
like they actually ARE that color at an angle other than directly frontal.
I also wish the gray was a titch lighter to contrast against the dark blue
more.

    If you want a toy of
RID2015 Soundwave that's both A. simple to transform and B. is fairly show-accurate
in robot mode, this is the toy you're looking for. I'd still recommend
the

    more for the fun factor,
but there's no reason to get the more-expensive
