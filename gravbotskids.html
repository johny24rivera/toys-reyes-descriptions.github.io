    Given that Skids' Chevy
Spark vehicle mode is already a little "squished" in its proportions, it
makes the transition to Gravity Bot with relatively little proportion-meddling
in this mode. The front has been squashed in a little but, but that's the
only thing that jumps out at you proportionally. The body is a bit big
proportionally and the windows a bit smaller, but somehow Skids' squat
vehicle mode pulls it off better than the other Gravity Bot alt modes that
have to have their proportions squished up a lot more to fit the Gravity
Bot design. All of the necessary mold details are painted in on Skids--
the windows, the "skidmarks" on the side, the front and back bumpers, it's
all there. No worries about large, boring patches of light green plastic
here. (The light green plastic itself is a rather nice shade, to boot.)
The dark metallic blue used on Skids' windows is a particularly eye-catching
shade and contrasts excellently with the green. The only details that aren't
painted are the lower, smaller head &amp; taillights, but those are hardly
a big detail given how much other paint Skids has on him.

    Like all Gravity Bots,
all you have to do to transform Skids is stand his vehicle mode up on its
back end, and everything flips and folds into place. The roof of the vehicle
mode rotates around to become the robot chest while the front half splits
in half and moves down to reveal the robot head and become shoulders. It's
a nice idea for little kids, even some sacrifices had to be made to Skids'
robot mode to get this to work. For example, just like all the other Gravity
Bots, Skids can't move at all in this mode. However, in stark contrast
to his vehicle mode, the mold detailing on Skids' robot bits is very well-done
and intricate-- particularly the hands, legs, and all the exhaust pipes
'n such on his back (or bottomside of his vehicle mode, if you prefer).
Said mold details are, for the most part, lacking in paint, though. The
fake chest panel is also nicely done, though the sky blue headlights don't
match the actual silver headlights in vehicle mode. The face isn't well-sculpted,
however. I know Skids doesn't exactly have the prettiest mug, but this
sculpt makes it look even uglier, but making it look fat and not highlighting
his nifty gold tooth. Like all Gravity Bots, his arms are rather difficult
to say, hidden on the insides of the front halves of his car mode, which
make up his shoulders.

    Gravity Bot Skids is
one of the better Gravity Bots in terms of general color scheme and his
rather generous amount of paint apps. His face sculpt is ugly, and the
front part of his car mode is a bit too small, but otherwise he's fairly
solid, given the gimmick. I'd still recommend this toy more for little
Skids fans given the easy transformation and complete lack of articulation,
but I could say that about any 'bot in the Gravity Bot subline.
