    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     It's been happening for
a while now; Bumblebee is a popular enough character to need redecos to
keep him on shelves, and an easy way to repaint him while still having
him keep his basic colors is simply to switch them around. Thus, most of
Night Ops Bumblebee- particularly in vehicle mode-- is black (a charcoal,
"impure" black, to be precise), with yellow relegated to the front hood
stripes and grill. In robot mode, the yellow shows through much more, with
quite frankly a ton of yellow paint on his shoulders, lower arms, and chest
in a rather neat fashion-- they're basically yellow with black "borders",
and painted on in a different manner than the original version's paint
apps, and it looks quite good. What looks REALLY good-- and makes the figure
pop, especially in vehicle mode-- is the moderately light blue paint, which
goes extremely well with both the yellow and the black, and is used on
both the headlights and the front and side windows. (Sadly, the rear window
is still left unpainted.) There's also some blue on the eyes in robot mode,
and silver on the face. There is some moderately light milky gray plastic
on the waist, upper legs, tires, and a few other minor parts. Now, I don't
think this color is EXCITING by any means, but I don't think it's as boring
as the blah lighter milky gray plastic-- this is...
     <i>
      acceptable
     </i>
     ,
I guess. I don't like it being on the wheels, though-- having gray wheels
on a black vehicle looks a bit odd.

     No mold changes have
been made to Night Ops Bumblebee.

     RID2015 3-step Night
Ops Bumblebee is an excellent redeco of the character, doing the usual
color-reversal but also adding some unique paint apps (particularly in
robot mode), and some excellent blue on the windows and headlights. I think,
out of various versions of this mold released, this is my favorite that
isn't a Toys "R" Us exclusive. A VERY easy recommendation if you want an
easy-to-transform 'Bee.
