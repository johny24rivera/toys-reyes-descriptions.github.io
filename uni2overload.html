    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Defense Scattorshot.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Defense Scattorshot

     Overload here is a bit
of an enigma. First off, from his bio it's clear he's based off of Armada
Overload... but his packaging says "Cybertron series", even though he never
appeared in Cybertron. Also, his color scheme isn't the slightest bit like
Overload's at all-- it's more of an homage to the G1 Micromaster Flak.
He also doesn't look a thing like Overload when it comes to the mold--
the only similarity between the two forms is that they're both slow-moving
hefty ground vehicles. Regardless, this is a pretty nifty redeco, even
though it's the second mass-release repaint of the figure in the Universe
2.0 line. The camoflauge pattern primarily visible in vehicle mode is REALLY
cool, and helps to make him a bit more visually interesting there. In robot
mode, Overload hardly has a problem there-- he's got TONS of colors on
him, but they all blend together extremely well, given that many of them
are variants on the same general color (i.e., the several shades of green).
The bits red contrasts EXTREMELY well with the green-- particularly the
translucent bits-- even though it's used fairly sparingly. The yellowish-green
also offers a nice contrast against the green, even though it's got a bit
of a greenish tint itself. The gray, black, and gunmetal gray help to give
Overload's robot mode parts a more "metal" look, and the bits of brown
emphasize his military camo-- no one color is out of place, really, and
he's got tons of paint apps, so there's certainly no complaints there.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe 2.0 Overload. Despite the repeated uses of this mold,
the quality hasn't degraded at all, which is quite remarkable.

     Even though the homage
is rather random and nonsensical, Universe 2.0 Overload is a fantastic
mold in an incredible deco. He's brimming with some nice paint apps and
tons of contrasting colors (but not so many that he looks too patchwork
and weird). If you're only going to buy one version of this mold, make
it Overload-- highly recommended.

       Former partner of Optimus Prime, Overload
has since struck out on his own. His past and origins are a mystery, even
to him, and so he left Cybertron, hoping to find answers on one of the
lost colony worlds. He has traveled now for years, battling and destroying
any Decepticons he finds. Mostly, however, he hunts for clues about where
he came from, and who he truly is.
