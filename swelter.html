    Swelter is the last original
Decepticon torpedo Mini-Con mold, though "original" may be a technicality
in this case (more on this later). In torpedo mode, Swelter (COOL name,
by the way) is fairly convincing. The toes out front are quite obvious,
but otherwise he fits the general silouhette of the torpedo Mini-Cons pretty
well. If you look at this mode from the top-down, you can see small gaps
in between what become the robot arms and waist, but they're fairly small
and not that huge of a deal. Now, I will grant that a lot of the "solid-ness"
of this mode comes from the color scheme-- that is, almost the entire mode
is black, with a bit of silver in the center (what becomes the robot abs)
and dull yellow toes, which makes the latter stick out so much. There is
some more dull yellow on the toy, but it's on the bottom of this mode/back
of the robot mode, so it's not readily visible. Other than that, all black,
so the various robot parts seem to "merge" together into the general torpedo
form without any color differentiation. Unfortunately, the downside of
this is that a lot of Swelter's mold detailing is washed out from all that
black-- there's some really cool dual guns molded on the sides of this
mode, as well as a cockpit molded in the front center portion; but again,
no paint. Beyond that, Swelter has some slightly pointy detailing on his
knees and toes, but is otherwise less "pointy" and more simply "angular"
with some minor angular features on the arms, waist, abs, and the "fin"-like
parts near the back that become the robot chest.

    In the transformation
to robot mode, it becomes immediately obvious that Swelter has the same
transformation and design as
    <a href="rid2divebomb.html">
     Divebomb
    </a>
    ;
he's got the same proportions, as well, so many of my comments about Divebomb's
robot mode apply to Swelter; there's obvious and rather ugly little gaps
and bits behind the robot head that are a side effect of the transformation,
and the legs are molded at a bit of a wide stance. That said, Swelter "refines"
the design a bit by not having the appendages be quite so long and spindly,
so the wide stance doesn't look quite as odd. I love the headsculpt; Swelter
has a little "punk" hairdo, with a sneering face (painted silver w/ red
eyes, the only new paint visible in this mode). It's a really unique, evil
"punk" look, though I wish the hair was painted too. The way the chest
slides down also tends to obfuscate the silver paint on the abs, unfortunately.
In one more unique twist, Swelter has a little tail behind him, made out
of the yellow dull plastic. Sadly, as with many RID2015 Mini-Cons, Swelter
has no articulation in this mode; if you try to move the arms or legs inward,
it starts the auto-transformation. Swelter's armor bits are-- as usual--
pretty darn cool, and are all transparent yellow, which looks good against
the black but I wish was a slightly different color to add more variety
to Swelter's color scheme. Nearly all of the armor bits have intricate
"flame" detailing, which of course matches his name. He's got fiery chest
armor with a flip-up fiery mask, little fire bits that stick onto his lower
legs, "exhaust pipes" that stick behind his fists, and the coolest-- flamethrower
effects that attach to the front of his side hand-guns along with a "pipe"
that extends to his upper arms, making it look like he's carrying some
kind of flamethrower backpack. It's a really thoughtful addition, but unfortunately
it's also the most annoying of all his armor pieces, as the peg holes for
them are VERY shallow. They fall off at the drop of a hat, which is a real
shame (along with his lack of ability to actually point the throwers forward).
All of Swelter's armor pieces, thankfully, stay on in torpedo mode.

    Swelter is the same
mediocre Mini-Con design (but NOT mold) of Divebomb, but done a bit better.
The uniform black-ness of the figure-- while blotting out some of the details--
helps unify the torpedo mode much better, and although the transformation
is the same, the appendages in robot mode aren't as long so his stance
isn't quite as odd. The armor pieces look killer, though the flamethrower
pieces fall off probably the easiest out of any RID2015 Mini-Con I own.
Still, this is a decent option if you want to beef up
