    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Movie Dreadwing. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Movie Dreadwing

     Overcast's color scheme
is definitely a bit reminiscient of his name, what with looking somewhat
like a storm cloud and all. Black is pretty much always a great main color
for a transformer, and Overcast is no exception, but what really makes
the toy are all the light contrast colors that just go incredibly well
with the black. The gunmetal gray makes a great secondary color, though
if it were just those two colors Overcast would look pretty dull. Thankfully,
the thunderbolt-ish yellow and Allspark Power electric blue really make
the color scheme pop, used in small amount as they are. (In larger amounts,
either color would admittedly be a bit garish.) Put together, the whole
thing just screams "thundercloud"-- the gray and black for the overcast
cloud, the yellow for lightning, and the blue for rain. It was ingenious
to make the color scheme match his name, or visa versa (whichever was picked
first for the toy).

     No mold changes have
been made to Movie Overcast, though the missiles in Overcast's missile
launchers actually stay in place on mine, as opposed to just firing off
randomly like on my Dreadwing.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Movie Overcast is an
excellent repaint, with the lighter secondary colors playing off the dark
primary color of black to create a great "thundercloud" theme that suits
his name perfectly. Too bad it's one of the worst molds of the entire movie
line, as that fact alone makes me very reluctant to recommend this toy
to anyone except completists.

       Unusually brilliant, Overcast has always
tended to avoid the other Decepticons, preferring instead to work in solitude
on customized weapons systems he installs on his own body. He travels the
galaxy inflicting his inventions on the unsuspecting, and now he has come
to Earth to see how they measure up against the triumphant Autobots. Obscured
behind a cloud generated by his built-in weather-makers, he drops nanite
bombs capable of corroding and destroying even the most advanced machines.
