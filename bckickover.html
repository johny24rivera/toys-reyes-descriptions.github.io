    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Special
Ops Jazz. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     Another former Action
Master gets a transforming toy update! "Kick-Over" is a rather unfortunate
trademark work-around for "Kick-Off"-- as with a name like that he sounds
like he's a "push-over", so I think I'll stick with Kick-Off for the remainder
of this review. Regardless, Kick-Off fits the "Reveal the Shield" Jazz
mold exceptionally well, and the Botcon folks did a wonderful job taking
his general color scheme and replicating it-- with a few extra paint apps--
onto this mold. The white and various shades of red look sharp against
the black, but what really looks fantastic is the fluorescent orange stripe
down the middle of his vehicle mode and also used on his forearms and gun.
It's a REALLY nice shade that unfortunately doesn't photograph well-- this
is one toy that you actually have to see in person to see how nicely it
meshes with everything else. There's also a nice shade of transparent red
used for his windows that goes with his light red plastic, and a few silver
and yellow paint applications to help round things out. Overall there isn't
a large spot on the toy that doesn't have some paint on it-- which is certainly
good, considering the price. There is unfortunately a little bit of that
blah milky gray plastic used on a few minor parts like his gears and that
breaks through to the vehicle mode just a tad-- behind the front wheels--
but this seems to be something that can't be helped, due to the way the
plastic color layouts were apparently set up, and it appears to be the
kind of plastic that you can't paint over easily, so there goes covering
it up.

     Kick-Off has a new head
mold, and it's not the "pre-made" one that came with his fellow exclusive
     <a href="bcsgtreadshot.html">
      Treadshot
     </a>
     --
this was made custom just for this release, and the details are spot-on.
Everything is proportioned just right, painted well, and the details are
all nice and crisp. No complaints here.

     Kick-Over/Kick-Off is
a fantastic redeco of a fantastic mold with a fantastic new head sculpt,
a fantastic number of paint apps that all go together well, and a fantastically
eye-catching shade of orange. He's exceedingly well-done in every aspect
and my favorite exclusive from Botcon 2012-- if you're at all in the market
for Botcon exclusives, this is a must-buy.

       Kick-Over's combat training was earned
in an unconventional manner. As a prisoner held by the Decepticons of Polyhex,
Kick-Over was forced to fight his fellow Autobots in the gladiatorial arena
fondly referred to as "The Greasepit" by their captors. There he gained
in-depth knowledge and experience through intense hand-to-hand combat;
it was learn fast or be terminated. When a power struggle arose amongst
the Decepticon rulers at Darkmount, Kick-Over used the distraction to lead
his fellow prisoners to freedom. His experiences in the gladiatorial pit
have never left his processors, as even now he overheats when he thinks
of pursuing his revenge against his jailers. His distrust of Decepticons
extends to anyone wearing the emblem, regardless of their universe of origin.
Amplifiers on his back combine with his sonic blaster to create deadly
vibrations capable of shaking apart the molecular bonds of solid matter.
