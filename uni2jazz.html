    Jazz' Universe 2.0 figure
is clearly based on his
    <a href="jazz.html">
     original G1 toy
    </a>
    , as is
particularly evident of his vehicle mode, which is pretty much a spot-on
replica of his G1 alt mode but in Legends scale. Jazz has his signature
blue/red stripe going down the center of his vehicle mode, which really
helps break up all the white in this mode and keeps it from looking too
bland. The silvery blue paint on the front and rear windows also contrasts
well with the white, but oddly Jazz' side windows aren't painted. He doesn't
have any of his "Meister" logos or any other paint apps in this mode either,
which can make it look pretty plain from a side view. However, the proportions
are pretty spot on and there aren't any robot mode extras in this mode,
which are certainly two big pluses.

    Jazz' robot mode is
quite good for a Legends figure. Again, it's very reminiscent in design
of his G1 robot mode, with the side windows behind his head/shoulders and
the rear half of the vehicle mode forming his legs. His head sculpt is
spot-on G1, with some great mold and paint detailing there as well as on
the chest. Some nice details are also on his lower chest and waist as well,
and the more prevalent use of black plastic in this mode looks great and
breaks up all the white a lot more than it is in vehicle mode. His proportions
are pretty good in this mode-- the hands are merely molded into parts that
otherwise just form the sides and bottom of his car mode, but other than
that everything seems like "its own part" and not just molded onto the
inside of the vehicle mode like many Legends figures. The inside of his
lower legs is also hollow, but that's a minor beef for something at this
scale. Jazz also has above-average articulation for a Legends toy-- he
can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and ankles.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overall, Universe 2.0
Jazz is one of the best Legends class figures in the line, looking very
solid in both modes and with surprisingly good proportions, particularly
in robot mode. A lack of paint apps on the side of his vehicle mode and
the fact that his arms are molded onto fairly flat pieces of plastic are
his only downsides. Recommended, even if you don't normally go for Legends
figures.
