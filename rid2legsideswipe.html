    Sideswipe's vehicle mode
is another one that's pretty accurate to the show model at Legion scale--
the back third or so is maybe SLIGHTLY larger proportionally than it should
be, but that's a minor quibble. The back end has the robot knees fairly
obvious in the middle, but otherwise there's no robot mode extras in this
mode at all-- well, except for the robot feet on the roof. Though honestly,
these wouldn't be obvious if they weren't painted differently from the
rest of the car mode for no reason other than them being feet, so I'm not
sure if they're quite "extras". They fit in pretty well with the surrounding
parts, and don't add any "kibble" or the like. However, on a class of toys
that typically gets shafted a bit when it comes to paint, I feel Hasbro
could've ignored the minor "black feet" detail from the larger toys and
moved those paint apps somewhere else...? After all, the only other paint
apps in this mode are the metallic black on the windows and the light metallic
silvery blue on the headlights. Otherwise it's all dark red-- it's an okay
color scheme, but a bit dark overall. The mold detailing, as you'd expect
from a toy from this line, is fairly minimal for the size, with only the
"barebones" details on most of the toy and a couple of RID2015-typical
"divots" on places like the rear windows and in front of the rear tires.
All of this said, the front grill is quite well-done, with stylized angular
headlights and bumper. The little spikes on the sides-- though artifacts
from Sideswipe's robot mode-- also look cool, like they're little offensive
weapons to help pop the tires of any enemies following him. The Autobot
"scan sticker" is on the left door, which on this small of a toy is an
obnoxious place to put it, as it kind of inteferes with the solid look
of that door.

    Sideswipe's transformation
is incredibly straightforward-- fold out the back to become the legs and
feet, slide out and down the car doors to make the arms, and fold back
the front section of the car behind the body. Voila, robot mode. Proportionally
this mode is also quite good, EXCEPT for that big honkin' backpack of his
front hood on the back. I mean, it doesn't even TRY to blend in by situating
itself lower behind on the body-- it sticks out right behind and above
his head and shoulders, and partially ruins what is otherwise a fairly
sleek mode. The mold detailing is a bit more impressive in this mode, with
the hands molded into the arms fairly well-- not merely being "2-D hands
on the inside of doors", as is the case with many Legion-class toys. His
feet are accurate, though he has no heels so he's not quite as sturdy as
he otherwise would be. The faux car chest-- complete with painted faux
headlights-- looks nice, as do the painted black "abs" and the headsculpt,
which is molded to have Sideswipe's faceplate up (a rarity for his toys).
Even his tiny eyes have little dots of blue, which is a nice touch. The
color breakup is definitely better in this mode, what with the black plastic
and metallic black paint more prominent, but a few extra paint apps-- perhaps
on the lower legs-- would've still been appreciated. For articulation,
Sideswipe can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and slightly
at the ankles-- above-average for a Legion class toy.

    Sideswipe may not exactly
blow anyone's mind with his "been there, done that" transformation, but
that doesn't mean he's a bad Legion class toy by any means. Indeed, his
vehicle mode is pretty solid, albeit he could use a bit more paint (and
having his toes painted makes them unnecessarily obvious in this mode).
His robot mode is also quite accurate and well-proportioned, with the fairly
large hood-backpack being the only real issue there. Recommended if you
want a tiny version of this design.
