    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original X-Brawn. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original X-Brawn

     Ratchet's color scheme
is that of an Emergency SUV, although there's no real emergency equipment
to be found on him, considering that the mold was originally made for your
average residential SUV. He's got the phrase "Emergency Rescue" plastered
on him here and there, along with some other paint apps, which look especially
nice in his robot mode. That bronze and black just go together amazingly
well. However, the red- which is spraypainted on just one side of the plastic-
looks awful in robot mode because of this, and is also a bit too flat for
my tastes. It's by no means a bad color- it just was applied badly. In
his vehicle mode, Ratchet also has a ladder, a siren, and a fire hose "tattoed"
on his roof- and although it's an extra paint app, it's entirely two-dimensional,
and just looks odd.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although Autobot Ratchet
may have been good on the drawing board, this mold simply wasn't made to
be a rescue vehicle (the 2-D siren, hose, and ladder being a sign of this).
Some of his colors go together really well in robot mode, but overall,
I'd have to rate him slightly below that of the original X-Brawn, since
X-Brawn just managed to pull of his simpler color scheme better.

       Autobot Ratchet tirelessly serves the
Autobot cause; putting his versatile and unequaled medical skills to work
as both a battlefield medic and doctor. He has devoted his career to the
preservation of life in all its forms, and is selfless in protecting humans
from the destruction often caused as a result of the Autobot / Decepticon
war. Autobot Ratchet puts every fiber of his being into his job; extending
his skills to make sure his fellow Autobots are kept as mentally healthy
as possible. As a 4WD Rescue Vehicle, Autobot Rachet can travel over the
roughest terrain and reach speeds up to 140 mph. He is an incredibly skilled
and well-versed doctor, often limited more by time and possible lack of
materials more than anything else. In battle, he's armed with an arc-welder
blaster as well as a battle mace, which also can provide a small-localized
force field shielding its user for brief durations. Autobot Ratchet often
pushes himself to the point of physical exhaustion in performing his duties.
He's usually so caught up in the healing of others, that he neglects his
own maintenance.
