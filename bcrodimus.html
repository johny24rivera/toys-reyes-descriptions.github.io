    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Rodimus. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Rodimus

     Evil Rodimus builds on
a few previous repaints of Rodimus in "evil-esque" colors, with Rodimus'
colors being black, purple, and gray. It's a color scheme that in generally
pretty much always works, and Rodimus is no exception. The light gray,
even with the bits of glitter in it, is extraordinarily dull, however--
a more "metallic" sheen would have looked much better on this toy. The
flames are utterly fantastic, though-- they're not just "Rodimus' flames
in purple" as you'd expect, but a different pattern to the flames altogether--
they look more like gas-fueled flames than wood-fueled flames. Don't ask
me why, but it looks a lot more "eeevil" in its look this way. The dark
red used for the windows and robot eyes is a pretty evil-looking shade
as well, and certainly fits in with the overall colors. The particularly
metallic-looking silver paint that's used on this toy, as well as several
other of the Botcon 2008 exclusives, look good as always, particularly
on the robot face and exhaust pipes. And speaking of the face, it definitely
has Evil Rodimus' defining characteristic-- no actual mold changes were
made to the face, but a bonafied robo-goatee was painted on, and it looks
great, in all its hokey glory. After all, what's a mirror-verse set without
at last one goatee?

     Evil Rodimus has a great
color scheme, and is definitely recommended over his original Classic self,
in my opinion. Yeah, it's not the most original color scheme, but it still
works well-- the only thing I'm not fond of is that dull light gray. The
flames and goatee in particular make the figure.

       Rodimus was once a mercenary who commanded
a team of fellow mercenaries known as "The Wreckers". They plundered resources
across Cybertron and preyed upon the weak. While Rodimus always believed
in Optimus Prime's vision of conquest, he did not want to be a follower.
During the battle of Praxus-Delta, Optimus Prime hired Rodimus' team to
bolster his own forces. In the battle, the Decepticons managed to destroy
every member of the Wreckers except for Rodimus. Despite the heavy losses,
Rodimus wanted to fulfill his contract with Optimus, so he fought on. As
a result, the Autobots were able to retreat that day without further casualties.
Optimus Prime was impressed with Rodimus' fighting ability and asked him
to join the Autobots. Rodimus agreed. He is determined to eventually take
leadership for himself and turn the Autobot forces into the largest mercenary
group the galaxy has ever seen!
