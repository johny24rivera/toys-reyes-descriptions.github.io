    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Depthcharge.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     Sonar repaints the scout
boat mold into something it looked more like in the first place-- a Decepticon.
Black really fits the vehicle mode well, and the dull, moderately dark
blue serves as a nice contrast color to help make the robot mode a bit
more colorful while still keeping the overall "dark" feeling of the color
scheme intact. A bit of silver serves as a nice metallic accent color,
and what little bits of red there are help to "evil it up" even more. (His
face looks even MORE creepy now.) That said, I don't like quite everything
about the new color scheme. For one, the glossy black "camo" patches on
the vehicle mode are so close in color to the regular black plastic that
even under a fairly strong light, it's a bit hard to make them out. Maybe
a more ghostly dark gray would've looked better? Using the silver/black
camo scheme just on the top of Sonar's head looks a little odd, like a
dog or something. Also, although it's a minor thing, a couple of Sonar's
connector pieces in robot mode around the shoulders and knees are an ugly,
off-white, blah shade of plastic that really don't belong in the color
scheme at all.

     No mold changes have
been made to Revenge of the Fallen Sonar.

     Sonar is a great repaint
of a great mold, and he's a cheap purchase, too. There really isn't anything
to not recommend here if you're fan enough of Movie-styled Transformers
to be reading this review.

       If there's one thing Sonar loves, it's
leaving the Autobots all wet. There are so few of them able to pursue him
into the deep ocean that he spends his time taunting them from just off
shore. He can't help but laugh at his latest victim Wideload, who idles,
frustrated and dripping wet, just out of cannon range.
