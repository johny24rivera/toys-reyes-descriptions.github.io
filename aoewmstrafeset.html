       Bumblebee has nearly
the exact same color scheme as the
       <a href="aoelegbee.html">
        solo-packed
legion release
       </a>
       of him in the AoE line (also a Wal-Mart exclusive),
but this time on the superior DotM mold, which makes me wonder why they
didn't use this mold for the other Wal-Mart exclusive release since it
was obviously available. Regardless, see that linked review for my general
thoughts on the colors; in general, I think this is a slight improvement
over the original DotM color scheme of this mold, with the yellow-and-light-blue
colors particularly popping next to each other. There are two small differences
with the paint apps when it comes to this and the solo-packed legion version,
however; this one has a robot face detailed with some dark glossy gray,
as opposed to the white of the solo-packed toy. This change I like, since
it's more movie-accurate and contrasts better. However, the paint apps
have been skimped on slightly more for this version, with the rear window
not being painted on this version and there being no black paint along
the side rims, either.

       No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee, though he does come with the same
light transparent red blaster that
       <a href="pricybee.html">
        Prime legion
Bumblebee
       </a>
       came with-- though he can't store it in vehicle mode, unfortunately.

         Stinger, on the other
hand, takes the same color scheme as the
         <a href="aoelegstinger.html">
          solo-packed
legion release
         </a>
         AND the same mold, and only changes up the placement
of the black paint apps a bit. In vehicle mode, this version lacks the
"V" stripes on the hood, but the sides look more interesting, with a three-striped
"sunray" sort of pattern eminating from the front wheel on each side as
opposed to the solid stripe on the solo-packed version. In robot mode,
the feet aren't painted black, but the lower legs below the knees are instead.
Aaand... that's really it, so see the earlier linked review for my thoughts
on the general color scheme and mold itself. Otherwise the core toy is
exactly the same for this release as for the solo-packed version.

        <font face="OCR A Extended">
         No mold changes have
been made to this version, but like with Bumblebee, Stinger comes with
a transparent purple Prime Cyberverse-scaled weapon-- a sword, in this
case. Unlike Bumblebee, Stinger CAN store it in his vehicle mode, though.

             This three-pack release
by Wal-Mart is pretty pointless, given their other exclusives. You've got
a Strafe that's the same as the mass release; a Bumblebee that looks pretty
much the same as the solo release, but with a slightly different mold;
and a Stinger that uses the same ill-fitting Prime Knock Out mold, with
only a few minor paint changes and two additional weapons. If you want
all three of these toys and don't have either the mass-release Strafe OR
the solo-packed legion versions, this is a recommended pick up since it's
basically the same price as buying all three individually but with a better
Bumblebee mold and additional weapons; otherwise, this set is an easy pass
for all but the most hardcore completists.
