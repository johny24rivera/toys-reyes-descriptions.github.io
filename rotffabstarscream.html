    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Battle Blade Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Battle Blade Starscream

     The RotF redeco of the
Fast Action Battler mold gives Starscream a darker, more movie-accurate
appearance. His color, as opposed to being tan, is now appropriately gray
as it should be, though perhaps just a SHADE too dark to be called "movie-accurate".
Those sweet "tattoos" all over his body really make this toy stand out,
though, as it does on pretty much every other version of RotF Starscream.
Here they seem to be a bit more detailed, though, sometimes with little
"Cyberglyphic" tattoos INSIDE the black tattoos! Pretty cool. In robot
mode he gains even more paint apps with some nice silver tats on his arms
and a silver-painted head with more black tats. Starscream's head already
looked wicked, but not it looks REALLY evil-- in blatant comparison to
his more kid-friendly FAB body, of course. The light red and purple bits,
while rare, also go quite well with the gray.

     Sword Slash Starscream
is a great repaint, with tons of paint apps all over and great "tattoo"
paint apps to help cover up the rather dull gray that makes up most of
his coloration. However, it's hard to ignore the fact that yes, it is the
horrible FAB Starscream mold, no matter how awesomely you paint it. Save
your money and get one of the larger RotF Starscream releases instead.
