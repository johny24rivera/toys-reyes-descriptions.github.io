    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Revenge of
the Fallen Deluxe class Jolt. For a review on the mold itself, read the
review of the original RotF Deluxe class Jolt

     Electrostatic Jolt is
another one of those "repaints" of a movie character that's mostly the
same, and mostly created just to keep a character from the movie on toy
shelves. Electrostatic Jolt's main color scheme of dark blue is pretty
much the same, though parts of his robot mode and the rear part of his
car mode have been changed for this release-- a bit more than usual with
these kind of "variant repaints". In vehicle mode, Jolt has some pretty
neat "electric bolt" paint apps along his lower sides, leading to a light
silver blue paint job on his back end in that mode, which helps to add
some variety and just plain looks nice, to boot. There's a bit more color
variation in robot mode, as well-- there's considerably more brownish-gold
plastic on this version than on the original, and a pretty nice pale shade
of periwinkle goes quite well with the dark blue (and contrasts well with
the gold). That said, the removal of the electric blue from the mold makes
him look distinctly less "electrostatic" in robot mode. The transparent
color is also now a rather pale purple, which is a lot less eye-catching
and ignorable than the original's aquamarine.

     No mold changes have
been made to Electrostatic Jolt.

     Electrostatic Jolt has
a more varied color scheme than "vanilla Jolt", and some really nice electricity
paint apps along the side of his vehicle mode as well. I'm not fond of
the complete removal of light electric blue from the color scheme-- and
the shade of transparent plastic on this version is dull-- but overall,
I think this version wins over the original's colors.

       Jolt has no idea how he managed facing
off a Decepticon as powerful as Payload, but now that he's here, he won't
back down. With Autobot Ratchet by his side, the odds are almost even.
His tactics of confusion and distraction should disrupt the evil robot's
headlong charge long enough for a stunning electro-whip attack. Then he
and Autobot Ratchet can move in to finish off the Decepticon courier.
