    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original version of
Weaponizer Dragonus. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Boy, Dragonus just can't
figure out what side he wants to be on, can he? First a
     <a href="dragonus.html">
      Decepticon

     ,
than an Autobot for his first Weaponizer version, and now back to a Decepticon
again! Make up your mind, dude! Anyways, This is basically Dragonus but
in more "evil" colors than the version that he came in in the 4-pack; his
main plastic color is black, with some purple plastic on the four pieces
that connect his wings to his main body and some dark metallic purple paint
on the top of his two main blasters on the front. It's a well-tested color
scheme, but there's a reason for that; it works pretty well. Both colors
contrast excellently with each other, though I wish there was a bit more
purple paint to help break up the contrast a bit more on, say, his dragon
body. He's also got some red for his eyes, which helps them stand out against
all the face details on the black plastic around them.

     No mold changes have
been made to the core toy, but since the 4-pack version didn't come with
any transparent armor pieces, this one comes with the same armor pieces
that came with the original (non-Weaponizer) Dragonus. Unfortunately, they
don't fit thematically as well with the toy, now that he's all right angles
and fairly robotic, whereas many of his armor pieces (like his helmet,
claws, and small wing parts) looked more organic like his original version.
It also means he has the two hind legs for an animal armor combiner that
you can't form, given they stopped doing those after Wave 2 of the Mini-Con
single packs. The pieces DO seem to fit better into their slots than on
the original, at least on my copy-- no little wing pieces constantly falling
out of their holes, here. The color used for the transparent pieces is
a bit odd, being a kind of slightly greenish yellow... honestly, it looks
like urine yellow, if I'm being brutally honest. It contrasts against the
black well enough, but a more straightforward yellow-- or making them something
like green or red-- would've looked better overall, I think.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The single-packed version
of Weaponizer Dragonus is the best version of one of the best Mini-Con
molds. It's a solid toy overall, and now in a great black-and-purple color
scheme. I wish he had new armor parts to better fit his new look-- and
that the new parts were a different shade of yellow that looked less urine-y--
but overall he's a very easy recommendation, if you can find him. I say
"if you can find him" because this toy was in the second wave of single-packed
Weaponizers, which was quite difficult to find outside of a few countries
like Canada, so you may have to pay a premium for him, in which case it's
probably not worth it.
