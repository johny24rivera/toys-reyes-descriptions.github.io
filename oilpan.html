    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Brakedown.

     Oil Pan's a new-character
redeco, and features a primarily orange paint scheme, with a dull bluish
purple color serving as the main accent color in robot mode. It's certainly
a rather unique scheme, and the colors complement each other well, with
neither being too loud-- though on that subject, I wish the bluish purple
wasn't QUITE so pale, so as to provide just a tad more contrast. The black--
used mostly for the wheels, and windows-- serves as a decent neutral color,
particularly in vehicle mode to keep the whole theme from getting too "light"-looking.
The white stripes in vehicle mode help Oil Pan from looking too one-tone
in vehicle mode as well, and given the exact tones of the orange and white,
ends up reminding me a bit of a creamsicle in that mode. The white also
works marvelously on the few places it's used on the robot mode, like the
chest and the head-- particularly the latter, as, combined with the red
eyes, the mold detailing, and the darker head, makes Oil Pan's face look
a bit like a evil helmeted skeleton (certainly appropriate for a Movieverse
Decepticon). The other bits of painted color-- the silver on the headlights
and hubcaps, the red on the taillights, and the gunmetal gray near the
rear of the vehicle mode-- serve as decent colors to help break up all
the orange, but color-wise I don't think they add anything to the deco
job that the black and/or white didn't already.

     Oil Pan is a fairly
nice, unique paint scheme on a mold that's sadly medicore at best. Given
that he's not in any fiction and doesn't have any real characterization,
I imagine most people won't find quite the draw to him compared to RotF
Brakedown, but compared to that initial iteration of this mold, I DO think
this one's color scheme is slightly better.

       Oil Pan is used to running, and he's
become quite good at it over the years. He's the ultimate defensive driver--
using traffic as a shield against Autobot laser fire, and disappearing
down exit ramps before his pursuers even realize where he's gone. The pair
of Autobots chasing him may think he's trapped, but he'll be away and free
before they know it.
