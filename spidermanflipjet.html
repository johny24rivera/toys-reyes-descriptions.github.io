    This version of Spider-Man's
alternate mode is a jet! You can tell because of the wings at the side
and the... well, okay, just the wings, really. As with pretty much every
toy in this "Flip and Attack" subline-- based upon the original Jumpstarters
TFs from G1-- the vehicle mode looks like the mech mode with its legs folded
up and the toy on its back, first and foremost. That said, because of said
wings, at least it's still a bit easier to tell exactly WHAT type of vehicle
it is, whereas many of the ground-based alt modes in this subline are big
question marks. The overall color scheme takes Spider-Man's red into account,
but most of the "jet" parts that are more visible in this mode are silver.
The colors go together nicely enough, though I'm quite surprised that all
of Spider-Man's silver on the toy is actually PAINTED (or at least it looks
very much like it's painted), as opposed to being a semi-metallic (or even
worse, flat) shade of gray that we're supposed to accept as silver. Anyways,
it certainly makes this version of Spider-Man high on paint apps, and the
stripes and "Spider-Man" parts seem to be additional paint apps to boot.
The light pastel blue used for the cockpit (which doesn't extend out nearly
as much as it should-- and the body of the jet itself is huge, but again,
Flip and Attack toy, here) is also a pretty nice shade of the color and
contrasts with the red excellently.

    As for the mech mode--
to transform him, wind Spider-Man back in his vehicle mode on a flat surface
until you hear a clicking sound on the wheels, then let it go-- the legs
will flip forward abruptly a couple seconds later, the weight and torque
of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Spider-Man stand up into his
mech mode on his own. It only seems to happen about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time
in my experience, though-- the other times he just unfolds and rockets
forward a bit to clatter around on his front or backside. It's pretty cool
when done right, though. In mech mode, Spider-Man looks much more recognizable
as to what it's supposed to be-- a big Spider-Man mech-- and there's plenty
of mold detailing to show, like the "thrusters" on the undersides of the
feet, the metal arms molded onto the insides of the wing-parts, and the
pistons and wires connected to the back side of the very well-sculpted
Spider-Man face at the top. The Spider-Man signature "web" pattern is also
very apparent on his mech parts, though comparatively his jet parts are
rather sparsely detailed. Spider-Man suffers the usual ailments of toys
in this line in terms of having overly large feet for the gimmick-- though
this is excusable, for me. What isn't excusable, in my opinion, is restricting
his articulation to only back-and-forth at the shoulders (and technically
forward at the hips as part of the transformation, but they snap back into
place as soon as you let go of them). Not even his head can move, and elbow
articulation would also have been appreciated (though I understand why
his legs have to basically stay bolted together for the gimmick to work).

    The jet version of "Flip
and Attack" Spider-Man is, in my opinion, the best out of the
    <i>
     Amazing
Spider-Man
    </i>
    releases in the subline, primarily due to the fact that
the gimmick makes for more recognizable jets than other vehicles. The fact
that he looks like he's completely painted is another plus, though he still
suffers from the same downsides that the other toys in the subline have
due to the gimmick (i.e., almost non-existent articulation, large feet,
and a pretty weak/funky vehicle mode).
