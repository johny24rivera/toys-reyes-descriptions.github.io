    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" deluxe Wheeljack. For a review on the mold itself, read the

     Like most of the Beast
Hunters Autobots &amp; Decepticons, Wheeljack's upgrade involved him getting
a very "amped up", Mad Max-style vehicle mode with some beast elements--
in Wheeljack's case, he takes on a bit of a jagged, feathery appearance.
The core mold is the same as his original Prime toy, but nearly every piece--
particularly in vehicle mode-- has been retooled with jagged, armor-like
detailing. This is particularly impressive on the vehicle front (or robot
legs), with spikes poking out not just on the sides, but up the middle
of the hood too. There's also some angular "feathers" on the sides of his
car doors and longer, similar protrusions along his back end. In keeping
a bit more with the slightly more "organic" feel of the Beast Hunters upgrades,
Wheeljack's robot mode also has some bony "spine protrusions" down his
back, and his headsculpt is a bit more spiked-out and "feathered". The
long feathers on the back end in vehicle mode become a nice, pretty darned
cool "cape" in robot mode, but there are two downsides to this; first,
the pieces inhibit some arm movement a little, and second, they don't leave
Wheeljack with a convincing back end at all in vehicle mode-- his main
body just sort of... tapers off into the feathers. Thankfully, if you keep
Wheeljack's main weapon plugged into its port on the top of vehicle mode,
it helps to cover up this gap in the back on all but a few rear angles.
In robot mode, Wheeljack's weapon folds out into an impressive staff for
him to grip, which has a long, well-detailed spear at the end that can
also shoot a disc if you pull back rapidly on the spear's head. The disc
itself can even open up, becoming more of a "capture" disc that fits in
well with the whole "Beast Hunters" theme. On a negative note, however,
with all these new accessories Wheeljack's tires have become clip-on instead
of pinned in. This doesn't bother me personally, but I've seen that quite
a few people dislike this, so it's worth mentioning.

     Wheeljack's color scheme
hasn't changed much for his Beast Hunters version-- he's still mostly white
and black with red and green detailing. The paint detailing is considerably
more pronounced this time though, particularly in vehicle mode, where pretty
much every spike is either red, green, or bronze. His red is a bit lighter
and more apparent-- in large amounts the red admittedly looks a bit blah,
but otherwise I like it. Another minor change is that Wheeljack's transparent
plastic is a more straight tint and not blue, which I find a slightly negative
change but overall it's no big deal. The major color change is that Wheeljack's
gray has been replaced with a bronzish brown color, which I find a positive
change as it brings a bit more color to both modes (and gray is waaay overused
on TFs anyways). To help get in some extra coloration without more actual
paint apps, some black plastic has been mixed in with certain bits of his
light red and white plastic. Normally, I like this on the Beast Hunters
toys it's used on-- it's a nice, new thing for Transformers toys, and generally
looks rather pretty. Black mixed in with white and light red, though, just
makes both of the colors look dirty, and not in a cool "battle worn" type
of way. I would've preferred it if the mixed plastic had been left out
of Wheeljack.

     Wheeljack has one of
the best "Beast Hunters" upgrades-- yes, he still uses the same base mold
and design, but all his added "feather" spikes are really darned cool,
his robot mode "cape" is a nice touch, and his weapon is quite impressive
and fun. I wish he had a more substantial back end to his vehicle mode
and that he didn't have black mixed in with some of his light red and white
plastic, but otherwise, this is an ace design and a great example of all
I find awesome about the Beast Hunters upgrades to the Autobots and Decepticons.
Highly recommended, even if you have the original.

        Wheeljack is willing to admit that he
didn't think much of the idea that some kind of ancient Cybertronian arsenal
was hidden in this solar system's asteroid belt. But now that the pitted,
timeworn hulk of what is obviously a very old starship fills his view screen,
he's got to say he's impressed. What's more, his sensors detect vast reserves
of power in the old ship's hold. When he and Bumblebee go aboard, neither
of them is surprised when they find dozens of crates filled with strange
weapons. Unfortunately, they are surprised when they turn to begin loading
their ship, only to find Megatron and Predaking blocking their way.
