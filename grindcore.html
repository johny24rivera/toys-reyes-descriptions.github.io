    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Landmine. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Landmine

     Though his name is taken
from a form of extremely heavy metal music, Grindcore is an homage to the
obscure Micromaster Crush-Bull. He has the traditional "light green" that
accompanies many Transformer construction vehicles, though instead of purple,
which I suppose would make him look too much like a Constructicon homage
and thus too "Decepticon-y", gray is his secondary color. And even though
it's been done a lot, I honestly would have preferred a Constructicon homage,
because the gray just does not contrast with the light green well, and
looks a tad bland, to be honest. The black used on Grindcore's wheels would
have made a better color in place of the gray parts, or some other darker
color, but the gray as it is just doesn't do it. The rusty brown paint
app do look nice-- I especially like how they're used with the silver on
the front of the shovel to make it look worn-- but again, it's not quite
dark enough to create real contrast. Probably the nicest-looking part of
Grindcore when it comes to his color scheme is his face, with his a nice
mix of the green, silver, rusty brown, and light blue optics, which all
come together surprisingly well, probably because there's just as much
silver as green, which helps with the contrast of the other colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Grindcore, though his Cyber Key has been replaced with the
traditional "translucent red" Cyber Key that is used on many other Cybertron
toys that were turned into Movie line exclusives. Oh, and his shoulders
come screwed in the wrong way, though it's not really that big of a deal,
considering it can take a bit of effort to get them on the right way.

     Grindcore is a good
mold, and although his color scheme isn't horrible, it's made almost entirely
of light colors, which doesn't give the toy enough contrast-- using gray
as a secondary color just makes him look a bit dull, as well. I'd recommend
Landmine slightly over this guy, even if Landmine's color scheme isn't
all that hot either.

       Whatever Grindcore is doing, he loves
to do it loud. Cybertron was always a pretty noisy place, what with everyone
revving their engines, and then the war. Earth people really know how to
make noise fun though. Human heavy metal is way cooler than the shock-pop
he listened to in his home city of Vos. It's easy to find him on any construction
project Â– just follow the incredibly loud music.
