    Rollbar is the sportscar
that Shane drove briefly in the movie-- apparently for rally racing, and
it was really decked-out to the point where I was surprised it WASN'T a
Transformer in the movie. Well, Hasbro has rectified that oversight in
the movie by making a toy that transforms into said car! As you'd expect
from a licensed Chevrolet alt-mode, the proportions here are pretty good,
with only a few minor compromises made because of the transformation--
most notably at the front end, where the windshield doesn't slope up as
quickly as it should and is a little narrow. There's also the unsightly
hinge lines along the front hood that are a byproduct of the transformation.
Other than that, and obviously not having seats inside when you look inside
his open side windows, Rollbar is extra-free in this mode. The mold detailing
is fairly sparse on most of the car-- as is accurate to the speedy rally
car used in the movie-- but there are parts that are appropriately detailed
fairly intricately, such as the back end (what with the license plate,
taillights, front bumper, exhaust pipes and all), the front end, and the
tires, especially. The general color scheme of white and purple looks really
good and is a bit abnormal for an Autobot, but it still looks good, and
the bit of dark metallic grayish blue used for the windows also contrasts
excellently with the white. The way the purple swoops down from the spoiler
to the side and then "fades out" in a checkered pattern is quite unique,
and makes Rollbar stand out on a movie shelf. (That said, the bit of purple
plastic in the middle of the front grill looks kinda weird.) There's a
bit of silver on the headlights and gold/yellow used on the Chevrolet symbols
on the front grill and the back end, but there still definitely needed
to be more paint on the front and back end. The grill on the the front
is unpainted, and with the exception of the Chevy symbol, the back end
is COMPLETELY unpainted, which is a crying shame given all the mold detailing
back there just begging for some paint. There's also no fake sponsor logos
either, but I consider that a minor complaint compared to the aforementioned
oversights.

    Rollbar uses the nifty
"switchblade" style of one-step transformation first used in toys like
    <a href="aoe1stepdrift.html">
     Drift
    </a>
    ,
where you pull out and rotate the sides of the mode down, and the rest
of the toy automatically changes into robot mode. As such, he shares nearly
all of the same pros and cons in his robot mode design that the other "switchblade
one-step" Transformers have. On the plus sude, Rollbar looks pretty good
from the front proportionally, but from a side view looks quite odd, with
his legs far too "deep" and actually going almost all the way up to his
head, concealed in the front by the chest flap of "fake" robot detailing.
Said legs are also hollow from the side, and just plain look bad. Just...
don't look at the toy from the side in this mode. That major downside out
of the way, Rollbar has a pretty good look in this mode, with his chest
having several nice asymmetrical mold details on it, like a gas cap on
the right side of the chest and what look like angled fragments of his
car mode on the left side, and with what looks like the hood "air vent"
in the middle of his chest-- a nice look. His headsculpt is also really
well-done-- again, slightly asymmetrical what with looks like a (literal)
headlight on the right side of his forehead, but otherwise a silver faceplate
for a mouth below deep-set eyes and a round purple helmet. The mold details
on his arms and legs are sadly rather generic with only a few pistons 'n
such visible, though the backside of this mode-- the underside in the car
mode, so it's almost never "seen"-- has some angular robotic detailing,
as well. Rollbar's also armed with daggers that apparently come right out
of his knuckles, Wolverine-style, on each hand. The white and purple are
broken up pretty well in this mode, with the purple being a bit more evident
here, particularly with the purple paint on the chest, hips, and head.
The silver in the middle of the chest and head also helps to break up the
white and add a bit more variety to the color scheme, and the black "V"
shape behind the head is a nice little accent as well-- no complaints here.
Unfortunately, like all 1-step changers with this transformation scheme,
Rollbar can only move at the shoulders at two points and outwards sideways
slightly at the legs (the latter due to his transformation)-- otherwise
he's a brick.

    Rollbar is a pretty
good-looking one-step changer, all things considered, though he suffers
from the same side-view issues in robot mode that all AoE TFs with the
"switchblade" transformation scheme have. Mildly recommended if you want
a toy of the character that isn't "just" a redeco of someone else but a
brand new mold, of if you don't want to purchase an expensive giftset to
obtain some version of him-- he's one of the more unexpected additions
to the AoE line.
