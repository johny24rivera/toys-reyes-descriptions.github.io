    Snarl's stegosaurus mode
is certainly very spiky-- as you'd expect an AoE Dinobot to be-- with the
plates and tail spikes expectedly spiky, but many other bits edged and
pointy too, like the undersides of his tail, the ridges on his neck and
upper legs-- heck, Snarl looks like he's made almost solely out of triangles.
Not that that's a bad thing, mind you; I love the "wigged out dinosaur"
modes most of the AoE Dinobots have, and Snarl is no exception. Nearly
all of his mold detailing looks like angular interlocking pieces of armor,
with a TON of triangles in particular on Snarl's plates. That said, I don't
like how much of Snarl's plastic is transparent; on the plates it looks
okay, but on the sides of the main body? On the tail? It looks a bit odd
and

    </a>
    , and in a bad
way. It doesn't fit with the rest of the AoE Dinobots, who are solid-colored.
That said, the proportions on Snarl are pretty spot-on in this mode, and
considerably better than his overly-wide
    <a href="aoepbsnarl.html">
     Power
Battler version
    </a>
    . There are a few robot mode extras, but the only obnoxious
ones are the painfully obvious robot hands on the back end of his rear
feet. There's also the bottom of his robot feet and just a bit of his robot
hips visible near the front bottom and on the sides of the main body, but
they're minor at best, given how well they blend into the surrounding parts.
My biggest issue with this mode has to do with one of Snarl's weapons--
one is formed by taking his largest two plates and folding them out for
a large handheld blade weapon in robot mode, but they're made of transparent
plastic, and the tab you're supposed to slot them in in this mode is also
transparent plastic. Soooo it doesn't tab well in. At all-- just a tiny
bit of shaking and the big plates will tumble off the figure. VERY annoying.
The yellowish-green shade of the transparent plastic both contrasts and
complements the somewhat light jungle green used for most of the main body,
with the brownish gray of the lower front legs and neck-- and a few black
paint apps, like on the lower back legs-- helping to give the color scheme
at least a little bit of dark contrast to the color scheme. Snarl also
has a pretty good amount of paint in this mode, with much of the aforementioned
transparent plastic on his main body painted a metallic light green that
looks the same as the solid green plastic at a first glance, but is actually
just a tad lighter and glitterier. For articulation in this mode, Snarl
can move at the base of the neck, at the jaw, at the shoulders and knees
of the front legs, and at the knees at two points on the back legs (sorry,
no hip articulation, unfortunately, due to his transformation). His tail,
unfortunately, can't move, either. So he's passable in this respect in
dino mode, but just so.

    Snarl's transformation
to robot mode takes some cues from his G1 version, with the front of the
dino mode forming the legs while the tail splays out behind his back and
the rear dino legs form the arms. In robot mode Snarl looks like a bonafide
bruiser, as it should be-- he's got a broad chest and some broad shoulders,
rather large lower legs in comparison to his upper legs, and fairly meaty
arms (though having the lower arms hollow just looks bad). I do love how
the tail and plates splay out behind his back, making him look much more
individualistic, but they do severely limit shoulder articulation. Having
them mostly solid in this mode would've looked better too, me thinks. The
front dino legs stick out from the sides of the lower legs and don't lock
into place, unfortunately, which is a minor annoyance. I do love that--
since you fold Snarl's dino head into the interior of his right leg-- there's
also a fake mold-detailed duplicate stegosaurus head on the interior of
his other leg, too! That was a really cool, unnecessary little detail (though
I do wish the fake head was painted to better match the "real" head). Few
of Snarl's parts are visible in this mode that aren't in beast mode, but
the robot chest and waist is well-detailed, both in terms of the "overlapping
armor" mold detailing that looks semi-organic in this mode, and the extra
paint apps on said chest-- the addition of metallic purple looks lovely
in comparison to the green, and the silver on the sides of the abs look
ace, as well. That said, he needs more coloration-- particular of the silver
or purple kind-- on the rest of his body, as there's just way too much
unbroken green that isn't as obvious in beast mode because of all the transparent
plastic. I'm also not fond of Snarl's headsculpt-- it's the least "knight-ish"
of all the AoE Dinobots', though at least Snarl has the same "pointy shoes"
as the rest of his team. He has a rather ugly gritted-teeth mouth, with
odd-looking eyes and little spikes coming off the back end. I don't mind
that last bit, but the whole thing looks like he's constipated or something.
Snarl's weapon is made by combining his tail and largest plates into a
handheld blade weapon, which admittedly looks pretty darned cool and, obviously,
can be held in either of his hands. As far as articulation goes, he can
move at the neeck, shoulders (at three points-- restricted quite a bit
going back because of the plates behind the shoulders), elbows, wrist rotation,
and movement at the hips, knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points).
I really wish his lower arms had a bit more movement-- and waist rotation
wouldn't have hurt-- but he still passes in this respect.

    AoE Snarl isn't the
best AoE Dinobot design there is, but he's still a fairly solid toy, with
a really unique look, tons of spikes and plates everywhere, and pretty
nice proportions in both modes with largely minimal kibble (the kibble
that he does have in robot mode I feel "frames" that mode nicely). His
main weaknesses come in terms of his robot head sculpt, color variety,
and articulation (for a mainline deluxe), but he's still a mildly recommended
buy if you want to fill out your AoE Dinobot ranks.

      Snarl lives up to his name. If you see
