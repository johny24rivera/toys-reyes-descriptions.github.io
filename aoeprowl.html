    Prowl? Well, there's
a left-field choice. Not a redeco, and not a Transformer who even had a
vehicle mode that appeared in the movie. Regardless, in vehicle mode Prowl
looks pretty
    <a href="g1prowl.html">
     G1-ish

    , but with a slightly more
aerodynamic, "modern" flair-- the windshield is rather slanted and doesn't
come above the main body of the vehicle as much as it should, but it's
not SO bad it looks egregious. The angled red light bar and the spoiler
on the back end only enhance the streamlined look of the toy, along with
the fact that much of the vehicle mode is relatively un-detailed in terms
of the mold itself (though a couple of places--like the tires and front
grill-- have a pretty good number of small details). There aren't any robot
mode extras in this mode whatsoever, always a plus. The amount of paint
is actually rather generous in this mode for a 1-step changer, with the
entire bottom three-fourths or so of the main body coated in a nice glossy
black paint, along with the usual Prowl "swoop" that is at the front of
the hood. The front and back windows are also painted glossy black, too
(the side windows are hollow), and the headlights are painted silver. It
all makes this mode look far from boring, despite the fact that Prowl has
an almost entirely monochromatic color scheme. Prowl also has an Autobot
symbol along with "POLICE" along his sides, in a simplified format of his
G1 logos (omitting the "Highway Patrol" and little blue-and-yellow shield).
That said, the black paint on the bottom three-fourths of the body covers
just about EVERY detail down there, including details it shouldn't-- such
as the tailpipes and the license plate on the back end. The taillights
are also devoid of paint, as well. Due to the transformation, there's also
some ugly creases in his front hood, and the middle of his front bumper
is oddly white, standing in stark contrast to the black parts around it.

    Prowl uses the same
"switchblade" transformation as several other AoE 1-steppers, with you
rotating the back sides of the vehicle down and everything else automatically
unfolding into robot mode. He has the same general issues as other 1-step
switchblade-formers-- that is, when looked at from the side he's mostly
hollow and it's quite obvious his legs go almost up to his neck, with his
actual legs too fat proportionally from a sideview and it clear that his
robot "chest" is just a flap covering up the gap in between his legs from
a front view. Thus, it's recommended just not to look at Prowl from a side
view in this mode. His overall look seems to be a slightly "movie-ized"
incarnation of Prowl's classic design-- he's got the rear of the vehicle
mode for legs, a faux police car front for his chest, and faux (and very
under-sized) car doors behind his head, which itself is pretty much his
classic G1 headsculpt but with a few extra lines on the silver face. Still,
though, he'd easily fit in a "Classics" or "Generations" collection in
a pinch. There still are a few "movie-like" details on him, though, such
as the mold detailing that looks liked curved metal bits on his upper legs,
and the mold detailing on his backside looks vaguely Bumblebee-like in
its general detailing and foot design, even if that doesn't come through
on the front. Prowl's color scheme is pretty much the same in this mode
as in vehicle mode, but with a bit more white-- though he's still got a
good number of paint apps, like the light red on his chest and forehead
crest, a silver face, and some black on the faux grill on his chest and
on the upper legs (in addition to the aforementioned black on his rear
windows). His arms could really use some paint detailing, though-- with
the nice mold detailing on them, the only paint is on the sword sticking
out of one of his knuckles for some weapon action, which is painted a nice
sky blue. For articulation, Prowl can only move at the shoulders at two
points-- just like every other regular-sized 1-step changer "switchblade-former".

    A Prowl design is a
rather nice surprise for a movie line, though I personally wish they had
made him a bit more "movie-esque" and less like his G1 design to give a
bit more individuality to the toy. As is, this is one of the few movie
toys I'd recommend to those who even hate the movie aesthetic, as it basically
is a G1 1-stepper toy. If you've got a young one who wants a simple-to-transform
Prowl... well, here you go. As far as comparing him to the rest of his
1-step subline friends, though, he's fairly average.
