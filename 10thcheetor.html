    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Cheetor. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Cheetor is one of the
'bots to get pretty much no change for his 10th Anniverary Edition. The
only noticeable change is the silver-and-red Maximal symbol on his right
shoulder in beast mode, though there are a few more subtle changes. Namely,
The blue used for his paint apps is a bit shinier and more metallic than
on the toy's previous versions. The black paint lines on the face are also
considerably thinner than on the toy's previous versions. Also, the overall
color scheme is a mix between the mold's original color scheme and its
     <a href="cheetor99.html">
      Fox Kids repaint version
     </a>
     -- it has the more
muted blue and golden yellow colors of the Fox Kids version, but the black
spots of the original. I'm kind of miffed that Cheetor's feet, eyes, and
lower arms aren't yellow, since that's how he looked on the show and the
entire POINT of the 10th anniversary repaints was to make them very show-accurate,
but he still is a slightly better match to the show model than the previous
paint jobs.

     No mold changes have
been made to 10th Anniversary Cheetor.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     If you have any previous
versions of this toy, or have no big desire to complete Transmutate, than
10th Anniversary Cheetor definitely isn't worth your $15. Otherwise, he's
a fairly good toy with the most show-accurate paint job the toy has had
yet, and is a nice reminder of times gone by.

       The youngest of the Maximal crew, Cheetor
is fiery, impulsive, and just plain dumb sometimes. Youthful overconfidence
combined with incredible speed can quickly get him into deep trouble from
which he lacks the skill to escape. Still, beneath his reckless desire
to impress his fellow Maximals is the heart of an honorable and capable
warrior, and great potential as a future leader.
