    Wow, Megatron as a fairly
realistic pistol again?! Whoda thunk? Well, Hasbro was able to get away
with it since this time he's far smaller than any real gun, being pint-sized
and all. Even still, they had to give him a "safety orange" tip (given
that, I'll ignore the obvious clashy orange in terms of reviewing his color
scheme, since that was likely mandatory by law). In terms of proportions
for this mode, Megatron is surprisingly spot-on, particularly for this
size. The handle's a bit fat, and there's a bit of a gap on the backside
of the gun-- other than that, he looks pretty darn good. The mold detailing
is all there too, though he's missing a trigger, likely given a combination
of the small size and to prevent any more safety regulations from hampering
the toy. The color scheme is pretty realistic for a gun as well, being
black and gray primarily. Normally this would be a bit on the boring side,
but three things-- first, it's accurate to the G1 toy; second, it's a small
toy, so relatively "large" areas of the same color don't matter as much;
and third, a lot of the gray is painted silver, which pretty much always
looks great and superior to a normal gray. There are a few robot mode extras
visible in this mode-- you can see the detailing for his stomach on one
side of the gun, as well as one of his hands poking out the backside of
the gun and the back of his head folded down against the top of the gun.
Really, though, for a toy this size and with this alt mode, it's still
pretty impressive even taking those caveats into account.

    Megatron's robot mode
looks even better than his gun mode, looking for the most part like he
leapt out of the G1 cartoon. He's got a nice evil, nasty grin plastered
on his face, and the rest of his robot mold detailing is accurate to the
'toon, as well. His proportions are pretty solid, with the exception of
the arms-- although they're roughly the right length, there's not even
a discernable elbow area molded into them from most angles, making them
look a bit overly thick and chubby. The "fusion cannon" made up of the
pistol nozzle also looks a little odd where it connects to Megatron's right
arm due to the transformation, but at this size, I'm willing to let it
slide for the most part. His articulation is great for a Legends toy--
he can move at the shoulders, hips, and knees, and all of those are on
ball joints. Plus, his feet are molded to be splayed at a slight angle,
giving him added stability. Given that Megatron is in the "Reveal the Shield"
subline, he has an allegiance rub symbol sticker on his chest-- rub it,
and it'll reveal that he's (surprise!) a Decepticon.

    Autobot Alliance "G1"
Megatron is a great update of the original toy, giving you a pretty darned
cartoon-accurate version of the character in a tiny size, with great proportions
in both modes. He's almost worth getting simply because we're getting a
pretty realistically-colored version of his G1 form again, but even ignoring
that, it's a well-engineered toy in both modes given the size, with good
proportions and only a few minor oddities. He definitely gets a solid recommendation
from me.
