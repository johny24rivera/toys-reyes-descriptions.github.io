    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Blazemaster.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     from the first movie
line, although this is definitely a smaller helicopter model than the first--
so did he lose like over half his body mass or something and this is how
they managed to repair him? Well, anyways, the search-and-rescue color
scheme of orange and white works quite well on a helicopter, as they both
contrast very well, and the shade of orange on Evac isn't obnoxious or
anything like that. It looks pretty good, having orange on the ends with
white in the middle of the vehicle mode, and all the "rescue markings"
like the markings around his Autobot symbol and the "C-72" logo amidst
the black strikes look quite good and add more variety to his scheme. This
version of Evac has considerably less black than the previous version,
so his color scheme lacks a particularly dark color scheme. But on smaller
toy like this, that doesn't particularly bother me, particular since the
accent colors work so well-- the sky blue used mostly for the windows goes
GREAT with both the orange and white, and the yellow highlights are appropriate
for a rescue 'copter. The bits of silver are a nice gunmetal metallic shade,
and help to give his robot bits more of a metal-y appearance. That is one
downside about Evac's color scheme, though-- the transparent plastic used
for the cockpit, which was rather dark on Blazemaster, is light enough
on this toy where you can easily see the robot head behind the windows
in vehicle mode. Eeennnh.

     No mold changes have
been made to RotF Evac-- which makes it all the more interesting that his
head still manages to look so much like Movie 1's Evac through the clever
useage of paint apps.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     RotF Evac is a great
repaint, with some great and fitting colors for a rescue helicopter. It's
also nice to see updates to movie characters that weren't actually in the
movies. However, as far as molds go, this is a definite downgrade from
his previous version, and I'm not just talking about the size of the helicopter--
this is one of the weakest mainline molds from Revenge of the Fallen. As
such, unless you have a particular thing for Coast Guard-esque color schemes,
I'd pass this one over.

       Since coming to Earth, Evac has made
it his business to clean up the messes left behind by the relentless Autobot
pursuit of Decepticons around the world. Usually, that means search and
rescue, but occasionally it also means taking out a Decepticon that manages
to escape the Autobot dragnet. Dirge has managed to evade the Autobots
too often, so now it's time for Evac to step in.
