    Rail Racer is an excellent
gestalt. He's actually one of the few Transformers gestalts that can pass
as being just one solid toy at a first glance.

     Railspike's

    color schemes
go together excellently, and
    <a href="rapidrun.html">
     Rapid Run's
    </a>
    is
a nice complement to them. Rail Racer not only has a great color scheme,
but he's well-proportioned and has a great design, as well. His legs are
slightly asymmetrical, as it is with Midnight Express, but it's no big
deal. His arms are also nice and bulky, and his jet pack on his back is
nice and large. A little too large, perhaps, but it doesn't subtract from
the look that much (even though Rapid Run's robot arms are pretty visible
on it from the back side). He has a nice samurai "dress" at his waist,
made out of Midnight Express' shoulder plates, and it definitely adds a
bit of character. Rail Racer's "combination gun", made out of Midnight
and Railspike's guns, is also pretty cool. It's pretty hard to get Rapid
Run's gun to fit right in Rail Racer's hand, however, without it accidentally
firing its missle. You could always make it double as a shield, but still...
The only major problem I have with Rail Racer is that there is a rather
large and blatant hole in the upper part of his train front-chest, which
makes it a bit too obvious that Rail Racer's excellently done (with a transparent
"cap"!) robot head fits in there in Railspike's train mode. Rail Racer
is pretty articulated in this mode, especially for a gestalt. However,
his arms are rather oddly jointed, and his shoulder ball joints pop off
a bit more easily than I'd like because of this and because of his hollow
shoulder panels. Unlike nearly every other Transformer gestalt, Rail Racer
fits together very well in this mode, and doesn't fall apart easily- the
clips that hold the three trains together at the torso are nice and tight.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overall, Rail Racer
is my favorite Transformer gestalt ever. He's very nicely designed, has
few flaws, and stays together very well. He's a bit pricey, however, which
may prevent some people from collecting all the Trainbots to get him.
