    *2018 UPDATE/BUYER BEWARE: After several
years, the brown plastic on Transmetal Megatron has shown reports of mild-to-moderate
Gold Plastic Syndrome (crumbling). Be aware of this when purchasing this
toy.*

     Beast mode is a metallized
tyrannosaurus rex. His face looks very fierce and nicely sculpted. The
detailing over the rest of his body is great too, with tubes and wires
molded all over. No robot extras visible except for his lower neck, which
shows his robot hands. His tail is very flexible, unlike the original

     Vehicle mode is a tyrannosaurus
rex with turbines on his hips and roller skates for feet. This a somewhat
nice mode, finally giving Megatron flight. The purple part of the turbines
is able to turn, but the turbine as a whole cant turn at all. His skates
dont roll, however, which is a big setback.

     Robot mode has no extras
on the bottom, but on the top this mode has a bit of shoulder armor.
Although this does complement the mode some, it does get in the way some.
His feet are the same as his beast mode's, and look nice with the purple
claws. His tail becomes a pulsar gun/claw, with a little hook so he can
hold it. He has a part of a tyrannousaurus head on his chest, and this
looks very nice.

     The best Megatron, in
my opinion. Highly recommended.

       A quantum surge rips across the Beast
Wars world altering Megatron, evil genius and leader of the Predacons,
into a metal-armored T-Rex. New turbine powered V.T.O.L. (Vertical Take-off
and Landing) engines extend from his body, providing blazing atmospheric
flight and the ability to drop in on unexpecting Maximals with his whiplash
cutlass! Fused reptilian musculature enhances his power in an organic robot
mode. The result: creation of a supreme tyrant!
