    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Target Exclusive Robovision
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Robovision

Prime is an obvious homage to Optimus Prime's original
     <a href="g1prime.html">
      G1
color layout
     </a>
     , though it's not as slavish to the original as some other
G1 homages. For one thing, there's the added prerequisite Allspark Power
electric blue on some parts of the robot mode (namely, the shoulders, chest,
and upper legs), and it works surprisingly well on an already fairly light-colored
scheme. I particularly like the Allspark patterns on Prime's shoulders.
There's also considerably more red on First Strike Optimus Prime than was
on the original toy, and it's of a noticeably lighter shade. Personally,
I think this is a change for the worse, though it certainly doesn't look
outright BAD-- the light red really would've worked better as a darker
shade, and there should have been more dark blue, particularly on the upper
body/arms, to help counteract all the light red. The milky gunmetal gray
isn't metallic silver like on Robovision Prime, but it's the next best
thing, and looks semi-metallic and goes great with the red and blue. Using
a few yellow accents was a nice touch, as well. Still, particularly in
vehicle mode, First Strike Prime looks rather plain, having all those cool
flames replaced with just a plain silver stripe going across his vehicle
mode. His front half looks particularly bare in terms of paint apps.

     First Strike Optimus
Prime is a decent repaint, and a nice homage to the G1 version-- however,
unless you absolutely can't stand the flames on Movie Prime, I'd pick up
the

      original release
     </a>
     of this mold, or better
yet, the Robovision version, as I think the flames on the truck mode make
it look infinitely more interesting.

       When the AllSpark was destroyed, the
war against the Decepticons ended in one stroke. Optimus Prime was bathed
in the power of the shattered AllSpark. The gaps in his armor gleam with
ancient energy, his eyes and voice pulse with power. He has become a living
receptacle of the creative power of the AllSpark, capable of healing 
or destroying  with the merest thought. Despite this, he remains dedicated
to peace. As a symbol of this dedication, he has altered his exterior decorations
to match the ones he bore as a young leader, before the beginning of the
war.
