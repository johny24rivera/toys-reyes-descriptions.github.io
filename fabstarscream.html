    Starscream's F-22 Raptor
mode is slightly chibi-fied, given that he's a Fast Action Battler aimed
at a younger audience than the "normal" movie toys, but it's not TOO chibi-fied--
his cockpit is a bit stubby and his jet mode is a tad wider proportionally
than it should be, but that's it. The color scheme, consisting almost entirely
of pale light tan in this mode, is pretty darn dull, even if it is realistic.
Putting a few paint apps on the center of his jet mode to help break up
the colors would have been appreciated, even though the white lines on
the edges of his nosecone and wings help out some. (It's not nearly as
bad in robot mode, at least.) His mold detailing is very good, though,
with little mechanical plating and aerodynamic patterns molded all over
his jet mode. However, although Battle Blade Starscream has less undercarriage
junk than his
    <a href="movstarscream.html">
     mainline Voyager class version
    </a>
    ,
he still has some pretty darn obvious robot extras in this mode that pretty
much ruin its look. For one, the robot legs just hang off the bottom rear
end of this vehicle mode, and they're folded up in such a manner where
the feet stick out REALLY obviously from behind the rear wings. I mean,
Starscream's feet stick out from the bottom of the plane so much that you
HAVE to have his landing gear under the nosecone extended or he leans forward
big time in this mode. Plus, Starscream's hands are pretty obvious sticking
out from the front of the jet mode. There's missiles molded on the outside
(in this mode) of the hands to try to help them "blend in", but honestly
it's a pretty pathetic attempt at it.

    I don't have many good
things to say about Starscream's extremely awkward robot mode, so let's
get the few good things out of the way first. His legs are decently proportioned,
and the black wash used on many of his robot parts really brings out all
the excellent molded-in detail very well. His head sculpt is also very
well-done and has quite a few paint apps. His action gimmick is a flip-out
"Battle blade" on his right arm, which can be activated by releasing a
lever on the shoulder. It's not uber-cool or anything, but it's nice to
see Starscream with a melee weapon and actual HANDS instead of them both
being missile cannons like on the mainline Voyager toy. Alright, now on
to the extreme awkwardness of this mode. The hands are way too skinny,
and due to the way the toy in constructed, although the arms can both move
at the shoulders, the right arm can only face straight outwards or straight
downwards, with no real "in between" positioning. (Starscream's other points
of articulation are at the neck, hips, and knees-- he's not all that poseable.)
Having missiles in Starscream's palms also looks rather odd. His head is
also looking downwards into his chest, and can only look from side-to-side
so it's not like this can be compensated for by tilting his head up or
anything. The biggest beef I have with this mode by far, however, is the
fact that the halves of the main body of his vehicle mode just hang off
the sides of his body, which is already too wide proportionally. It just
looks really odd, having these highly detailed pieces of plastic hanging
off his body that shouldn't even be there in the first place and don't
even look like anything. I've seen Transformers with a lot of kibble before,
but not kibble with a ton of paint-washed detail that screams "look at
me!" too.

is the worst of all the Fast Action Battlers. Both of his modes have some
pretty crippling downsides-- in vehicle mode it's his incredibly obvious
robot mode extras, and in robot mode it's his very awkward proportions
and vehicle kibble. Recommended only for completists or hardcore Starscream
fans.

      Starscream prefers to attack from the
sky, where none of the Autobots can reach him, but the skies of Earth are
awfully crowded with humans and ridiculous machines. Thats all right though;
there are some fights where a missile just isnt personal enough. Thats
why he had the retractable battle blades installed. He loves to see the
look of fear in Autobot eyes when he snaps out his razor-sharp energy blades.
