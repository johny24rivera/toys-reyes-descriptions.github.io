    Beast mode is a technorganic
gorilla. This mode is fairly show-accurate, but there's one major thing
that bugs me about this mode (as well as the robot mode); the yellow and
amber part of the color scheme. It clashes with the rest, and it doesn't
look right on a gorilla at all- not to mention it's not show-accurate.
If the color scheme were only changed to a more show-accurate scheme, than
this toy would almost be a dead-on likeness of the show version. Other
than this major drawback, this mode's pretty cool. The detailing is amazing-
there's fur and mechanical detailing everywhere. I also LOVE the "brass
knuckles". A very nice touch. The gorilla face looks a bit odd, however.
For some odd reason, Hasbro decided to smother dull orange paint on his
upper lip, which looks rather silly, since I don't think any gorilla has
any color like that on its lip. It makes poor Optimus look like he's been
sniffing paint. The mechanical detailing on the sides of Optimus' gorilla
head is nice, but for some reason, they look like elf ears. Kinda funny
how one thing can be mistaken for another, huh? Optimus' action gimmick
in this mode is that, if you push down on the blue button on the top of
his head, his lip curls up in a "growl". It's surprisingly realistic, although
the eyes, which are completely white, negate the fear effect some. Optimus'
"hunch" in this mode is entriely too large when looked at from a side view,
and it curves down to meet his torso way too steeply. Another thing about
this mode is that the posability is somewhat limited- the legs can only
move at the hips, the arm with the "blast punch" gimmick" (discussed later)
can only move at the shoulder, and the arm without the blast punch gimmick
can only move at the shoulder and ever-so-slightly at the elbow, due to
Optimus' very large arms. Still, this mode's pretty decent, overall.

    Although Blast Punch
Optimus' transformation may look like just a "stand me up and flip my head"
transformation, it's actually a bit more complicated than that. You switch
the toes and fingers to make them look more "robotic", and you also lengthen
his legs a bit. The only pain about the transformation, however, is that
you have to fire out the missile in Primal's left arm so you can turn the
hand around for transformation. It's rather a pain to have to take the
thing out every time.

    Anyway, Primal's robot
mode is almost 100% show-accurate, minus the colors, of course. There's
entirely too much transparent plastic in this mode- the upper arms, part
of the lower arms, and the main upper body of Optimus Primal are all transparent.
I HATE having transparent plastic used for main body parts! It makes no
sense! Anyway, ranting aside, this mode's pretty darn neat, although the
way they colored Optimus' robot face, it makes him look like some kind
of Mexican wrestler. A more show-accurate coloration there would have been
appreciated. Primal has small "jet packs" that come out of his back, but
they're a bit TOO small, barely stick out at all. Now, onto the reason
for the name of this toy; the Blast Punch gimmick. Basically, by cranking
Primal's left shoulder pad up and down about 20 times or so (until you
hear it "click" and start resisting) and then pressing his neat-looking
two-layered spark crystal embedded in his upper left arm, it will activate
his "Blast Punch" gimmick. It's rather cool- once you get past the 10 seconds
or so it takes for his lower left arm to swivel around by itself every
so sloooowly until it reaches a trigger. Once it finally reaches the trigger,
Primal's fist punches out about half an inch, and he fires a missile from
it. Very neat, although I wish I didn't have to wait so long to activate
the gimmick.

    Although Blast Punch
Optimus Primal's a pretty neat transformer, many people have complained
that his modes look too similar, and that is one major downfall- the transformation
really doesn't do much for as long as you spend on it. Still, Optimus is
a great-looking toy with a neat gimmick (which works most of the time,
although some people have complained of theirs not working), and I'd recommended
it to a Beast Machines fan.

      Intelligence, experience, passion and
skill are all crucial parts of what makes Optimus Primal the proven leader
of the Maximal cause. His metaphysical views play a large role in the methods
to defeat Megatron and the Vehicons. A master at the art of change and
ability to actualize multiple mode potential in others. Easily the strongest
of the Maximals. Can punch through most Vehicon alloys with his boastful
fist. Capable of short flights while in Robot Mode, and Beast Mode provides
him with formidable speed and strength on the ground. Will stop at nothing
to save the techno-organic world of Cybertron and defeat Megatron.

      (NOTE: Because Blast Punch Optimus Primal was one of the last toys of
the Battle for the Spark line to be released, he is somewhat rare. If you
find one at the store, whether you like the toy or not, I'd recommend you
pick it. There's bound to be someone on the internet who will want it.)
