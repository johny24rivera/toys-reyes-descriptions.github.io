    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Blurr. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Animated Blurr

     Cheetor is a rather inventive
remold of the Animated Blurr toy, both in terms of taking an appropriate
alt mode for a former- (or, in this universe's case, never-) cheetah 'bot,
and in terms of being a slight nod to the never-released Transtech Cheetor
toy, which had a similar alt mode and hollow wheel-feet. As those of you
who have been reading my reviews for a while know, I'm not particularly
fond of the color yellow in large amounts-- but of course, on Cheetor here,
it's the only really acceptable color. The black windows, wheels, and spots
contrast quite well with the yellow, and the transparent green headlights
and chainsaw weapon help to both vary the colors up and provide a slight
nod to his various Beast Machines toys. The bits of red and silver on the
wheels look particularly good-- almost TRON-like, really. In robot mode
the bits of orange help add yet another highlighting color to his form,
and again call back to his Beast Machines color scheme in terms of its
general placement. That said, I'm not fond of Cheetor's spots being so...
organic-looking. It just goes a BIT too far beyond my ability to suspend
my disbelief, given he's never been a beast in this continuity. The original
call was for him to have more hexagonal spots, which I think would've worked
much better, but it didn't look the people who were in charge of the deco
for this toy agreed.

     Cheetor has a new headsculpt,
but unfortunately, it's rather botched. All of the details are there that
both pay homage to his various forms-- the large circle behind his jaw
hearkens back to his Beast Machines form, the slight goatee to his later
Beast Wars forms, and his three-pronged headcrest to all of his Beast Wars
forms-- but they're been laid out in such a manner that it looks like Cheetor's
sculpt has been "smeared back" from the front, with his eyes being too
far back on each side. His middle headcrest also looks a little "limp",
particularly in vehicle mode where it's supposed to be an antennae. The
whole sculpt just generally looks ugly, which is a real shame given how
nice his concept art looks.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Animated Cheetor is
a pretty inspired remold, but the botched headsculpt-- combined with the
prevalance of yellow, a color I'm not fond of (regardless of how well it
fits the character)-- have me recommending Blurr over this more expensive
exclusive version, unless you're a huge Cheetor fan.

       Cheetor loves the thrill of the chase.
When his turbo sensors lock on to the tail lights of a fleeing Decepticon,
he pushes his accelerator to the floor. He can get a little too focused
on his games of cat-and-mouse. When his optics lock in on the perp, his
surroundings fade into a blur as he races in pursuit. Neither street signs,
traffic flow, nor even that unfortunate bot caught crossing his path matter
to him during his dash.
