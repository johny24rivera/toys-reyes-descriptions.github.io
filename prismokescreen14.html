    Just like the other 2014
Beast Hunters deluxes, Smokescreen is an upsized version of his
    <a href="pricysmokescreen.html">
     earlier
Legion-class mold
    </a>
    , with a few minor changes made to ensure better stability
at a larger size. Thus, even though this is technically a new mold, for
a full review on the general design itself, see the linked review for that
earlier toy. Smokescreen takes the deluxe up-scale reasonably well in vehicle
mode, though even for a sleek sportscar he appears a bit under-detailed
in this mode in terms of the mold. At least it's a solid looking alt mode,
though, and he does have three ports for 5mm weapons-- one on each side
in front of the rear tire, and on the top of his hood. In robot mode is
where the over-simplification becomes a bit of an eyesore, particularly
in regards to how stiff he looks. The ball joints at the shoulders and
hips have been reworked; each of those two joints is now a two-part friction
joint which allows for more-or-less the same range of movement. That said,
given the design there's no reason he couldn't have had elbows and/or knees
added as well, which is a bummer. The gap in between his feet and heels
was already not a positive thing on his Legion class toy, and here it's
positively an eyesore. However, the simplified chest design does actually
look better overall at this size than on his
    <a href="prismokescreen.html">
     original
deluxe Beast Hunters toy
    </a>
    , which I suppose I can chalk up to the latter
having a completely fake, overly flat chest. Another few unexpected positives
are that Smokescreen's rather intricate mold detailng on his legs and arms
still holds up pretty well, though his headsculpt could stand to be a bit
more defined. Due to the larger size, the shoulders actually peg into their
grooves better on this toy compared to the Legion class mold as well, which
is a significant plus. For weapons Smokescreen comes with two rather rad
axe weapons-- with their pseudo-medieval look, they fit right with the
Beast Hunters line, and in car mode can he mounted like gun-weapons, which
is a nice little touch.

    Smokescreen sticks with
his same general colors as on the original deluxe, thankfully not using
the inaccurate gray of his original Legion class toy. The blue used looks
better than on the original deluxe, being a bit darker and contrasting
with the pure white conisderably better. The tan weapons also go well with
the white, and the black wheels and paint on the windows, waist, and knees
also serve as excellent contrast colors. The checkered "38" pattern on
the doors is intact and looks great, and the orangish yellow color for
the headlights pops as well. His robot legs and arms could still use a
little more paint, but overall the color scheme is one of the few areas
where I'd say this toy surpasses the original deluxe Smokescreen, in my
opinion.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Smokescreen's Legion
class toy makes a better transition to deluxe size than you think it would,
with a nice-looking main body, few overly cumbersome extras in his robot
mode (feet bits being the only major ones), and a color scheme that actually
is more eye-catching than on his original Beast Hunters deluxe version.
That said, his mold detailing is too simplistic for deluxe class-- particularly
in vehicle mode-- and he suffers from the same very limited poseability
that the other 2014 upsized deluxes have. Recommended for a young 'un who
wants a larger Smokescreen toy or if you absolutely do not want a Smokescreen
with any Beast Hunters armor; otherwise, get the original deluxe version
of this design instead. (This is especially the case since this version
was not released in the U.S., and is thus rarer and generally more expensive
to acquire.)
