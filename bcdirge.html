    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars Buzzclaw. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars Buzzclaw

     Dirge is the second use
of the Beast Wars Buzzclaw mold in the "Descent into Evil" core 7-figure
convention set, He's one of the two Insecticons that Deathsaurus uses to
make clones of, so of course he needs to share some classic "Insecticon"
color characteristics with his teammate Buzzclaw, while still retaining
his own unique look. The toy designers did this by simply switching Buzzclaw's
purple and yellow around. The transparent yellow used on Dirge looks pretty
nice, though not quite as nice as the transparent purple on Buzzclaw. The
glossy metallic purple paint used, however, looks fantastic, though I question
the use of it on the head, as it doesn't provide enough contrast against
the transparent yellow on paint apps as small as the ones on Dirge's face.
The other plastic parts and paint apps on Dirge are identical to his partner
Buzzclaw. The black contrasts quite well with the yellow, red, and purple
and gives Dirge a bit more of a "Decepticonish" scheme, and the red also
looks very good on the eyes and bug "tail", but ESPECIALLY the insect wings.
Gotta love all the wonderful black "wing vein" and red detailing on the
wings, it's the most eye-catching part of the toy. Dirge also has a little
Decepticon insignia on the underside of his tail, in case you had any doubts
about his allegiance after seeing the way he looks.

     No mold changes have
been made to Dirge from his predecessor; however, like on the other Botcon
Buzzclaw repaints, the mandibles have been assembled the wrong way; to
fix this, you need to unscrew the bolt connecting the insect head to the
neck, crack open the halves (don't put too much force into it), switch
the mandibles around so they're facing the other direction, and then reassemble
the thing again. It's rather difficult, though, and you can break some
of the pegs holding together the two head halves if you're not careful,
so I only recommend doing this is you're experienced with taking apart
and reassembling toys.

     Dirge is a great repaint
of the Buzzclaw mold, though I wish perhaps a few more color swappings
had been used to differentiate him from Botcon Buzzclaw. I like the yellow
used for his main body, but not quite as much as the purple used for Botcon
Buzzclaw, so Buzzclaw wins out a little in the looks department between
the two in the "Descent into Evil" set.

       Dirge is one of the few remaining members
of the ancient Insecticon clan, a group of powerful Transformer warriors
dating back to the beginnings of the Great Wars. Once a prominent commander
in the clan, he has witnessed their number shrink over the ages. He views
himself as the loyal lieutenant which history will remember as standing
by a great Emperor. Who that Emperor is does not matter to him, as long
as the Decepticon Empire rises again. He has pledged his loyalty to Deathsaurus,
until someone more powerful (and thus more worthy) comes along to replace
him.

       Abilities: Dirge is a brilliant tactician,
having once led legions of troops into combat. His wings are able to generate
an aural disruption field that activates the pain receptors of anyone unfortunate
enough to be caught in it. In beast mode, his claws secrete an acid that
aids them in tearing through enemy armor. In robot mode, he can fire bursts
of high voltage electricity from his hands to incapacitate enemies.
