    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Dinobot Transmetal 2. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Dinobot Transmetal 2

     At first glance, this
repaint seems to be no different than its predecessor. A closer inspection,
however, proves this assumption to be in error. This repaint gives Dinobot
Transmetal 2 a slightly brighter, and surprisingly more show-accurate,
color scheme. The original's bone-white is replaced with a purer white,
and the dark blue is replaced with a slightly brighter and purer blue as
well. This makes this toy slightly more pleasing to the eye than its original,
and a bit less bland. The transmetal coloration remains the same, however,
as does the detailing on the transmetal plates. Although no apparent mold
changes have been made to this repaint, the joints seem a bit tighter on
this toy (but not too tight), and this is good- the original toy had a
problem of degrading joints. These joint problems could just be my toys,
however. Other than that, this toy retains all the features and flaws of
its predecessor, mold-wise.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Overall, because his
color scheme is a bit more pleasing, I recommend this repaint over the
original, even though it's still essentially the same.
