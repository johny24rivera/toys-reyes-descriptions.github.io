     Like the other toys in
this "Knight" 3-pack, Alpha Trizer is an update/homage to a previous BotCon
exclusive-- however, unlike Apelinq and Flareup, his original concept was
never produced. Originally 3H-- the folks who ran BotCon before FunPub--
had a concept for redecoing
     <a href="bmsnarl.html">
      Beast Machines Snarl
     </a>
     into Alpha Trion, but it never came to fruition for various reasons. Since
     <a href="bcalphatrion.html">
      Alpha
Trion
     </a>
     has already had a toy made by FunPub, enter Alpha Trizer-- kinda
like Alpha Trion, but different. Alpha Trizer certainly has Trion's colors--
a medium purple and white are his two main colors, and they go together
extremely well, contrasting with each other quite nicely. The purple is
a particularly eye-catching shade. There's also a fair amount of dull red
on Alpha Trizer-- again homaging Alpha Trion, with most of the red appearing
on bits of the robot legs, robot shoulders/lion claws, and a few spots
on the lion and robot head. There's also some nice silver on appropriate
parts like the rear claws and stripe down the sides of the mane, as well
as on his face and upper robot legs. In places where silver paint wasn't
used for whatever reason, a light gray plastic was used instead for a few
parts like the front claws and some minor connector pieces. It's a blah
gray, but at least it's not a plastic color that's used much. Last but
not least, there's a bit of periwinkle used for the eyes in both modes--
a really nice shade that contrasts against the white and purple very nicely,
and is also in keeping with the Cybertronian Knight emblem-- complete with
wings-- on the left side of Alpha Trizer's "cape". The paint apps are also
varied up considerably, with few parts on Alpha Trizer looking too "one-tone"--
the sole exception to this being the rear body of the lion mode, where
there's a bit too much unpainted purple. The white sword could also have
used some silver paint, as well. I do love the paint details that hearken
back to Beast Machines Snarl's details, like the ovals on the upper legs
and the accentuated fur on the lower arms. (And let's not forget they're
both lion-formers with beards!)

     No mold changes have
been made to Alpha Trizer, though like most other BotCon exclusives, the
electronics have been gutted from his weapon (not that the light would
have made any sense on this toy anyways, with there being no transparent
plastic).

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Alpha Trizer is a really
nice treat for long-time BotCon fans, finally bringing a great idea to
fruition, yet not just slapping the "Alpha Trion" name on him now that
Alpha Trion has an actual existing toy. It's a good color scheme on a decent
mold, though I wish FunPub had done a bit more to differentiate the face
from Thundertron's-- it's a bit weird to see the face of the Star Seeker
captain in the
     <i>
      Prime
     </i>
     series and the leader of the Knights here have
basically the same face. Recommended, as long as you're part of the somewhat
niche "BotCon-only character fan" audience it's targeting compared to some
other exclusives.

       As the wise and mysterious spiritual
leader of the Autobots and Maximals, Alpha Trizer has experienced many
pivotal moments in Cybertronian history. Although he shares the wisdom
that he has acquired through these experiences, he doesn't seem to share
many personal details. No one seems to know his true age or origins, but
it's obvious that he has seen more than your average 'bot. A source of
inspiration and insight, Alpha Trizer serves as the conduit to the Oracle/Vector
Sigma and a connection to the very heart of Cybertron. This connection
has obviously made him the 'bot he is today, but what came before?

       Alpha Trizer puts his faith in the Oracle
and the Allspark, claiming that he has seen its wisdom firsthand. If there
is one spark in particular that he would like this wisdom to reach, it
would be Ginrai. He sees a lot of the leaders of the past (and of himself)
in the unyielding Knight Commander and hopes to help bring a sense of balance
to tame the lion within him. He knows that Ginrai sees his Zen-like approach
as passive and naive, claiming he has no time for the old bot's riddles
or waiting for the day when "all will be revealed". As the saying goes,
can a cheetah change its spots? Alpha Trizer believes with all his spark
that it can.
