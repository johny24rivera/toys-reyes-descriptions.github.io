    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Cyber Slammer '08 Bumblebee
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Cyber Slammer
'08 Bumblebee toy

     Based on the
     <a href="movcliffjumper.html">
      mainline
deluxe repaint
     </a>
     of the same name, Cyber Slammer Cliffjumper follows
the same general color scheme, right down to the black-edged silver stripes
on the front of the car mode and the "charcoal" off-black used for the
black paint instead of the "purer" black paint that is used on either of
the Cyber Slammer Bumblebees. The metallic blue paint used for Cliffjumper's
windows is noticeably darker than that used for Cyber Slammer '08 Bumblebee,
which works quite well against Cliffjumper's pretty light shade of red.
(In fact, Cliffjumper's red really could stand to be a few shades darker
on this toy, all things considered, since it's so much more prevalent here
than on the mainline toy.) There are a few noticeable discrepancies in
the color layout between the mainline release of Cliffjumper and this Cyber
Slammer version, however. For one, his lower arms are silver on the Cyber
Slammer toy (which, in my opinion, looks better), as opposed to having
charcoal black arms like the mainline release. Cliffjumper's stomach is
also red with a bit of silver, as opposed to charcoal gray with blue (and
in this case, I think the mainline release wins). Cliffjumper's dark colors
really could've been a bit more prevalent, overall-- especially on his
robot parts and on his back end, but he still looks rather cool regardless.
(Oh, and the paint apps on his face still make him look rather ugly, "cute"
Cyber Slammer or not, in my opinion.)

     No mold changes have

     I think Cyber Slammer
Cliffjumper looks better than Cyber Slammer '08 Bumblebee-- primarily because
I'm not a big fan of the color yellow-- but Cliffjumper really could've
used more of that charcoal gray to help offset all the light red. Recommended
slightly over Cyber Slammer '08 Bumblebee, but I don't think Cyber Slammer
Cliffjumper's as much an improvement color-wise as the mainline release
is over the mainline '08 Bumblebee toy.
