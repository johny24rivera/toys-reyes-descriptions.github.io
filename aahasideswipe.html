    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Human
Alliance Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original RotF Human Alliance Sideswipe toy

     Shadow Blade Sideswipe
is the first Human Alliance mold to be repainted, which is honestly a bit
unfortunate as I find it the worst mold in the subline to be released thus
far. However, that aside, his color scheme is pretty attractive, and certainly
worthy of the "Shadow Blade" name. Yes, he's mostly black, but it's the
secondary colors and paint apps that really make the figure, along with
the transparent purple bits, which are a really attractive shade. The silver
stripes along the sides and top of the car mode look really slick, and
he doesn't actually have any real "gray" plastic-- it's all been painted
silver, which really makes those parts look stunning in robot mode. The
dark brown and dull tan serve as nice fairly neutral plastic colors in
robot mode, though I would've made the brown perhaps a tad lighter to help
with the contrast a bit better. The couple of blue paint apps in robot
mode also really contrast well with the silver and make the mode pop even
more.

     Shadow Blade Sideswipe
has no mold changes made to this version, though the miniature Mikaela
Banes figure has a different head on this version (with her hair pulled
back into a ponytail). (However, otherwise the Mikaela Banes minifig is
merely repainted from her

Alliance appearance.)

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Shadow Blade Sideswipe
is a seriously sweet repaint, with the way the silver, purple, and black
play off each other being particularly eye-catching. Short of paint apps
this toy's not. Unfortunately, well... it's the Human Alliance Sideswipe
mold, so the robot mode is very limited in its poseability and has a ton
of kibble. Recommended over this figure's other deco jobs, but that doesn't
change it being a mediocre mold at best.

       Sideswipe prides himself on being a
good driver, but he's never met anyone with the instinctive feel for the
road that Mikaela Banes has. Her driving is so smooth and perfect that
he is left free to concentrate entirely on his blades and the target ahead.
