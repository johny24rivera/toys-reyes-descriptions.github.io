    Shockwave's alternate
mode is, well... it's a flying gun just like his G1 form, appropriately
enough, but it gets rid of all the silliness of being a
    <i>
     literal
    </i>
    giant flying gun. It has wings and there's no trigger or handhold to speak
of, but there is a big blaster that takes up the front half of the figure,
along with some jet boosters on the back end. So, yeah... flying gun. And
unlike many Cybertronian modes, this alt mode doesn't look like a mere
"robot in a weird pose", i.e. a bit of excuse for a lazy alt mode. No,
this looks like something that could legitimately exist-- particularly
if you take the rather eye-catching shade of transparent purplish pink
sticking up behind the "barrel" part of this mode as the window of a cockpit.
The wings could stand to be a bit larger, but otherwise the proportions
on Shockwave here are quite pleasing, even if there's nothing like it in
the real world to compare it to. There are a few minor robot extras visible,
though, such as the robot feet on the front end and a bit of the arms on
the back end. There's also some slight gaps in the barrel of the flying
cannon if you look at them from the right (wrong?) angles, but I'm being
rather nitpicky on that last one. Shockwave's signature color scheme of
deep purple, black, and silver works very well here, with the silver serving
as the more prevalent lighter accent color against the darker purple and
black. The purplish pink plastic/paint used on the "cockpit" and the front
barrel of the gun complements and contrasts against the purple and black
quite brilliantly, as well. That said, although the really major stuff--
like the front of the barrel-- is painted, along with a few extra bits
like the middle of the barrel and the wing tips, in general Shockwave could've
used a few more paint apps in this mode (particularly of the purplish-pink
variety).

    As good as Shockwave's
vehicle mode is, his robot mode design is even better-- and the transformation
isn't too obvious either, which impresses me all the more. This mode looks
SPOT-ON compared to his video game model, with one exception-- his legs
are a bit two-dimensional if looked at from a front angle. Other than that,
it's all good proportionally, and I love love LOVE how those forward-swept
wings frame his shoulders in this mode. It definitely helps to add to his
"evil presence", if you will. His already nice mold detailing in vehicle
mode gets even more impressive here, with pieces like his chest and head
intricately detailed-- his head sculpt is another thing that is absolutely
spot-on with this toy (though I wish his eye was yellow), and it even has
little "wires" molded into the neck piece underneath! There's no vehicle
mode extras whatsoever, and his articulation is quite good as well-- he
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
inwards at the wrists, and at the hips and knees (at two points). Most
of the places that only have one point of articulation are on ball joints,
too. His feet are a bit small, and his head can't look up, so that SLIGHTLY
limits the number of poses you can get him into, but neither of those are
huge deals. Because of his transformation, however, you can definitely
tell how small he is compared to deluxes from the previous few years, but
unfortunately this the norm going forward due to increased manufacturing
costs. If you have Shockwave's fists flipped out, the inside of his lower
arms is hollow, but this is a minor issue. It doesn't become an issue at
all if you fold that fist back in and plug his gun onto either of his lower
arms, creating his signature cannon-arm (albeit this version doesn't have
any kid of hose connecting it to his backpack, but that's often annoying
anyways). The three-pronged shape of his cannon barrel makes the cannon
look larger and more menacing, and I love it. If you don't want it connected
to either of his hands, however, you can store it on his back in this mode
as well.

    Fall of Cybertron Shockwave
is a remarkable feat of engineering, not only giving him a pretty good-looking
Cybertronian alt mode that keeps the best parts of his G1 alt mode while
discarding the weird parts, but has a fantastic, well-proportioned, and
well-articulated robot mode that's brimming with personality and has a
cool accessory. His transformation is also intuitive, fun, and unexpected
without being complex. Highly recommended-- this is my favorite toy from
the FoC part of the Generations line, definitely, and that's not just my
love of the character speaking there. It's also my favorite Shockwave toy
as of this writing (12/14).

      Shockwave may appear to be loyal to
Megatron, but in reality he serves only one master-- pure logic. Behind
his emotionless face rests the mind of a brilliant strategist and mathematician.
He calculates constantly, and enforces his solutions through the precise
application of the vast power of his laser cannon.
