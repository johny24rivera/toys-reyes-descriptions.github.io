     Like some of the other
BotCon 2014 exclusives, "Hunter" is an homage/update to a previous BotCon
exclusive, given that 2014 was BotCon's 20th anniversary. Hunter here is
a "pre-Shokaract
     <a href="shokaract.html">
      Shokaract
     </a>
     ", going by the
comic story and by the Botcon 2000 exclusive. As such, he's a redeco of
the 2014 "freebie" club exclusive
     <a href="bcrampage.html">
      Rampage
     </a>
     ,
and uses the same new headsculpt-- which, unfortunately, is a fairly substantial
negative. As detailed in my Rampage review, it's a head that's definitely
too small and looks very awkward in vehicle mode. Still, if we're talking
just about colors-- which, since this a redeco, is pretty much all I'll
be talking about-- Hunter is drop dead gorgeous. His main color is a rather
nice, very dark brown, but with a bit of glitter in it to make it look
semi-metallic. There's also a few other dark/dull colors, such as royal
purple on the vehicle thrusters and other minor connector pieces and a
dark metallic teal on the shoulders, lower arms, lower legs, and feet.
There's also a bit of black, mostly used for Hunter's gun but also for
some other minor pieces. These colors go together well enough, but with
all of them being so dark, it may be a little difficult to pick them out
against each other at some points. However, what really makes this color
scheme are the smattering of light colors here and there-- in particular
the bronzish orange spray on the chest and legs, as well as the dull pumpkin
orange on the shoulders and heels. This-- along with the silver on the
chest-- really makes this a superb color scheme, with the orange not only
contrasting against but also complementing the dark brown, while also serving
as a nice contrast color against the metallic teal. The head is particularly
well-painted, with a good amount of silver and bronze, as well as piercing
green eyes. There's also a bit of dark transparent green on the mouth of
his cannon, and a titch of yellow-orange on the front of the vehicle thrusters,
but both of those colors aren't used enough to really contribute anything
meaningful to the color scheme.

     No mold changes have
been made specifically to Hunter; just the same headsculpt that Rampage
has.

     Despite the odd, small
head that sticks out like a sore thumb in vehicle mode, Hunter is my favorite
version of this mold. The combination of the dark brown, teal, and bronze/orange
is spectacular, particularly when it comes to the spray paint apps, and
the purple and silver are also nice colors for them to play off of. Because
of the odd vehicle mode and headsculpt, I'd recommend the original Shokaract
over Hunter, but this makes for a nice version if you're unable to afford
the much-more-expensive Shokaract.

       Hunter's past is nothing that will ever
stand out in Cybertron's Hall of Records. Hunter spent his early years
in the lower levels of Cybertron where he fought in gladiatorial pits,
honing his skills as a tracker and fighter. There, he could let the more
feral, animalistic side of his personality come to the forefront of his
consciousness. When not in combat, he often sharpens his trade by tracking,
stalking, and preying upon lesser Cybertronians that leak Energon. Even
though he is armed with a Quantum Fusion Cannon, Hunter prefers to dismantle
them with his bare hands.

       Captain Cannonball had use for a 'bot
of Hunter's talents and approached him about joining his pirate horde.
Hunter agreed, not only because he is stricken with a bloodlust that cannot
be explained, but because he is searching for something. Hunter is defined
by his need for violence. While searching for what he desires, a path of
destruction is left in his wake. His search for what beckons him while
being part of Cannonball's crew provides opportunities that make his hunt
easier. Being mentally tugged across the galaxy by this hunger, he will
soon find what he is looking for...
