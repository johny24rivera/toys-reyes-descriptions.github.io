    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Bulkhead. For a review on the mold itself, read

     Bulkhead's "Battle Tactics"
version takes gray as its main color-- though this sounds more boring than
it actually is. The shade of gray used for most of Bulkhead's plastic this
time around is a bluish, dark shade of gray, not some kind of blah light
milky version of the color. It also serves as a nice "go-between" color
between the pure black plastic that's used for Bulkhead's tires and feet,
and the various shades of blue on his chassis. He's got the same shade
of transparent pale blue plastic that the first release of this mold had,
and the paint on his windows is of the usual silvery-blue variety. However,
what allows this color scheme to catch the eye a bit is a rather nice shade
of electric blue that, unfortunately, is mostly only visible in robot mode.
(There's a small stripe of it on each side of the vehicle mode due to how
the mold colors breakdown, but this looks rather abrupt and out-of-place,
given how it's only in those small places suddenly and nowhere else on
the mode.) The electric blue really contrasts and complements Bulkhead's
main color on the upper arms, rear tires, and part of the shoulders in
robot mode, to the point where I wish there was a bit more of this blue--
say, on his upper legs or feet as well. Still, he's also got a decent amount
of silver paint-- his bumpers, headlights, hands, upper legs, and head
are all coated in a nice shade of color, with a touch of red on his taillights
rounding out his color scheme and helping give the toy a bit more needed
color.

     No mold changes have
been made to Battle Tactics Bulkhead.

     Battle Tactics Bulkhead
is an okay redeco-- with the exception of the top of his vehicle mode,
no part of the toy is too much of one uninterrupted color, and he's got
a fair number of paint apps. I really like his electric blue plastic, but
using gray as a main color-- even a bluish gray-- just doesn't look nearly
as appropriate or eye-catching as Bulkhead's usual military green. I'd
recommend getting the original version over this color scheme.

       Bulkhead is fascinated with humans who
put themselves in harm's way to protect others. They lack built-in armor,
and yet they eagerly battle armed opponents or charge headfirst into dangerous
fires. His latest mission is to transport, observe, and assist these human
heroes.
