not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Movie Stockade toy.

     Gears is a light homage
to the G1 character of the same name. Of course, you wouldn't really know
it from the vehicle mode, which is colored completely different from his
G1 self. He's got a very nice-looking metallic silver paint (with just
a hint of purplish tint to it) covering every non-transparent piece of
plastic in this mode. It's decorated on the roof and on the sides with
a nice gear motif, which of course fits given his name. It's not overdone
to the point where it looks loud, but it's just there enough to give him
a bit more color variety. The transparent light pale purple is a decent
color for the windows, but painting the rear windows a light blue is very
noticeably different-- that was a bad color decision, there. All of his
necessary mold details-- such as his taillights, fornt bumper, and the
wheel spokes--are painted, as well. The orange and red used for his taillights
is a particularly poppin' color, too. In robot mode, Gears almost completely
changes his color scheme to be closer to his G1 scheme. A medium, rather
nice shade of blue and some rusty reddish brown are the main new colors
in this mode, and both of them go excellently with the silver car parts.
A few other colors, like light milky gray and black, serve mostly as accent
colors on some of the minor connector parts. Some dull bronze paint helps
to round out the general color scheme-- one can hardly say Gears isn't
colorful in robot mode. I think it's a rather ingenious way to give Gears
his G1 colors without having them show in vehicle mode, where they'd be
a bit "loud" for the generally realistically-colored movie line.

     RotF Gears is a fantastic,
imaginative repaint. He's got some G1 homage colors in robot mode and is
just generally very eye-catching in that mode. He's got tons of paint apps,
and his entire vehicle mode is covered in a nice sheen of silver paint
with some nice gear motifs that offer something different from "just" a
G1 homage repaint as well. Plus, it's great mold! Really not much to complain
about, here. Highly recommended, and recommended over Stockade.

       If there's a negative angle to be found
in any situation, Gears will find it. It's not that he's a miserable guy,
or even that he's unhappy on Earth. He just really likes complaining. Nothing
makes him happier than having something to gripe about. The other Autobots
actually find his complaining funny, rather than annoying, which is part
of the reason he keeps on doing it.
