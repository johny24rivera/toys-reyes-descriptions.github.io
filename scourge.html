    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 locust. This mode is very nicely done. The detailing is absolutely fantasic.
One of his eyes is a regular locust eye, but the other one is more robotic,
with several bumps and a robotic eye in the center. Lift up this robotic
eye to see his Predacon allegiance orb. This theme continues all along
the body, with one side or leg being being robotic, and the other more
organic. There are details of wires and metal everywhere, especially on
his abdomen. The over all look is nice, a very skinny and sharp look to
it. It can stand on its insect legs, an ability that very few other insect
Transformers can do. The only big problem with this mode is the wings-
there's a button that you can push to make the wings flap up and down,
and would be a nice effect if the button wasn't right in the path of the
wings. Thus, they usually hit your hand then you press the button. One
of the wings can fire a missle, but the other wing can't, which is odd.

    Robot mode is not as
good as the beast mode, but is still okay. It is very odd-looking, to say
the least. His huge, backwards-bending legs make it had for him to stand
up in this mode, and you can't really visualize him walking like anything
more than a chicken. His main body is skinny, and small for a deluxe. One
of his hands if nicely crafted and is no problem, but the other has almost
all the extras on it, including four of the insect legs and the insect
head! This makes this arm very hard to move with out one of these parts
getting in the way. His two halves of his insect abdomen and his wings
are attached to his back, but this doesn't get in the way often. The missles
can be taken out and be put into his right hand to be used as swords.

    A very nicely crafted
Transformer in beast mode, but odd-looking in robot mode, with a lot of
extras.

      Scourge is possibly the most despicable
of the already loathsome Predacons. Delights in taking depravity to all-time-low
levels. Obsessed with germ-warfare and lethal chemical development. Despised
by peers for his inclination to test deadly viral and bacterial concoctions
on fellow Predacons. Skilled in combat. Scourge wields proton cluster cannons
with chemical warhead capabilites. Has electrostatic disruptors inside
antennae; capable of leaping distances exceeding two miles with use of
wings.
