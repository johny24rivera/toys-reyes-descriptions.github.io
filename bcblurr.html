    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Armada Blurr. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Armada Blurr

     Evil Blurr certainly
does ooze evil from every part of his body. Of course, in this case, "evil"
and "awesomeness" mean pretty much the same thing. Blurr's main color has
been replaced with the traditional "evil black", though it's a very glittery
black that looks very nice. Blurr still retains his traditional dark and
light blue, they're just in lesser amounts-- and, oh yeah, they're glittery,
too. Heck, that's half of what makes Blurr so awesome-- besides the colors
just going together so well and being an original take on the character,
almost EVERY plastic color is glittery, which really makes him look almost
metallic. Certainly eye-catching, at the very least. Of course, the INCREDIBLY
well-done "lightning" deco on the sides of his vehicle mode increase the
awesomeness of it twofold as well, which is certainly a bonus as well.
The accent colors of metallic silver, red, orange, and yellow also work
very well in the amounts they're used.

     Blurr is another toy
to get a head remold, surprisngly enough. Considering he already has the
mold changes from
     <a href="cyblurr.html">
      Cybertron Blurr
     </a>
     , you'd have
thought they'd have kept the head, but instead they completely redid it
so that it wasn't overly large proportionally. Plus, he's got a REALLY
nice-looking scar/eye-patch over one eye that just looks like it's so darn
painful. Gotta love another eeevil touch like that.

     Some may complain about
the lack of articulation for this mold, but for me the incredible color
scheme, paint apps, glittery plastic, originality of the color scheme (while
still hearkening back to G1 Blurr), and the killer head remold easily,
easily overshadow that. My second-favorte of the 2008 exclusives, with
only
     <a href="bcprime.html">
      Optimus
     </a>
     beating him out. Highly recommended,
if you can afford the premium price.

       Before he was recruited by Prime, Blurr
was an eloquent and well-groomed lecturer. Though his demeanor hasn't changed,
Blurr looks more like a battle hardened warrior rather than the soft spoken
robot he is. Yet, Prime uses Blurr as an information hub first, and a soldier
second. Constantly on the move, Blurr is well equipped to intercept messages
from enemy couriers such as his heroic renegade cousin, Crasher. Though
no longer on the lecture circuit, Blurr now finds himself trading information
and unreleased protoform images with other archivists, desperate to get
an upper hand on his opponents. He often seeks to add any vital information
to his data banks in order to provide eloquent strategic infiltration plans
to his Autobot comrades. In vehicle mode, he can travel faster than most
Decepticons, speeding past them to the point where their microcircuits
fuse together, leaving them helpless. Once disabled, Blurr meticulously
disassembles their processors, slowly explaining the entire process in
excruciating detail to each victim.
