    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe TF1
'08 Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original TF1 deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy

     Pretty much all that's
"new" about this updated version of deluxe Bumblebee for the RotF line
has to with the mold-- as far as the color scheme, it's basically the same
as the first movie line's
     <a href="prembb.html">
      Premium line

     , but with
the more plain yellow of the original TF1 deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy.

     The mold changes are
what make this toy worth picking up, if you're interested enough in them.
The most notable one is that Bumblebee's right arm has been remolded from
the elbow down into his cannon-arm, which can hold a spring-loaded missile
inside it. Nothing too fancy, but kind of a cool remold given how many
times this mold's been released already. Bumblebee's head has also been
remolded to be even more movie-accurate-- I thought it was accurate enough
before, but now it's accurate down to pretty much the finest detail, including
his buggy eyes (which are honestly a little creepy, I have to say). Last
but not least, the front of his vehicle mode has been remolded to keep
it up-to-date with the actual Camaro's slight change in design since TF1,
what with the modified headlights and front grill.

     RotF deluxe Bumblebee
is a great figure and worth a pick-up if you want a cheap, accurate version
of the figure and for whatever reason didn't pick up any of the releases
of the mold for TF1. The remolds are pretty decent, too (except for the
googly eyes in robot mode), but by themselves they're not worth picking
up the figure again if you already have a previous version. (And if the
remolds ARE that big of a deal to you, get Alliance Bumblebee, a redeco
that makes the vehicle mode color scheme a little more interesting, instead.)

         Bumblebee here was one
of the two "preview figures" released before the main bulk of the ROTF
toys hit stores. Mold change wise, his vehicle mode is now styled to that
of the 2010 camaro. I like it plenty fine, nice to have some body changes
and it's pretty accurate. Robot mode wise, he has a new gun arm which is
okay, but I prefer the original gun as you could take it off so he had
two hands. The new head mold is more movie accurate, but as Beastbot mentioned,
those bug eyes are CREEPY. Silver paint is slightly more silvery than the
premium one.

         Overall I'd pass on
this Bee if you don't have a version of him yet and get one from the Hunt
for the Decepticons line or the upcoming 3rd movie line.

            Having chosen to stay with Sam after
the end of the battle for the AllSpark, Bumblebee made arrangements to
stay close to him at all times. It's been a pretty good deal. He gets regular
detailing, and as much high grade fuel as he needs. Plus, he gets to spend
time with Sam and Mikaela. His vocal processors still aren't fully up to
snuff, but he and his friends communicate just fine. If he ever misses
the action of battle, he can always give Ironhide a call and go Decepticon
hunting.
