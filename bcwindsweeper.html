    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Skydive.

     Windsweeper is an update
of the G1 Triggercon of the same name, and like most of the other components
of
     <a href="bcbludgeon.html">
      Thunder Mayhem
     </a>
     , he's the first update
this character has gotten since his original toy. And also like most of
the Thunder Mayhem members, FunPub did a dynamite job recreating his color
scheme and layout on this mold. His color scheme is mostly a dull rusty
red in vehicle mode and a light brown-tan in robot mode, with of course
a decent amount of the other main color appearing in the opposite mode
that it's dominant in as well. The two main colors go together fairly well,
being both complentary and contrasting against each other. Plenty of the
brown-tan paint is used in robot mode in particular to make Windsweeper's
color layout quite close to his G1 toy despite the plastic color breakup.
There's certainly some accent colors added, though-- the most obvious of
which is the unique purple-and-black paint apps on about half of each wing,
with some red and silver bits mixed amongst those main wings well. On the
back wings, there's purple and red stripes as well, though the red paint
right against the rusty red doesn't contrast enough to really stand out.
There's also little black bits on the nosecone, and a nice metallic brownish
gold paint used for the windows (and Windsweeper's eyes) that, again, both
complements and contrasts against the main colors nicely. As for other
accent colors, there's some purple on his lower legs, silver on his intakes,
and some silver and forest green on his chest, which again help to copy
(or at least homage) details from his G1 toy. He's also got some orange
on his face-- which honestly is a bit too light of a color on a face for
my liking, but I guess makes it stand out a bit more against the tan helmet.
For his hand/foot/gun weapon, he's got a nice dark perwinkle color, which
really pops against his main colors and gives him a bit more coloration
on the "cool" end of the color scheme. Unfortunately, for whatever reason
his double-barreled gun is that blah light milky gray color, but at least
it's only used on that one weapon.

     Windsweeper has no mold
changes, but he doesn't really need them-- the mold's headsculpt is a LITTLE
different from his G1 toy, but not enough where I think it justifies a
new headscupt. As an accessory, however, he DOES come with the "Matrix
of Malice", which is a diecast metallic gold matrix with light green transparent
plastic in the middle that was redecoed from the Matrix that comes with
     <a href="mpoptimus2.html">
      Masterpiece
Optimus v2.0
     </a>
     . It's a nice little accessory, but being that he has closed
fists, Windsweeper can't interact with it at all.

     TFSS Windsweeper is
another fine addition to the Thunder Mayhem team, updating a character
that was badly in need of one and using quite a few paint apps to make
him as accurate color-wise to his G1 toy as possible. All of the accent
colors help make his color scheme quite good, and the periwinkle hand/foot/gun
is also a nice touch. My favorite color scheme on this mold.

       Outside of his fellow Mayhem Attack
Squad member Grabuge, no one knows Windsweeper's deepest, darkest secret...
He was once an Autobot long before the Great War but due to his twisted
nature and need to cripple beings daring to share the sky with him, he
felt more at home within the Decepticon ranks. An exceedingly sick bot,
Windsweeper hopes to one day hear the same "voices" as Bludgeon so he can
execute the pain and suffering he believes the Matrix of Malice demands
of its possessors. Perhaps one day, when combined with the others, those
commands will finally be heard.

       Discarding his old "Trigger" tech he
had all those years ago, he now sports a heat-seeking missile launcher
to knock his prey out of the sky and a B-1B double-barreled laser cannon
to finish the job after the fiery crash leaves them twitching on the ground.
