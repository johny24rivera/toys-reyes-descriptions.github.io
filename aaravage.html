not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Ravage
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original RotF

     This version of Ravage
is, according to the people in charge of the deco job, meant to evoke when
he first emerges out of the ocean in the movie, hence the "Sea Attack"
descriptor. It certainly is a pretty shinny Ravage, I'll give it that much.
The silver flows extremely well into the pale light blue plastic and metallic
light silvery blue paint, and helps give him that "gleaming water dripping
off his armor" look. The bits of copper help to give the color scheme a
bit more variety, and look lovely. The light red plastic used for his "eye",
not so much, as it's kind of a pale red color that would've looked better
if it were a "purer" red. The light red paint on Ravage's "wings" in reentry
mode is more what I had in mind, as it contrasts very well with the black.
Speaking of the black, I kinda wish they had picked a different base color
for Ravage this time around. I mean, this is the third (or fourth, depending
on your counting-- it came out at around the same time as another redeco
of this mold) iteration of Ravage, and they're all mostly black. Maybe
a deeper blue, or a plastic version of the lovely bronze used for some
of the accent colors? There's certainly enough paint and color variety
in most places to keep that from making Ravage boring or easily mistaken
for another of his color schemes, but still... Ravage doesn't HAVE to be
mostly black.

     I'm a little disappointed
that Sea Attack Ravage has black as his one of his dominant colors again,
but the silver and light blue (along with the copper and red accents) go
together very well, and as a whole it's a quite eye-catching color scheme.
My favorite of the versions of this mold released singly, and the one I
think is the most eye-catching.

       Ravage has been beaten by Bumblebee
enough times to know he'll never win a straight fight. That's why he's
enlisted Insecticon to help him stalk the Autobot warrior. The two beast-bots
stalk through the shadows, remaining hidden and letting the brash, yellow
robot come to them.
