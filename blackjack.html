    Blackjack is a new member
of the Stunticons, but he's based off of the G1 Micromaster character of
the same name. This is particularly evident in his vehicle mode, which--
beyond the triangular spoiler-- is pretty much his G1 alt mode but a bit
rounder. The proportions in this mode are excellent, and the robot extras
are minimal-- the heels and feet are fairly noticeably on the back end
(though this is partially mitigated by the spoiler piece above them), and
there's a few obvious purple hinges below his front grill. Still, overall
these are easily overlooked. The mold detailing in this mode is pretty
minimal due to the sleekness of the sportscar, but there's intricate detailing
where appropriate-- all the little vents on the spoiler are impressive,
as is the level of detail put into the tires. Blackjack's main color--
a rather brownish, "impure" shade of black-- I'm not all that crazy about.
I would've preferred a much more "pure" form of black, not only for looks
but it also would've helped him blend in with
    <a href="cwmotormaster.html">
     Motormaster
    </a>
    a bit better, as well. The royal purple spoiler and stripes on the car
doors help to add a bit more color variety and make Blackjack blend in
thematically with the rest of the Stunticons, though what really makes
this color scheme are the metallic gold windows and silver headlights--
they really help add a bit of "bright" to an otherwise dark color scheme,
and the gold windows contrast as well as complement the brownish black,
given how gold and brown are near each other on the color wheel. If you're
willing, you can remove Blackjack's purple spoiler piece-- I will say that
the way the handle for it just sort of sits on top of the roof is a bit
unsightly-- though there's nowhere else to store it.

    Blackjack's transformation
is mostly straightforward-- pulling out the arms from the sides and separating
the back end into the legs-- though the way his whole canopy swings over
his back and breaks apart to make his chest, upper back, and head reveal
is pretty neat. In robot mode Blackjack's proportions are largely pretty
good-- his shoulders start a little lower than I'd like, his lower arms
are a bit square given that they're molded onto the inside of his car doors,
and his upper legs are just a bit too small in comparison to his large
lower legs, but none of these are deal-breakers. The only real vehicle
"extra" here is the shell of his roof and part of his front bumper that
hang behind his back, but they don't stick out much and don't get in the
way of articulation much either, so I can't say I mind it. The mold detailing
is much improved in this mode, with little mechanical bits like vents,
ridges, fake exhaust pipes, and the like all over his robot parts. The
color scheme is also broken up a bit better, with the purple making itself
known much more obviously in this mode, and broken up by more gold paint
apps on the knees and shoulders as well. The headsculpt is also very well-done,
and the purple head/blue visor/gold faceplate looks really nice and fitting
for a bad guy. That said, the facesculpt is certainly NOT G1 Blackjack's,
even if the coloration and vehicle mode largely is-- apparently this was
originally intended to be
    <a href="bcoverrun.html">
     Runabout
    </a>
    or
    <a href="bcrunamuck.html">
     Runamuck
    </a>
    and was changed late for some reason, but the headsculpt for them still
stayed. That said, it's not like Blackjack is a huge character, so I don't
mind. For articulation, Blackjack can move at the neck, shoulders (at two
points), elbows (at two points), hips, and knees, with most of these being
on ball joints, so he has a lot of good poseability-- his large lower legs
make him pretty stable, too. Blackjack's spoiler forms an (admittedly weak)
sword weapon in this mode.

    Blackjack has a third
"mode" that allows him to combine with the other Stunticons to form Menasor,
though his part is completely optional-- if you open up Menasor's chest,
there's a place to stick Blackjack on in car mode. The only difference
from car mode is that you plug the spoiler onto the top roof of the car,
as opposed to one end, to give him a more symmetrical look. It would be
a nice little extra for Menasor-- if the connection actually worked. Apparently
the pegs that Blackjack is supposed to hold onto are too thick and long,
and Blackjack falls off VERY easily. This is unfortunate, but at least
Menasor still looks perfectly fine with a closed chest.

    Combiner Wars Blackjack
is an excellent little Legends figure, looking pretty solid in both modes
and with few downsides. I do wish he was more black than brownish-black,
his shoulders are a bit too low, and his weapon is weak, but overall he's
one of my favorite Combiner Wars Legends figures. Highly recommended--
though more for the toy itself than as a part of any combiner, given how
incredibly weak his connection to Menasor's chest is.
