    Like the other mass release
FoC Combaticons, Vortex doesn't have a color scheme that is accurate to
the game, but is rather a "light" homage to the Energon Bruticus Maximus
component

    . The rather loud color
scheme of bright orange/red, purple, and black looks rather G2-ish in nature--
it's certainly not for everyone. The black helps to create a dark contrast
color, but there's not enough of it-- more of it, or perhaps a considerable
darkening of the purple, would've helped considerably. The bright yellow
on his two blade weapons looks great, though, like they're made of energy
or something. As far as the overall look of this mode goes, it's generally
pretty decent, with the major stuff important to the game design like his
small tail, long cockpit-gun, the blade-like nature of his propellers,
and the peculiar shape of his cockpit windows all very game-accurate. His
propeller can also spin quite freely with little resistance. This mode's
primary weak spot has to do with the the fact that much of his robot mode
is simply hanging below the main body of his vehicle mode without much
attempt to disguise it as something else. The purple parts that poke out
underneath his cockpit and below the main body of the helicopter are particularly
eye-catching in all the wrong ways. Because of all his extras underneath,
Vortex doesn't have any landing gear in this mode.

    Vortex's robot mode
is the more iffy of his two "main" modes, primarily due to the limitations
the toy inherently has in terms of budget and trying to be game-accurate
to a design that definitely didn't have a whole lot of thought put into
it at the video game level as to whether it would be physically possible
on an actual toy. Vortex's rotors pretty much shrink and go nowhere in
the game-- instead on this toy, they hang off his lower right arm at a
very awkward angle. I understand you have to do something with them, but
I would've much preferred them storing somewhere on his back or something.
As it is, the propellers-- which don't lock into place-- are my main annoyance
with this mode, and twirl around at the slightest touch (not to mention
they get in the way of his left fist). His hands are also quite weak, being
way too skinny, particularly at the elbow joint, which is also a bit crooked
to boot. His chest and head are the best parts of the mode, having game-accurate
mold detailing and great sculpting, particularly on the head. (The paint
colors together like this with the yellow making the highlights actually
works quite well here.) His feather-like "skirt" on his waist also looks
quite good, as well. His small tail from helicopter mode simply folds behind
his back and doesn't really get in the way or make him back-heavy, so I
don't mind it. His legs are also generally good and proportioned well,
though I wish he had more defined feet. For articulation, Vortex can move
at the slightly at the head (bumps to either side of his neck restrict
it a fair bit), as well as at the shoulders, elbows (at two points), waist,
hips, and knees (at three points)-- and a fair number of these are ball
joints. Thus, ignoring the oddity of his arms, he's fairly poseable, and
bits of his helicopter mode make for nice heels to keep him stable.

    Fall of Cybertron Vortex
is an okay mold, but it suffers from some pretty noticeable downsides in
both modes. In vehicle mode, he has a fair bit of underbelly kibble, and
in robot mode, his propeller gets in the way far too easily and his arms
are awkward. Overall the weakest of the FoC Bruticus limb molds, in my
opinion, among the various color schemes this mold has, I think this is
the weakest, as well.

      Few Autobots fear a fight against Vortex.
What they fear is being captured and at his mercy. He uses magnetic grapples
to haul helpless captives high into the sky. There he treats them to a
terrifying series of swoops, loops and dives before dropping them to their
doom.
