    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Hailstorm.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Hailstorm

     Mindset is a light homage
to a character that appeared briefly in the Marvel Generation 2 comics--
a bit of a Decepticon cannon fodder character, so it's quite nice he gets
his own little repaint-homage toy here. Just like in G2 comics, he retains
his mobile missile launcher alt mode because of the mold choice, though
the color scheme is a bit darker on this version (in his initial appearance
he was mostly white). A rather flat shade of light blue serves as his main
color, mostly accented by black and dark gray. The shade of dark gray plastic
used is a pretty nice shade-- it almost looks gunmetal-- but overall, this
color scheme doesn't particularly wow me. Oh, the black and flat blue contrast
against each other well and fit the alt mode, but there really needed to
be another main color there. Most of Mindset's paint apps go great with
their surrounding colors, however-- the red "lights" look great against
the blue, as does the metallic bronze, and the silver paint on the treads
and chest go well with the black, to boot. He's also got some nice metallic
gunmetal gray paint on his lower arms and chest, which just looks gorgeous
with the bronze. Since he's a "Reveal the Shield" toy, Mindset has an allegiance
rub symbol on the left side of his missile pack. Rub it to reveal he's...
wait, an Autobot?! B-but.... why? He's an homage to an obscure Decepticon...
there's NO Decepticon deluxes except for
     <a href="aartspack.html">

     in the entire Reveal the Shield subline... Why go this far but then make
him another good guy? Especially since the look of this mold doesn't really
fit "good guy"?!

memorable nor does it homage anything, so it's something I tend to forget
about.

     Mindset is rather confusing.
They homage an obscure Decepticon fodder troop and then make him an Autobot.
Usually little things like the allegiance symbol don't bother me, but....
urgh. His color scheme of light blue and black is also rather bland compared
to his predecessor Hailstorm, though it's by no means bad, and it's a good
mold. The paint apps certainly help, too. Recommended below Hailstorm,
but still a good purchase.

       Change does not sit easily with Mindset.
He likes things the way they are, and it is the weight of tradition that
drives his opposition to the Decepticons. They upset the balance of things,
an offense for which he can never forgive them. The only alteration with
which Mindset is comfortable at all is that wrought on the landscape by
one of his missile barrages.
