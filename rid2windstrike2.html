    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original version of
Windstrike. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
version of Windstrike

     Windstrike's single-pack
release pretty much is a polar-opposite of her initial release (in the
"Mini-Con Battle Pack" with Alpine Strike Sideswipe), with the main color
now being red instead of light blue. The red plastic used for most of Windstrike
is a really nice shade, being a bit semi-metallic in nature due to some
glitter mixed in with the plastic. The blue plastic that's on some minor
parts of the toy like her feet and handle is also pretty awesome, being
just a shade or so off from periwinkle and a really attractive shade in
and of itself-- and it goes excellently with the red, contrasting quite
nicely. Being a Mini-Con, her color scheme is pretty basic, so that's mostly
it for the "core" toy, but there is some silver on her weapon mode blade
and face, with a additional bit of light blue paint on her eyes. I do wish
there was a bit more paint on all that red in robot mode to break her colors
up some more, but in weapon mode the paint apps and more prevalent blue
make her color scheme look less uniform and better-looking there.

     Although no mold changes
have been made to the core toy, Windstrike's armor pieces are all-new for
this version, and are a transparent yellow color. I kinda wish they were
more of a "cool" color to better contrast against all the red, but it's
still a decent shade. For her armor pieces, Windstrike has a very blade-like,
edgy chest piece, with details that go around the gear on her chest and
make it look like she has a pretty nifty-looking knight helmet on. She's
got small blades that attach onto the end of each hand for some shivving
action (IF she could move her arms forward, that is), and two pieces connect
around her blade in weapon mode to make it a bit longer and wider, along
with giving it three points, two of them pointing sideways. (All armor
pieces can fit on her in both modes.)

     Windstrike's color scheme
is pretty neat for a simple little Mini-Con, and I think as far as the
core robot goes, she looks a bit better than her Battle Pack version. However,
although still decent-looking, her armor pieces aren't as impressive in
weapon mode as on her initial version. It should also be noted that this
wave of single-packed Weaponizers is quite difficult to find outside of
a few countries like Canada. Everything else being equal-- let's just ignore
the aftermarket price/availability of this version for this summary-- so
which version of Windstrike I would recommend depends on your priority,
primarily because of the armor pieces. If the robot mode is more important
to you, get this version. If you prefer the weapon mode, go for the Mini-Con
Battle Pack version.
