    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     Ramjet has several mold
changes from the Starscream mold to bring it more in line with how it looked
in the G1 cartoon-- for one, the wings have been remolded completely, being
weighted more towards the rear of the jet mode than the middle. This also
lets the wings sit to the side of the lower legs in robot mode (though
they can be folded back so they don't stick out quite as much). This leaves
only very small pieces of the wings actually resting behind the arms, which
means Ramjet has much more freedom in regards to his arm movement without
them pushing against the back of his wings like on the other two Classics
Seekers. The missiles in the missile launchers are also different, being
much bulkier than they are on Starscream. The nosecone in jet mode has
also been completely remolded-- it's smaller and stubbier now, to the point
where it looks a tad out-of-place. However, in robot mode this smaller
nosecone translates to a simplified head transformation, which yields the
"conehead" look that Ramjet had in the G1 cartoon-- something that even
the original G1 toy didn't accomplish, which is pretty darn cool. However,
the flipside of this simplified nosecone transformation is that if Ramjet
is looked at in vehicle mode, his head is right there underneath the nosecone.
That's a pretty small downside, though, since it's not visible normally.

     As far as his color
scheme goes, Classics Ramjet is faithful to his G1 self, but not slavishly
so. He shares the same white and dull rusty red colors in the same places
as his G1 toy did, but the black has been replaced with a dark gray. Personally,
I like the gray better, as it helps complement the "worn" feeling of the
rusty red a bit better. There's also the same nifty stripes on Ramjet that
are on the other (mass release) Classics Seekers, and they look just as
cool here as they do on the other two and help spice up the toy a bit.
The gold triangle added near the rear looks especially cool, and the use
of that same gold on part of the robot chest helps add quite a bit of needed
contrast to the robot mode as well-- it looks especially nice against the
silvery-white of the robot stomach.

     Classics Ramjet is a
pretty nice remold of the Seeker mold with a great homage to set him apart
from Starscream and
     <a href="battleautobotcity.html">
      Skywarp
     </a>
     . His conehead
may look a tad dorky, but it's definitely part of his character, and I'm
glad that Hasbro saw fit to include it. All of the colors also fit together
pretty nicely, though admittedly not as nicely as Skywarp's. Highly recommended.

       The Decepticons are known for fielding
their craziest warriors in the skies, but Ramjet really outclasses them
all. He's a born flier who loves nothing more than crashing. Sure, he's
got a whole rack of concussion missiles and argon lasers strong enough
to vaporize a Dinobot, but he'd rather skip all that nonsense and just
smash head first in to his targets - and anything else that gets in his
way. He's just as likely to smash his allies out of the way as he is to
destroy any Autobots in his path, but watching him plow through a battlefield
is so fun Megatron keeps him around anyway.
