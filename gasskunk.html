    Mold History
   </b>
   : Gas Skunk's mold was
originally used for the Beast Wars Transmetal 2 toy Stinkbomb, which came
out in 1999.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Stinkbomb Transmetal 2.

     At first glance, Gas
Skunk (STUPID name!) may seem to be identical to his predecessor, Stinkbomb.
This isn't the case, however. Gas Skunk has quite a bit more paint detailing
than Stinkbomb, and looks surprisingly better, considering he still has
the same basic color scheme, yellow and black. Stinkbomb's plain white
stripe becomes a cool silver on Gas Skunk. Gas Skunk's chrome silver replaces
Stinkbomb's chrome gold. Also, Gas Skunk's tail looks way cooler- it's
not just one chrome color anymore, it's chrome silver, with some chrome
bronze and black detailing! VERY cool! Gas Skunk also has some other, less
noticeable paint detailing, but those are the main differences. It just
becomes obvious, when you compare Gas Skunk and Stinkbomb, how much better
Stinkbomb's paint detailing could be. Unfortunately, some stability problems
were reported with Gas Skunk- some people say that his ball joints were
too loose, while still others say that his are too tight. On mine, most
of the joints are fine, but Gas Skunk's robot head is on a somewhat loose
joint that pops off rather easily. Still, despite these ball joint problems
on some, there isn't any real mold change to this toy, so he retains all
the negatives and positives of Stinkbomb in that respect.

     Although Gas Skunk and
Stinkbomb are near-identical toys, Gas Skunk has much better paint detailing,
and a wicked-cool tail. I'd pick Gas Skunk if I had to choose between the
two- and Gas Skunk is also a rather good deal, as he comes with Slapper
and Dark Scream for just $15 U.S.!
