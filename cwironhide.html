not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Offroad.

     Ironhide has a bit of
a movie-esque "update" to his vehicle mode this time around, with it being
more of a pickup truck as opposed to his G1-esque van mode. That said,
everything else about Ironhide is a G1-homage in its general nature; he's
mostly red and gray, with a fair bit of black as well. The red is a really
nice shade of the color, being semi-metallic in nature and just quite eye-catching--
certainly superior to a more straightforward red. The gray-- which shows
up in the robot mode-- isn't the usual boring light milky gray, thank goodness.
Like the red, it's a semi-metallic color (a definite plus), but is rather
brownish in its shade (a minus, in my opinion); the brownish shade just
doesn't work all that well with the red, if you ask me. The light metallic
silvery blue paint on the windows contrasts excellently with the red, and
I like how the fake "windows" on the sides of the chest are painted the
same color, in an homage to his G1 self having a window on the chest. The
silver on his engine-gun looks nice, but the gunmetal gray looks aces,
and is found in several places, like the "piston" details on his legs,
the sides of his abs, and the front and back bumper. There's also a line
of yellow around his vehicle mode-- another obvious G1 homage, and it looks
good and helps to vary up his color scheme more. I'm also a fan of the
Autobot symbol right above his crotchpiece in robot mode-- given the mold
detailing around there, it makes it look like a big belt buckle, which
fits Ironhide's personality perfectly.

     Ironhide does have a
new headsculpt, which is pretty much your classic G1 Ironhide look but
with a slightly bigger helmet proportionally. Given the combination of
that and the generally skinnier-than-usual robot mode profile for the character,
it makes it look like this is "young Ironhide". No other mold changes were
made to the toy.

     Combiner Wars Ironhide
has some great colors-- particularly the red and the metallic gunmetal--
and enough paint apps and different shades of colors to keep him looking
varied and interesting in both modes, with some nice G1 callbacks to boot.
That said, there's enough significant differences between this and his
G1 form-- such as a skinner form in robot mode, a different alt mode, and
different details on much of his robot mode-- where it doesn't come across
as a genuine Ironhide "update", but more like a reinterpretation of the
character as a "younger version". If this doesn't bother you-- or if you
just really want a combining Ironhide-- than by all means get him. Otherwise,
this is probably a pass, given how this mold suits other characters better
than it suits him.

        If Cybertron had cowboys, Ironhide would
have been a sheriff. A beloved and respected hero, Ironhide has been at
the front of the Autobot charge since the very beginning. Equal parts warrior,
bodyguard, and drill sergeant, his indomitable will and legendary toughness
continue to be an inspiration to the Autobot forces. His dual cannon is
one of the most interesting Cybertronian weapons-- capable of blasting
super-cool nitrogen and white-hot molten lead. The defining attribute of
Ironhide is his trithyllium-plated armor, which makes him almost impervious
to artillery fire and edged weapons. A steel will wrapped in impenetrable
armor? Yup-- that's why they call him Ironhide.

         Optimus Prime inspires tremendous loyalty
and awe in the Autobots, but there's no one they'd rather fight beside
(or behind) than Ironhide. The legendary toughness of this old warhorse
has steadied many a young soldier and turned the tide of countless conflicts
over the centuries. Forms either an arm or a leg of Optimus Maximus, the
combined form of Optimus Prime.
