    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Energon Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Energon

     Another homage repaint,
Leozack here originally appeared in the Japanese series
     <i>
      Victory
     </i>
     in
the late '80s. His color scheme and general alt mode is replicated here,
though the blue-green of the original has been changed to a more teal-ish
blue, probably to keep him a bit more distinct from his fellow convention
exclusive and mold-mate
     <a href="bcskyquake.html">
      Skyquake
     </a>
     . Regardless,
this color scheme looks pretty darn good, with the milky blue being a perfect
contrast color against the milky white. The particular shade of aquamarine
used for his transparent parts is quite fantastic-looking, and along with
the black helps to darken the color scheme a little as well. (The transparent
aquamarine looks particularly good on his sword parts.) Nothing looks better
than the metallic teal used on his tailfins, feet, and robot head, though--
oh man, what I would've give to have ALL of his teal parts painted in that...
The couple of remaining accent colors-- red, dark purple, and a bit of
pale gold on his cockpit-- help to round out a pretty darn good color scheme
and keep him pretty varied. The sole exception to this are the robot legs,
which are a bit plain, having no paint apps at all except for the very
upper tips of the hips and lower tips of the feet. Other than that, I really
don't have any complaints about his paint scheme-- I even rather like the
red used for the "battle damage" in vehicle mode, given the whole "experimental"
nature of his background.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon 2009 Leozack. Of note is that in addition to being
a Botcon 2009 exclusive, Leozack was only available ("free") if you bought
the expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked the set up in person
at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt going to be worth quite a lot
of money.

     If you've got the dough,
Leozack is a great homage, a great mold, and has a great color scheme.
Price is the only real deterrent to picking up, I'd say-- though, of course,
given his price and very exclusive nature, it IS a fairly big deterrent.

       Consumed by a hunger for self-improvement,
Leozack was one of the first Decepticons to volunteer for Skyquake's experimental
flight refit. While he is a mere foot soldier in Megatron's revolution,
and currently under the direct command of Skyqyake, Leozack has greater
ambitions. Through discipline and cunning, he hopes to one day rule the
Decepticons. To this end he has already begun plotting, hoping to lure
other Decepticons to his side. In combat, Leozack is an expert martial
artist and aerial combatant. Experimental combat upgrades give him immense
firepower, but at the cost of direct control of his weapons and transformation
system. As such, he must activate them using voice commands. His "Ultimate
Technique," the Jet Attack, unleashes vast destruction but leaves him almost
completely drained of energy. In addition, he often uses melodrama to keep
his foes off-balance during combat.
