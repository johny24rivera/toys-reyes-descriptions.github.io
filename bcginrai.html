not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Voyager Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Voyager

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Ginrai is an homage to
various Japan-exclusive fiery redecos of previous Optimus Prime toys, often
referred to as "Fire Guts Ginrai" (hence the nod in the bio). Regardless
of his origins, I love the fiery color scheme-- the fiery red and light
orange really complement each other well, while the red is still juuust
dark enough to contrast well against the orange and keep the color scheme
from being too loud. In keeping with the "fiery" theme, Ginrai has a fair
number of yellow paint apps too-- on his actual headlights, the faux headlights
on his waist in robot mode, and on the yellow vents on his lower legs.
Still, if these were the only colors, Ginrai would be a bit too light overall--
good thing there's a decent amount of black on him, which contrasts EXTREMELY
well with his orange and red while also oddly keeping in theme with his
fiery form, being the color of dark ash or something of the sort. Besides
the obvious bits on the wheels, the black is on the middle of his legs,
around the vents on his lower legs, on his rifle/smokestacks, on his upper
legs and faux grill on his waist, and on his (actual truck) grill. The
glossy shade of black that's used for paint looks particularly well-done.
To give Ginrai just a bit of a "cool" color to contrast against all the
fire, his transparent plastic on his windows and robot eyes is a dark transparent
blue-- another color that contrasts well against the light orange. There's
also just a TITCH of moderately dark blue paint on his side window details
that aren't translucent. There's also your normal robot requisite silver
on places like his wheel hubs, face, side vents in his truck mode, the
faux grill on his robot abs, as well as a few other minor places. The silver
serves as a decent color, but it doesn't contrast as well as, say, the
blue or black. I DO really like the bit of chrome silver added to the truck
grill, though-- it makes the truck look a bit more "real". To finish off
the color scheme, Ginrai has a big ol' light blue "Cybertronian Knight
with wings" sigil on his roof (which he can hold as a shield if you untuck
his truck side panels and fold in his fist in robot mode-- it looks a little
weird, but it's doable)-- and, being blue, it's another nice contrast color
against the orange. He also has a "normal" Knight sigil on his left shoulder,
in case you still weren't sure of his allegiance.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     BotCon 2014 Ginrai takes
one of the best Transformers molds of all time and paints it in a jaw-dropping
fiery color scheme, with just the right amount of each fiery color and
the black and blue to contrast against it. He's also got a pretty darn
good number of paint apps. This is the 2nd time that this mold has been
used in a "core" BotCon boxset, and I don't even care. It may not be the
most original idea the BotCon people have ever had, but it looks great
and-- if we consider only the combination of mold and color scheme and
not originality or character attachment-- is my favorite exclusive from
BotCon 2014.

       Forged in countless battles, Ginrai
is a warrior to his core. Considered a "Bot of Action", this old-school
veteran carries the rank of Knight Commander. Legends of his bravery in
combat have earned him the nickname "Fire Guts" from the troops. In robot
mode, he carries a double-barreled superconductor rifle and a particle
beam cannon that can transform into a shield capable of absorbing and dispersing
energy blasts of incredible magnitude.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Ginrai's experiences have taught him
one thing: always be prepared for the next conflict. This is why he has
taken leadership of Knight Alpha Trizer's new team of Cybertronian Knights,
a tribute to the original Knights of Cybertron, and a line of defense that
even he can trust. Being in a time of peace, many consider this to be paranoia,
but this gruff bot simply regards it as his duty. His methods constantly
clash with the more sagely Alpha Trizer, which frustrates Ginrai to no
end, especially when he can feel in his spark that there are serious threats
on the horizon.
