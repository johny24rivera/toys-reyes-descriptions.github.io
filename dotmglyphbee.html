    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Cannon
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Like the other deluxe
"Cyberglyph" repaints, Bumblebee keeps his normal color scheme of yellow,
black, and gray, but his main color-- a dull, slightly orangish yellow,
in this instance-- is of a really neat translucent shade. It makes the
toy practically glow in higher lighting, but the plastic has enough color
in it so that you can't see right through it-- it really is a dynamite
idea that I wish Hasbro would use more often. Bumblebee's gray plastic
is used in its usual places in robot mode, but thankfully it's of a milky-metallic
shade that looks right at home with the translucent plastic. The black
plastic also looks great against the yellow translucent plastic, and the
light blue paint used for the windows really pops. (That said, little bits
of yellow paint are used around the "edges" of some of the window pieces,
its presence a bit too obvious when it's right next to a piece of translucent
yellow plastic.) Bumblebee's got all the paint apps you'd expect-- his
front bumpers are painted, as are his headlights and taillights, wheel
hubs, and bits of his robot face. However, to fit in with the whole "Cyberglyph"
theme, he's also got dull yellow and silver Cyberglyph symbols all over
his vehicle mode. The symbols themselves look cool, but placed rather randomly
as they are with no overall "design" to help them flow together, it actually
looks like Bumblebee took a stasis nap or something and some graffiti artist
tagged him while he was sleeping. It's a bit too haphazard-- and I wish
a few more had carried over into robot mode, which is relatively bereft
of paint apps compared to the vehicle mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee.

     "Cyberglyph" Bumblebee
has some pretty nice translucent yellow plastic to mix things up a bit
for "another movie Bumblebee redeco", and his main paint apps play off
of his main plastic color well. However, the Cyberglyphs are used a bit
too often and seemingly randomly in vehicle mode, making the toy look a
bit more cluttered in that mode than it should; in some cases, less IS
more. Still, this is the best color scheme this mold's had, if you ask
me.

       The native language of Cybertron has
power. Some warriors, like Bumblebee, believe that it can grant luck and
protection in battle, so they inscribe the glyphs on their armor before
important conflicts. No one can prove that it works, but the glyphs often
glow mysteriously at critical moments.
