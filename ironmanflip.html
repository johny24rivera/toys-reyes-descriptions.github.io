    Iron Man's alternate
mode for the "Flip and Attack" line is a quinjet, according to the package--
which I suppose gives it enough leeway so it doesn't have to look all that
much like a real jet. Like the other toys in this subline, the alt mode
is pretty obviously just the mech mode on its back with the legs pulled
up, but admittedly it makes for a
    <i>
     slightly
    </i>
    more believable jet than
any kind of ground vehicle, what with the obvious wings and all. The cockpit
is a bit square and not very jet-like, however-- though of course, considering
how bulky the main body is, I suppose that's not a really big concern.
The mold detailing is a bit sparse when compared to other "Flip and Attack"
toys, but considering it's a sleek jet that also turns into what's supposed
to resemble a guy in a sleek mech suit, I suppose it's fitting enough.
A few places like the turbines in the wings have intricate detailing, though,
and the overall red/gold color scheme is, of course, classic Iron Man.
I would've liked a bit more gold paint on the wings and/or arms, though--
for a "Flip and Attack" toy, the paint detailing is a bit below-average.

    As for the mech mode--
to transform him, wind Iron Man back in his vehicle mode on a flat surface
until you hear a clicking sound on the wheels, then let it go-- the legs
will flip forward abruptly a couple seconds later, the weight and torque
of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Iron Man stand up into his
mech mode on his own. It only seems to happen about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time
in my experience, though-- the other times he just unfolds and rockets
forward a bit to clatter around on his front or backside. When the toy
comes through properly, however, it's a pretty neat gimmick. In mech mode,
Iron Man has the wings on his arms, but his overall design looks like the
other "Flip and Attack" toys, for better or worse. This means that, unfortunately,
he can only move back-and-forth at the shoulders, with no other articulation
whatsoever, not even neck movement. He doesn't have the crotch-sticking-out
problem that some of the other toys in the subline do, however, and though
the feet are a bit large for the gimmick, proportionally he does pretty
well in this mode. His headsculpt is pretty much "regular" Iron Man's,
which certainly fits a giant mech suit just as much as it does a human-sized
one. The eye slits are painted light blue-- which contrasts well against
the otherwise "warm" color scheme and rather vibrant shade of red plastic--
and the "power core" paint app on the chest has a nice effect where the
center is white and it fades to light blue around the edges. The rear thrusters
for the jet mode are on Iron Man's feet in this mode, thus making it believable
that he can still fly in this mode and mimicking Iron Man's "smaller suit",
which is a nice little touch.

    "Flip and Attack" Iron
Man is the best of the toys in the
    <i>
     Avengers
    </i>
    version of this subline
and second-best overall for the subline (behind
    <a href="spidermanflipjet.html">
     jet
Spider-Man
    </a>
    ), primarily due to this gimmick making for a slightly more
believable jet alt mode. The color scheme and detailing choices also suit
Iron Man well, though it would've been cooler if his red plastic was painted
or tinted a more metallic shade.
