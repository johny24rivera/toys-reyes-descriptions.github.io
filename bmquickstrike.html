    Beast mode is a wolf-
or at least, it's supposed to be. The overall body stature is just completely
wrong, not to mention the fact that the head, neck, and ears are too ridiculously
undersized. Looks more like a wolverine or something. Anyway, ignoring
this flaw, this mode is pretty decent. There is very nice technorganic
detailing, especially on the legs. The back part of Quickstrike's body,
however, doesn't look solid, and that's because it's not- it's actually
composed of his two robot arms and his robot head, all pressed together.
His robot head is also easily visible in this mode, which detracts from
the look a little bit. His spark crystal is visible if you look at Quickstrike
from the underside in this mode- it's on the inside of his back.

    Robot mode has a balance
of cool features and weird features. His arms are longer than his legs,
which is a bit odd, and he has no hands! His hands are actually just his
wolf paws tilted sideways. At least on some other feet-hand transformers
like
    <a href="longhorn.html">
     Longhorn
    </a>
    , hands were engraved on the sides,
but not in Quickstrike's case- they just look weird. There is also a noticeable
gap between his robot head the sides of his body, which looks odd from
above. On the other hand, I think the use of his wolf tail as his hair
in this mode was very creative- it makes him look a bit more menacing,
as his robot face itself makes him look rather old. Quickstrike's action
gimmick is a really cool switchblade that flips out of his left arm, allowing
for a quick jab at an enemy Vehicon.

    A decent toy in both
modes, but not particularly outstanding.

      Quickstrike operates best alone. Silent
and reclusive. Very intelligent. Extremely dedicated to Maximal cause,
though not entirely trusted by fellow warriors. Will only work with Blackarachnia
though there's no love lost between them. A true expert at hunting his
prey. Impossible to surprise. Can virtually escape Vehicon detection -
emits an electromagnetic emission shield and walks soundlessly. Disappears
in subdued light or shadow. Best weapon is enemies' anxiety, but sonic
howl can blow Vehicon auditory circuits. Loves music.
