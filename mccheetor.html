    Beast mode is a technorganic
cheetah. This is probably the worst Transformer beast mode I've seen yet.
It really just looks like some alien crouching on all fours. The cheetah
head really doesn't even look that much like a cheetah's, and more like
some weird alien creature's. The chest is also too ridiculously large proportionally,
and the large crests sticking out of hte back of Cheetor's ankles are too
large as well. As I've stated before, I'm not a fan of translucent plastic
being used for appendages, and it's used for the entirety of the upper
front legs. It doesn't look that good at all. There's also no tail in this
mode! There's only two major colors in this mode; a bit more detailing
would have been nice.

    Cheetor's robot mode
is little better. The transformation is ridicuously simple; just a simple
head flip and then stand him up. It shows, too. The legs are very short
proportionally, and aren't very pleasing to the eye. The chest looks even
larger proportionally in this mode than in the beast mode. Still, the detailing
is rather good for a Happy Meal toy, at least.

    A rather horrid toy
all around. I recommend this only for completists.
