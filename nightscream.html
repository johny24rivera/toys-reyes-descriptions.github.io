    Beast mode is a bat.
This toy is absolutely huge when compared to previous Ultra toys. In fact,
Hasbro could easily pass it off as a super-sized toy. With his wings fully
extended, Nightscream's total wingspan is about two feet! Yowsa! Not that
a toy this big for a mere twenty bucks is a bad thing. However, I do have
a complaint about the scale. On the show, Nightscream is a relatively small
Maximal, but the only toy of him is the second largest Beast Machines toy
there is, second only to

    .
It would have been nice if a smaller version of him was made. The bat mode,
overall, is pretty week. The legs are entirely too long for a bat's, and
BATS DON'T HAVE HANDS! The back half of the main body is also poorly constructed.
The half of the legs don't fit together with the sides that well, not to
mention the fact that the rear end parts don't fit together either and
do a rather poor job of hiding the robot head. However, the wings look
really cool, since they're only covered half way down with "skin". They
fold together pretty nicely, too. The long ends could present a poking
problem, though, so parents, keep an eye on your young ones if they play
with this figure. The detailing on this figure is rather odd; in certain
places, such as Nightscream's beast mode back, it is exquisite, yet in
others, such as the feet, there is much to be desired. Thus, I'd say overall,
Nightscream's detailing is average. A rather cool, although flawed, feature
is the disc launcher located in Nightscream's back. Pull it out and turn
it around, and the red light emitting from the launcher focuses through
Nightscream's clear eyes, making his eyes glow red. A very cool effect,
but Nightscream's large ears block the discs from shooting most of the
time, unless you turn his head down, but then it just looks stupid. It's
also very hard to push the launcher back into the body without it firing
again; you may as well just take the discs out, push the launcher in, and
then load the discs back in. Another rather troublesome problem in this
mode is that the tab in the shoulders where the wings are supposed to lock
in really don't hold that well, so it's hard to keep the wings in a position
that makes them seem one with the arms. Nightscream's orange spark crystal
is visible under his rear in this mode.

    Nightscream's "Claw
Attack Mode" has got to be one of the stupidest-looking alt modes to date.
"Hey, let's stand the bat mode up on his wings and bring his legs forward!"
Yeah, what fun.... Do I really need to point out anything more with this
mode?

    Nightscream's robot
mode is quite an improvement over the show version's. The wings are not
attached to his ankles, like they are on the show, but rather to his arms,
which looks nicer overall. However, although I'm not usually one to complain
about simple transformations, Nightscream's is overly simplistic for such
a large toy. Legs become legs, arms become arms; it's getting kind of boring
at this point, really. His hunchback is almost non-existent on the toy,
which is definitely a plus, though. His face still looks rather ugly- the
one stalk of hair and the ugly face are still there. The transparent plastic
used for the neck and ears amplifies the ugliness even more, in my opinion.
Nightscream's feet are also a bit small proportionally, so it's a bit harder
to get him to stand up in this mode then I'd like it to be. You have to
bend his legs back into an awkward position to get him to stand up right.
I'm also not a big fan of the use of transparent plastic in his arms and
legs- transparent plastic used in the main body does NOT look that good.
A neat feature in this mode is that the wings on the arms can be folded
back to create some sort of "cloak", which accents his creepiness more
and makes him almost look like some type of young mutant vampire. It does
get in the way of movement a bit, though. Another nice touch is the long,
spindly fingers, which definitely add to the whole vampire feel. The fingers
almost look like bones, in fact. As large as they are, individual finger
articulation should be incorporated, but it isn't; only the thumb can move.
Ah, well, at least the hands are made of that bendy plastic, so they can
be moved a little. One thing I find that is absolutely eye-candy in this
mode is Nightscream's upper back- backbone and technorganic details are
molded into the other side of the transparent plastic, definitely giving
it a realistic feel to it. Nightscream's disc launcher can also work in
this mode, although it looks rather odd. You can flip up his chest panel
and pull it out, so that he, in effect, is firing the disks out of his
chest.

    A so-so toy overall;
however, for the most part, appearance and design are not its strong points,
especially in beast mode. I can see why this toy is a shelfwarmer- for
as big as it is, it could have been much better.

      As the first known survivor of Megatron's
conversion-freezing virus, Nightscream has brought a new optimism to the
Maximal cause. He's living proof of the organic history of Cybertron. In
Beast Mode, boasts unmatched speed and aerial maneuverability. Sonic pulses
can blast through all alloys. Razor-sharp claws pierce through solid metal
with ease. Robot mode gives him even more speed and maneuverability. Can
drain enemy's energy and power himself with it. Also creates audio illusions
which distract and confuse Vehicons, making them vulnerable to attack.
