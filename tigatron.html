    Beast mode is a snow
tiger. Barely any extras at all in this mode, just his gun on his belly
and his upper part of his back legs give away that heÂ’s a robot. His robot
head is also visible through a hole in his lower neck. This is a repaint
of
    <a href="cheetor.html">
     Cheetor
    </a>
    , although his body structure isn't
much like a tiger; more like a panther or cheetah. Once again, the poseability
is very limited in this mode, as only his back legs can move.

    Robot mode is very nice,
except for the tiger legs on his back get in the way, and his tiger face
on his stomach sticks out and looks odd. Other than that, this mode is
very good-looking, and this beast was well-designed, with a water-squirting
gut gun and his tail flipping back to reveal a rather odd-looking laser
gun. He has two faces, a mutant bug-like face and his face on the TV show.

    Cheetor is slightly
better, but still a nice transformer.

      Appointed by Optimus Primal for northern
polar sector reconnaissance. Roams the frozen tundra in animal form, but
quickly converts to robot mode for battle, removing its titanium tail and
converting it to a powerful quasar cannon to vaporize Predacons. Powerful
and considered fearless, Tigatron is also equipped with a toxic fluid blaster
that stops enemies cold, rendering their bodies useless!
