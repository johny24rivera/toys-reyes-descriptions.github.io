    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" deluxe Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the

     Night Shadow Bumblebee's
"core" redeco idea isn't anything new; it takes Bumblebee's main colors
of black and yellow and flips the amount of them and their placement. However,
in place of the yellow there's now gold on this version; some of it is
gold paint like on the two stripes on his roof, around his side windows,
and on a few other minor places, while some of it is "gold" plastic (actually
more of a caramel-esque tan), used for much of his robot mode. It's a really
nice twist, as the gold looks really good-- particularly the paint, though
all of it looks nice against the black. It gives this Bumblebee redeco
a bit more of a "royal" feel. That's not all, though-- much of Bumblebee's
"feather" details have been painted silver, as have his wheel hubs, front
grill and headlights, exposed engine, robot feet, and part of his face.
This is another color that both contrasts excellently with the black and
also complements the gold, to boot. All of the blue missiles and the extending
parts of Bumblebee's bow have also been changed in color to a rather nice
pale dull blue, with gives him a dominant light color in vehicle mode that
also contrasts against the black well. There's also just a tad of metallic
silvery blue on the shoulder spikes, to help them fit in color-wise with
all of Bumblebee's firepower. This said, as impressive as all these colors
and paint are, there are two places that could've used a tad more paint;
specifically the sides of the front hood and the eyes. Having black lifeless
eyes on 'Bee just looks wrong.

     No mold changes have
been made specifically to Night Shadow Bumblebee, though he has the same
mold changes that were made to the

     Night Shadow Bumblebee
is my favorite version of the mainline deluxe Prime mold, whether we're
talking the Beast Hunters remolds or the original "Robots in Disguise"
versions of the toy. Sure it still has the same issues in robot mode that
the mold has always had, but the color scheme looks VERY nice, using the
usual "flipped colors" idea for Bumblebee redecos and replacing the yellow
with some nice shades of gold, while also adding in some silver and blue
to help make the color scheme look even more interesting. If you get one
version of this mold (and don't care about show accuracy), I'd make it
this one.

        After the injuries he suffered in the
raid on the derelict starship, Bumblebee understands why Autobot Ratchet
has him on light duty. That doesn't make patrol alongside Prowl any less
frustrating. He feels fine! So why can't he be out with the rest of his
team kicking Predacon tail? With Predaking defeated, the Autobots are free
to chase down the rest of the beasts, and hopefully neutralize them before
their leader even realizes they're alive. And yet here Bumblebee is, driving
down remote backcountry roads alongside Prowl, who wouldn't know action
if it raced up and dented his fender. Just as Bumblebee decides he's in
for the most boring mission ever, there is a crack like thunder from the
sky. Then Megatron streaks down out of the stratosphere, his cannon firing
a pulse of energy that blasts the top off a nearby mountain.
