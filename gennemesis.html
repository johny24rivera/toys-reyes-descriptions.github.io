       Spinister is a "light"
homage to the G1 character of the same name (who, interestingly enough,
had Targetmaster partners; oh, how the tables have turned, Spinister).
His thoroughly unrealistic color scheme certainly matches his late-'80s
debut, but for this release it's been muted, with the pink being replaced
with purple and the teal being replaced with a much darker, duller grayish
blue. Both colors still go together quite well and stand out on a shelf,
though, and the teal helps him fit in a bit more with Nemesis Prime. Combined
with a few black parts like his chopper blades, Spinister also has a fair
amount of grayish blue paint in both of his modes, so neither looks too
"one-tone"-- something I'm quite grateful for on a toy this tiny. Spinister
also has a few dull dark red paint apps on a few robot parts like his chest
and head visor; it makes for a decent enough accent color, though a lighter
red would have provided Spinister with a "light" color for better contrast.

          Nemesis Prime follows
the tradition of being the "evil" redeco of Optimus Prime with a primarily
black-and-gray color scheme with some teal and red highlights. Nothing
in terms of the general colors is different from the usual, but the shades
of said colors are a little different from normal. The black is... well...
black, so not much to say about that. The gray-- thankfully-- isn't of
the super-blah light milky gray, but the slightly bluish shade of light
gray Nemesis Prime has is still of a rather boring, flat shade, and I wish
it had been speckled with some glitter/metallic shading. It still contrasts
nicely enough with the black, as does the fairly ample amount of silver
paint on Nemesis. The red on this version of Nemesis Prime is considerably
duller than normal, which I'm not a fan of, as it doesn't make the windows
pop visually as much as they should (the eyes still look good, though).
What really "saves" this color scheme is the more-than-usual amount of
teal, though as with the red it's of a duller shade, more of a grayish
blue. Used on the feet, kneecaps, fists, headlights, and the faceplate
all gives a bit more color to those areas beyond the otherwise monochrome
shading of Nemesis Prime and is appreciated-- but it's still of a duller
shade than normal, and a brighter teal would have done the job better.

            The Nemesis Prime &amp;
Spinister set is a nice "evil version" of these molds, both of which are
considerably better-than-average for their sizes among the Generations
Legends 2-packs. Spinister is quite nice, and sticks out among a shelf
in terms of his color scheme (even if it's dulled down a bit from his G1
scheme). Nemesis Prime isn't bad by any means, but the choice to replace
his two non-monochrome colors with considerably duller shades makes him
lack his usual visual pop. Normally I like Nemesis Prime repaints better
than their original Optimus Prime versions, but not in this case because
of these duller shades.

              The silent assassin Spinister is more
intelligent than most Decepticon lackeys. Subtle enough to keep his personal
agenda a secret from his superiors, he was last seen travelling to Cybertron
in the company of Nemesis Prime, dark clone of Optimus Prime and servant
of the World Eater Unicron. Although the purpose of their alliance remains
a mystery, their success can only spell disaster for the Autobots and their
allies on Earth.
