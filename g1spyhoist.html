    Mold History
   </b>
   : This mold was created
especially for the X-Brawn Spychanger mold for RiD, and it's been repainted
here as Hoist.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the X-Brawn Spychanger.

     Hoist is less of a faithful
re-creation of his
     <a href="g1hoist.html">
      G1 self
     </a>
     in vehicle mode than
most of the other G1 Spychangers, but there's still some unmistakable nods
given. He still has the same general color scheme- green and black, with
some orange used for the rear- and he has the same black-and-yellow stripe
running down his sides that the G1 toy did. He's not a tow truck, though,
but rather a SUV- not too much of a stretch, as they're still both rough-and-tough
vehicles, but they're different vehicle nonetheless. Hoist's stripes are
not actually paint apps, but pre-applied stickers, and given that they're
rather hard to apply effectively in a straight line due to the various
mold details, they end up being applied slightly crookedly, which ruins
the effect a little. Hoist's robot mode is more of a result of his car
mode coloration than an actual homage to G1 Hoist, and it looks absolutely
nothinng like its predecessor in anything but color scheme. Even the paint
apps are the same color as Spychanger X-Brawn's- and although they look
good on Hoist, I would have preferred them to be different colors to spice
things up a little. But Hoist still has an amazing variety of colors for
such a small toy.

     Hoist's vehicle mode
is an A+ effort, and looks very nice. It seems the designer skimped out
a bit on the robot mode, but it still looks nice, and I'd recommend it
over the milky-gray X-Brawn spychanger, just because it's more interesting
to look at.

       Hoist is first on the scenewhenever
an Autobot is injured in the line of duty. His personal mission is to make
sure that each of his comrades operates at peak efficiency levels at all
times. Though his primary function is maintenance and repair, he'll gladly
convert to robot mode to take on a Decepticon adversary.
