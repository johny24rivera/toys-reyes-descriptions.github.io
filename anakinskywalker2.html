    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Saesee Tiin

     The Episode II Starfighter
mold has been repainted again, this time in
     <a href="anakinskywalker.html">
      Anakin
Skywalker's
     </a>
     traditional yellow-and-gray colors-- similar to the colors
used on his Episode I Starfighter toy, but with considerably more yellow
and less gray. I'm not a big fan of the color yellow, but it contrasts
with the gray fairly well, and in my opinion looks better than the loud
orange used on Saesee Tiin. Besides, the gray also becomes considerably
more apparent in Mech mode, and Anakin has a ton of paint apps, as well.
The rusty red works particularly well against the other colors, but the
brownish black is also an excellent accent color, too.

     Anakin comes with a
head remold, which is one of the best SWTF heads to date, in my opinion--
it's got a youthful, humanoid look to it, but it's not so close to Anakin's
face that it doesn't look "robotic" enough-- no robo-hair or anything like
that. Also, Anakin Skywalker is the first entry in the Star Wars Transformers
line with Clone Wars packaging, which means that no miniature pilot figure
is included with the toy.

     Anakin Skywalker's main
color may be a bit bright, but he's got loads of great paint apps and overall
his color scheme works quite well. I still don't like it as much as
     <a href="obiwan2.html">
      Obi-Wan
Kenobi
     </a>
     , but it's a step above Saesee Tiin, I think.

       Space battle during the Clone Wars is
certainly a harrowing experience, especially for the most gifted pilot
in the galaxy, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin is given some of the most challenging
flight missions of any Jedi and handles them with great ease. Using the
power of the Force, Anakin changes into Jedi starfighter mode and takes
on an entire squadron of droid tri-fighters by himself!
