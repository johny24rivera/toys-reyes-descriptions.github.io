    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Saesee Tiin

     Unlike the

     update to the Episode II Starfighter figure, "Clone Wars"
Anakin Skywalker here is more of a re-release than re-done version. The
paint apps et. al. are exactly the same as on the initial version of the
     <a href="anakinskywalker2.html">
      Anakin Skywalker
     </a>
     Episode II Starfighter
toy, so see my review of that toy for my comments on his general color
scheme. However, on this release he's missing that orbital docking booster
thing. So you get substantially less toy for the same amount of money.
Hooray?

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Anakin's head is in
slightly more "Clone Wars-ish" proportions, but that's the only mold change
if you don't count the removing of several parts.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     In summary, DO NOT WANT.
Get the older versionÂ  with boosters and missile launchers if you
must have an Anakin Skywalker Episode II Starfighter toy. This release
brings nothing substantially new to the table, and in fact, a lot less.

       Anakin is given some of the most challenging
flight missions of any Jedi during the Clone Wars, and he handles them
with ease. Using the power of the Force, Anakin changes his Jedi starfighter
into mech mode and takes on an entire squadron of droid tri-fighters by
himself!
