    Terri-Bull is the slightly-changed
name for G1 Horri-Bull, a G1 smaller Headmaster like
    <a href="crashbash.html">
     Squeezeplay
    </a>
    .
(Horri-Bull was taken but Terri-Bull wasn't? Really?!) Anyways, in Titan
Master form, Terri-Bull has mostly generic detailing-- fairly square legs,
arms that have little fists molded into them but otherwise are flat slabs,
and a few minor vent-like details on the main body. The head is fairly
generic as well, with a blue helmet and a yellow face with the usual eyes,
nose, and mouth. The blue plastic used on this Titan Master set is a VERY
nice dark milky blue with a bit of glitter in it to make it semi-metallic,
and it's definitely my favorite part of this color scheme. Unfortunately
the light milky gray plastic used for the legs and the main body is actually
an ugly shade of light grayish brown, and doesn't look nice as a color
at all. It contrasts with the blue okay, I suppose, but it's just a bad
plastic color. The yellow paint on the face is appreciated, but otherwise
there's no paint in Titan Master mode, which is unfortunate. Like all Titan
Masters, Terri-Bull can move at the head, back-and-forth at the shoulders,
hips, and knees (the latter two as one, since the legs are pinned or molded
together). In its head mode, Terri-Bull now much more closely resembles
Horri-Bull's head, with a bit of modernization thrown into the mix with
a few more details along the sides of the helmet surrounding Terri-Bull's
tan faceplate and red eyes, both of which contrast against the blue well
and are MUCH better colors than that grayish brown.

    Terri-Bull's accessory
has a tank mode as its first mode, and this mode is remarkably solid for
such a small toy. The proportions are largely pretty good, and Terri-Bull
can slot his feet right in back of the turret and plug into two little
pegs there to hold him in place so he can "ride" the tank. Most of this
accessory is more of that lovely dark swirly blue, but unfortunately the
two double-barreled guns and a few minor parts are that ugly grayish brown.
That said, on the positive side, it does complement the tan paint used
on the turret fairly well. The mold detailing is quite intricate, with
not only vents and "bolts" all over the figure, but also incredibly detailed
treads-- it's a real shame none of this is brought out in paint, which
is completely absent in this mode outside of the turret. Each of the turret's
two guns can move up-and-down individually, but sadly the turret can't
rotate because of the transformation. There aren't any wheels on the bottom
either, so the tank can't roll.

    The tank's other mode
is... odd. You turn it upside down and flip out wings and cockpit to make
it a... jet, I guess. The wings are laughably small and oddly shaped, though,
and the guns being on the bottom side of the cockpit with the articulation
that they have looks rather odd. The cockpit itself does look nice, though--
it's nice and aggressively angular, as befits a Decepticon accessory. The
cockpit windows are painted black, and there's a Decepticon symbol on one
of them, but otherwise there's no paint at all in this mode-- again, this
especially a shame given how many mold details there are, but at least
the blue plastic looks so darn good. Terri-Bull can slot into a cavity
on the top near the back of this mode, with his head plugging into the
back end of the cockpit to essentially become "one" with the vehicle--
just ignore those little grayish brown legs sticking out, I guess.

    Terri-Bull's weapon
mode is an afterthought at best. Flip up the "wings" of the jet mode and
then pull out a handle near the back end-- that's it. It's a gun with a
jet cockpit above it. Weird, and honestly not worth it.

    Titans Return Terri-Bull
has a great tank mode, oodles of mold detailing, and a pretty main color--
the Titan Master figure itself has some pretty good detailing on the head
mode, too. However, the jet mode is a joke, and the weapon mode an even
worse joke-- plus the light grayish brown plastic is ug-ly. This is one
of the weakest Titan Master sets if you want to do anything with it other
than keep it in tank mode.
