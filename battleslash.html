    Battleslash's alt mode
is a helicopter, and meant to hearken back to one of the two different
vehicles that formed G1 Battletrap's robot mode. Battletrap was a Duocon
in G1, which meant that two different vehicles formed his robot mode, but
without individual robot modes of their own. For Power of the Primes, Hasbro
has fixed that, with the top half now its own character,. Anyways, in helicopter
mode, it's still definitely recognizably a helicopter, but it suffers a
bit from having to form both an individual robot mode AND half of a larger
robot. This is especially apparent around the front-middle area of the
'copter, where everything seems kinda "squished" into the upper half of
the toy, since the lower half contains parts needed for the other modes.
As such, the cockpit is a bit shallow up on the top there, and the middle
section is just mostly robot parts, with the upper arms on the top and
the combined mode arms and parts of the waist forming the bottom part.
Instead of there being a proper front "nose" to the helicopter, there's
a square opening for
    <a href="roadtrap.html">
     Roadtrap's
    </a>
    head for the
combination, which looks a little odd but isn't as big of a deal as the
"squished" proportions on the top. On the back end, you can see Battleslash's
robot feet, but mostly only because they're painted and not because they
don't fit in with the silhouette of the pieces around it. The propeller
on the top can spin freely, but it's a REAL close gap in between it and
the top of the helicopter, so if the arms aren't set EXACTLY right it'll
slightly catch on one of them. The mold detailing is a little basic for
a Generations toy, at least in this mode-- there's some little vents and
ridged lines here and there, along with details like the tail propeller
molded in-- but nothing particularly intricate. The color scheme is mostly
a slightly "dirty" shade of off-white, with a decent amount of black in
the middle of the toy. There's two different shades of blue-- a light shade
used on the cockpit windows, and a slightly darker, more moderate shade
used for some other details like his robot feet. In this mode, there's
also some red bits on the top sides of the cockpit piece, and some dark
purple bits on the middle sides. Painting the helicopter tail blades would've
been appreciated, but otherwise he's got a decent amount of paint and color
breakup.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The transformation is
a bit more complicated than normal for a Legend-class toy; the arms fold
out from the sides and there's a couple of different odd folds you have
to do on the shoulders due to how they also have to move for the combined
mode. With the arms out, you split the helicopter tail into halves and
then down to form the hips and legs, while the front of the helicopter
folds behind the back. The end result is a fairly solid robot mode overall--
first though, let's talk about the couple of downsides. For one, due to
the fact they also form the combined mode shoulders, Battleslash's hips
are pretty wide and his legs spaced a bit further out than they should
be; it looks a little weird. The front connector section that becomes the
helicopter nose just hangs off his butt without pegging in anywhere, and
is definitely his most obnoxious piece of kibble. (He's also got the halves
of his tail propeller pieces on the sides of his lower legs, but they're
relatively small and not that big of a deal.) His helicopter blade hanges
off his right lower arm, and forms a nice little spinning blade-weapon;
I don't mind it. The back is essentially made of the combined mode chest,
so even though it's odd for a helicopter TF to have the cockpit on the
BACK of the robot mode, it still works here. The head is rounded like a
helicopter pilot's helmet, with a little rounded vent on the top and a
silver "normal" face with dull orange eyes. There's also a Decepticon symbol
and black lines on the chest and some purple paint around some circular
details on said chest, but other than that no new paint apps have been
added; he's still largely offf-white with some black. It worked for vehicle
mode, but here I would've appreciated another paint app or two on the legs
and/or arms. For articulation in this mode, Battleslash can move at the
neck, shoulders, at the elbows (at two points), hips, and knees, with most
of these being ball joints, so he's quite poseable.

    Battleslash is the better
of the two 'bots that make up Battletrap. He's still got some compromises
made to the helicopter mode, for sure-- particularly around the middle
section. However, he's got a pretty intuitive transformation, and a largely
solid robot mode with only some minor kibble/proportion issues. I'd still
mildly recommend him even if you don't want to form Battletrap, which I
can't say about Roadtrap.

       Battleslash forms the
top half of Battletrap, while Roadtrap forms the bottom half. Roadtrap's
transformation to form Battletrap is pretty simple; you basically just
take his vehicle mode, fold out the waist and upper legs from the back
end, and then split the rest of the vehicle mode in half while rotating
up those front bits to form the feet. Battleslash's transformation is a
bit more complicated, with the arms folding forward on the chest and "catching"
the helicopter blade in between them to form the back; the legs folding
up and to the side to form the arms for Battletrap; and the main body basically
turning around and switching heads. Combine them both at the waist, and
you've got Battletrap!

       Battletrap looks a lot
cleaner than I was expecting, given that there's two whole new robot modes
they had to fit into this Duocon design while still making him look like
an updated G1 toy in the combined mode. Is there kibble? Sure-- the biggest
being that his lower legs/knees are a bit too oddly bulky, given they have
entire halves of Roadtrap's robot chest on the front of each of them. Battleslash's
arms are also pretty obvious on the back, but they don't get in the way
of articulation and largely stay out of the way-- plus, they keep the helicopter
blade in between them and out of the way, so with that added functionality
they're a minor downside. There's also the bits of the helicopter tail
hanging off the lower arms (along the Battleslash's feet coming off the
bottom of Battletrap's fists), but these are minor, especially given the
size and the gimmickry. That kibble aside, Battletrap looks pretty solidly
well-proportioned overall. Given that he's two Legends combined, he can
go toe-to-toe with any Deluxe, size-wise. The connection point between
the two figures is very solid and stable, and the way the helicopter details
are used on the chest help accentuate his form pretty well. The truck bits
for feet also work pretty well, too. Given how each of his halves have
two other modes, there's not much revealed in this mode that isn't revealed
in the individual toys, except for the combined mode head-- Battletrap's
noggin is spot-on solid and a very crisp "upgrade" of his G1 design's head.
He's got a rather complicated amount of detailing on his "helmet" with
small side antennae and a flat forehead, a silver visor, and a light blue
"normal" face that complements his darker blue head nicely. The individual
color schemes make it obvious that Battletrap consists of two seperate
toys, but they still complement each other well-- white, blue, and black
form a pretty decent color scheme overall, and putting a bit of blue on
Battleslash and a bit of silver on Roadtrap-- along with the black shared
between them both-- helps to unify the colors some, too. For articulation,
Battletrap can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows, rotation at the waist,
and movement at the hips (at two points), knees, and ankles (at three points).
He's quite stable, and thus can get into some pretty good poses-- except
for his knees, where all that kibble can clash together at more extreme
angles.
      </font>
      <br/>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       PotP Battletrap is a
great combined mode, with great proportions, articulation, and colors,
and doesn't suffer much for his individual components having their own
robot modes-- minus the big bits of kibble around his knees. An easy recommendation.
