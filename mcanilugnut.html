    Lugnut's vehicle mode
is very good, particularly for a Happy Meal toy. All of the right colors
are there, and unlike most other Animated Happy Meal toys, he doesn't suffer
from a huge lack of paint apps, with the teal on the wings and tailfin
helping to break up the purple, along with his yellow-striped green-blue
bombs. Granted, there could certainly be MORE paint detailing-- particularly
on the cockpit-- but it's not bad. The proportions are also quite good,
in some ways even better than his mainline

    , what with the longer wings.

    In robot mode, however,
the solid look falls part. It's extremely awkward in really every aspect--
his head is tiny and waaaaay towards the back of his enormous chest without
having any real hunch, his arms have no real elbows and his bombs don't
open to become claws, and his legs are way too long without really looking
much like legs, given their "uni-leg" status that hasn't been seen for
quite some time, plus the lack of any leg mold detailing. Honestly, it's
hard to come up with ANYTHING positive to say about Lugnut's robot mode,
other than that it's easy to transform, I guess. As for articulation he
can move at the elbows and back (but not forwards) at his uni-knee, but
that's it.

    It's rare for a Transformer
to have such drastically different modes as Happy Meal Lugnut. His plane
mode is good in pretty much every way you can reasonably expect for a Happy
Meal toy (aside from a lack of paint detailing on the cockpit), but his
robot mode is just horrid and incredibly awkward-looking in every way.
Only recommended for little kids who want an easier-to-transform Lugnut
than the Voyager class version.
