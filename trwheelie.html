    Wheelie has gotten a
few toys over the past several years, but this one is meant to fit in with
the other relatively recent Scout class versions of the G1 "Minibots".
In vehicle mode, Wheelie is pretty darned accurate to how he looked in
the G1 cartoon; it's definitely not a realistic car, but rather a very
very streamlined, curvy, futuristic car. Proportions-wise this mode is
pretty spot-on, and there's barely any robot mode extras (the only one
being the bottom of the head on the back end where you would expect an
exhaust pipe or something instead). The dark translucent black bit in the
center can also lift up for you to stick a Titan Master in there, if you
so decide to. However, it's rather difficult to get a Titan Master set
in securely, because this vehicle mode comes apart VERY easily, which is
definitely my biggest issue with it. There's several tabs, but they're
almost all too shallow to really hold the parts together. As such, play
with Wheelie much and put much pressue anywhere and he starts to pry apart--
even if you lightly touch everything back in place, there's still several
obvious "lines" across the mode, as you can see in the pic above. The colors
are pretty much the usual Wheelie scheme, with light orange and a duller/darker
orange being the main colors, which both complement and contrast against
each other fairly well. The black window and tires help add a bit of dark
to the mode, and there's some silver on the grill on the front bumper and
on grill-like details about halfway back on the toy. The thing is, due
to the construction the front half or so of the main bulbous window is
painted silver-- which, given that it's on orange plastic, makes the gaps
in the toy even more obvious. It doesn't match at all with the black back
half of the window either, which is really an odd look.

    Wheelie's robot mode,
again, looks pretty darned good. For the most part it's pretty obvious
how he transforms just by looking at the two pictures, but there's a few
neat little unexpected bits, like the front wheel pieces fold behind his
lower legs and out of the way and how his windshield and back of the vehicle
compact together. The proportions are spot-on again, and the vehicle mode
extras are minimal-- the side doors are merely attached onto the back of
his lower arms which is a bit of a bummer, and due to the transformation
there's a "bump" of plastic with a pin through it behind Wheelie's head,
which almost looks like the top of an actual backpack. As with the vehicle
mode, the mold details are very minimal for the most part given the streamlined
futuristic look of the little guy, but on his robot-specific parts he does
have a few notable details, like Wheelie's trademark hat-with-an-extra-little-visor-bit
on top of his head, which is sculpted quite nicely. The hands and details
on the lower legs are also nice little touches, too. As for the color scheme,
there's the addition of a really pale blah gray which I don't like at all,
but to be fair it is accurate to his usual color scheme. I do like some
of the paint apps specific to this mode, such as the silver apps on his
lower legs, waist, and some really nice silver on his face with blue eyes.
Wheelie's very well-balanced, and has excellent articulation-- he can move
at the neck, shoulders, elbows, rotation at the waist, and movement at
the hips and knees-- most of the these are ball joints, which theoretically
should give him good posability. However, most of his ball joints are quite
loose, which obviously interferes with articulation but also makes his
vehicle mode stability even worse, and is another major bummer (though
granted, this can be fixed with some floor/nail polish).

    Titans Return Wheelie
is a nice design in both modes, with minimal extras and excellent proportions
in both modes. However, he really needed to go through another round of
QA, as his joints are mostly quite loose and the tabs that hold his vehicle
mode together aren't thick/wide/long enough-- combined, this makes for
a frustrating transformation to vehicle mode and gives the toy almost a
"KO" feel to it, hich is really unfortunate. Still, moderately recommended
if you have floor/nail polish.
