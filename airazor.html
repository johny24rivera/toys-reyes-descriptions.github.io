    Beast mode is a peregrine
falcon. This mode is okay, but her arms are clearly visible from under
her wings, and her underside looks awkward. Her wings can "flap" in and
out by moving the two yellow pieces protruding out of her back. This is
enhanced by flipping out claw pieces on her wings, to make it look like
she is grabbing something in front of her.

    Robot mode is a disappointment.
Her feet don't look like feet, but backwards hawk feet (which is what they
are). Her wings and her tail feathers stick out of her back, and, although
they don't get in the way, they may cause the toy to lose its balance.
She also has a neat little talon gun, but it's pretty easy to lose. There
is also a noticeable hole between her finely-detailed robot head and her
beast mode head, but this is a minor flaw.

    (There was a later version
of Airazor that was repainted and packaged with a Beast Wars video, but
I have been told the joints don't hold very well in this version.)

    Okay, but this is definitely
not the best basic transformer.

      An aerial reconnaissance expert, Airazor's
optical matrix scanners can detect Predacon ground movement from 30,000
feet. Internal radar transmitters then relay data to fellow Maximals, complete
with 3-D virtual reality maps detailing enemy location. Cyberblades located
within wings open for attack mode. And although the photon cannon concealed
beneath her tail is her weapon of choice in robot mode, she prefers attacking
Predacons with her armor slashing, titanium-plated talons!
