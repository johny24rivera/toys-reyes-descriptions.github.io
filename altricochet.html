    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Smokescreen.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Smokescreen

     Ricochet, a remold of
Alternator Smokescreen, is a straight repaint of
     <a href="altsilverstreak.html">
      Alternator
Silverstreak
     </a>
     , though unlike with
     <a href="altrollbar.html">
      Alternator
Rollbar
     </a>
     or
     <a href="altsunstreaker.html">
      Sunstreaker
     </a>
     , he has some
pretty nifty new paint apps added-- namely, the golden flame streaks on
the front hood and side doors-- in a similar manner to
     <a href="g1ricochet.html">
      G1

     </a>
     . They look pretty good, though I would have preferred
having the flames be a bit longer and skinnier to add a bit more to the
"fast" feeling that they're supposed to bring out. The white, black, and
gold color scheme, though the most original, does fit together very nicely
on this toy, and is rather eye-catching. I'm not sure why all of Ricochet's
robot face EXCEPT the nose was painted gold, though-- it looks a little
goofy, like he's been snorting cocaine or something. It's not too noticeable
is the light in the room isn't strong, but it still baffles me why it was
done, especially since the box pictures of him have him with a gold nose.
Ricochet, like his wavemate Rollbar, has a state license plate, this one
from New Jersey! Nice way to add a bit more realism, there.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Alternator Ricochet
is the best of the straight repaints in the line so far, with some nice
new golden flame paint apps. Overall, though, he doesn't quite beat out
the metallic-silver painted Alternator Silverstreak in terms of sheer attractiveness.
