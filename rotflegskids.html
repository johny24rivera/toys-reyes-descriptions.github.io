    Skids' Chevy Spark vehicle
mode is pretty well-represented at this small of a scale-- the proportions
are right-on, much more representative of the actual car than Mudflap's

    . Other than little "heel" bits on the back end, there aren't any
robot mode extras in this mode either, and he's got quite a lot of paint
apps to break up the green-- the headlights, bumper details, "skids" deco
on the sides, windows, and tail-lights are all painted and give him a fair
amount of a variety. His "skids" deco is a bit oddly stretched to have
it all fit on one plastic piece, though. There are a few unsightly "cracks"
in the vehicle mode, but it's not as bad in this mode as Skids' brother
Mudflap.

    Skids' transformation
is pretty much identical to Legends-class Mudflap's as well, but unfortunately
due to the different car proportions, it makes Skids' proportions in this
mode a bit wonkier. The legs are long, particularly for Skids, who is supposed
to have overly-short legs to begin with. He has one normal-sized arm, but
his right arm is ridiculously oversized. Granted, his right arm IS a bit
bigger than his left arm on the movie design, but a LITTLE. Not with a
fist four times the size of the other. Having small plastic bits stick
out in front of his shoulders doesn't look too hot, either. However, his
vehicle parts DO largely intergrate into his robot mode without looking
overly "kibbly", which is certainly a plus. His robot mold detailing is
pretty decent where it is done-- such as on his waist and legs-- but his
head detailig is off a bit. Can't quite put my finger on why, but it definitely
is-- he looks kinda owl-ish, actually. His head also doesn't click into
place anywhere, but kinda swings in place a little bit on the hinge that
attaches it to his chest. Regarding his color scheme, although it's still
fair, it loses a lot of the variety he had in vehicle mode, as much of
those paint apps are "hidden" in this mode. A bit more detailing on the
waist and/or arms would've been appreciated. Articulation-wise, Skids can
move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows, and hips. Not exactly stunning
articulation, even for a Legend.

    Skids is a bit weaker
of a toy than his Legends-class twin Mudflap. Skids definitely has a superior
alt mode, but his robot mode has some definite problems-- in terms of proportions,
sculpting, and articulation. He also has minor balance issues if you want
to do anything with his feet other than just keeping him standing straight
up. The other versions of Skids are better-- even if you want a simpler-transforming
version, I'd get the Fast Action Battler version over this one.
