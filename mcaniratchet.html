    Ratchet's vehicle mode
is decent for a Happy Meal toy, though it's not without some oddities.
Like many of his fellow Animated Happy Meal toys, Ratchet is REAL bereft
of paint apps in this mode-- his windshield is painted, but tha'ts it.
Which is a shame, as he's got quite a bit of mold detailing of a toy of
this size-- the doors are molded in, as is the "heartbeat" symbol on the
sides of the vehicle, the light bar, and the headlights. All just molded
in that dull off-white/dull gray, which is actually a few shades darker
than it should be compared to the show model. The robot head also just
is looking out from the back end of the vehicle-- just THERE, not even
with an attempt made at hiding it. Bleh. Also, there's a pretty darned
sizeable gap in the front of this mode. His proportions are pretty good
overall for a Happy Meal toy, though, and actually are bit more "realistic"
than his

    </a>
    , with harder
edges. Another bonus-- his wheels actually roll, instead of like on many
other Happy Meal toys where the "main" wheels are faux with little bitty
wheels on the underside providing the real rolling action.

    Ratchet's robot mode
has one huge glaring problem with it, right off the bat-- his arms. They're
so low on the figure they come out of his freaking STOMACH, and there's
no real design reason for this. Plus his arms-- merely molded on the side
of his vehicle mode panels, but hey, it's a Happy Meal toy-- are painted
a solid red wearing what it looks like gloves and are rather muscular.
It's very odd-- sort of like they belong on a different toy altogether,
like a superhero figure. He also suffers from the "uni-leg" syndrome the
other Animated Happy Meal toys suffer from, though at least the front part
of the vehicle mode serves as decent feet. (His upper legs could stand
to be a bit larger proportionally, though.) His head sculpt is quite well-done
and captures the character very well, however, and his chest design is
also decent given the circumstances. His paint detailing is also more prevalent
in this mode, on his arms, windows, and head, and really helps to break
up the color scheme a bit more.

Ratchet is about middle-of-the-road as far as this series of Happy Meal
toys goes-- and that's not a good thing. His vehicle mode is decent, if
very under-detailed and with a head sticking out the back. But his robot
mode, while not completely horrible (read: head and chest), has INCREDIBLY
odd arms and a big uni-leg made up of the entire front of his vehicle mode.
Just spring for the deluxe toy.
