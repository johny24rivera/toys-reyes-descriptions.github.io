    Thundercracker's vehicle
mode is a futuristic jet, meant to resemble the triangular jets seen in
the first episode of the original G1 TV series, before they went to Earth--
which is appropriate, since War Within is pre-G1. Anyways, this mode is
very slick, with a nice, sleek form and tons of paint detailing-- the silver
streaks especially enhance the look of this mode, and the "charred" paint
apps on the sides give the impression that Thundercracker's flown at pretty
darned high speeds. The yellow segmented windows look very nice against
the light blue, though the blue could have stood to be a few shades darker--
it's not bright or anything, but a darker color would have looked better
with the other colors, I think. The gray could also stand to be a few shades
lighter for some added contrast. The only real flaw with this mode structurally,
however, has to do with the fact that if you look at it from the rear,
the robot head and fists are pretty obvious. A small landing gear folds
out from the nosecone to help stabilize Thundercracker on a flat surface,
and there are two wheels on the underside of his rear section to help him
roll along.

    Thundercracker's robot
mode is very similar in its design to
    <a href="cysupstarscream.html">
     Cybertron
Starscream
    </a>
    , with large upper shoulders and lower legs, though they're
not so out of proportion as to look odd, of course-- it just makes Thundercracker
look more buff. The main changes to the Cybertron Starscream transformation
are that his tailfin splits in half and folds over his upper arms, and
that his nosecone folds behind his back. Neither of the changes look all
that great, to be honest-- the big point behind his back looks rather out-of-place,
and the tailfins halves over his arms make his upper arms look somewhat
hollow even though they aren't-- but they make the jet mode look much better
and sleeker because of these small changes, so overall it's a net positive
change to the basic design. I'm not all that enthused about Thundercracker's
head sculpt, however-- he has all these little details around his mouth,
like the sculptor wanted to add something there but couldn't figure out
what. And considering that Thundercracker has never had all those crowded
designs around his head, it was a rather odd sculpting choice. His head
is also gray instead of black like in every other form
    <a href="g1thundercracker.html">
     G1
Thundercracker
    </a>
    has had, and the new color choice doesn't look nearly
as good, in my opinion. Still, otherwise this is a great, well-proportioned
mode wiht some great articulation-- he can move at the head, shoulders,
elbows, wrists, hips (at two points), and knees (at two points), and given
that he's not back-heavy or anything, you can get quite a good few poses
out of him (though giving him a hand-held weapon would have made the poses
look a bit cooler, alas). His diecast parts are his lower legs, his main
body, his upper arms, and all of his nosecone piece except for the very
tip of it.

    War Within Thundercracker
is the best Titanium mold I've played with as of this writing (1/07), with
a superb jet mode and a pretty darned good robot mode, as well. He does
have a few minor color choices and design flaws, but they are nowhere near
major enough to ruin the toy, and if you don't like the colors, just wait
for the

      Thundercracker was so named because
of his unique sonic abilities. Even at low altitudes and speeds, he is
able to force super-compressed air pulses through his engine intakes, giving
him a burst of acceleration and generating a focused sonic boom that can
shatter reinforced glass and deafen unprotected audio receptors. He is
further able to modulate his sonic booms to affect the sensory response
processors of enemy targets, causing panic and fear.

      Recruited to the Decepticon cause by
Megatron himself and assigned to the elite Seeker squadron under Starscream,
Thundercracker proved himself to be a deadly and effective warrior, both
on Cybertron and Earth. Working alongside fellow Seeker Skywarp, he attacked
and destroyed the Autobot stronghold at Altihex, and nearly succeeded in
destroying Protihex as well.
