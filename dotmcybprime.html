    Optimus' first Cyberverse
release takes the familar truck mode and makes it larger than a legend
and smaller than a deluxe, with complexity appropriate for this new "in-between"
size. In vehicle mode, proportionally the drivers' section is a bit too
long and the back section a tad too short; otherwise, it looks pretty good,
particularly for this scale. You can just BARELY see the tips of his robot
hands from a rear or top view, but otherwise there's no robot extras in
this mode. The colors compared to the initial releases of other "Movie
Optimi" molds are a bit darker than normal, with the red in particular
not actually being all that much lighter than the dark blue. They still
go together fairly well, though, and the shade of gray plastic used for
this version is a really nice, almost metallic-looking shade of gunmetal
gray. Combined with the nice bluish shade of gunmetal on his windows and
various other "metal" parts like his smokestacks and front grille, this
is one of the better initial color schemes Movie Prime has had. That said,
he could've used a few more flame paint apps to be accurate to the movie,
or a few more paint apps on his back end. As an accessory, Prime comes
with a cool jetpack piece that clips nicely onto the back end of this mode,
complete with fold-up wings and two guns that sit on top of the jetpack.
For an accessory that's made almost entirely for his robot mode, it fits
in relatively well in this mode.

    Through a fairly simple
transformation, this version of Optimus gets across the general look of
his robot mode quite well, particularly the chest and head-- "mecha-abs"
and all. The mold detailing is particularly spectacular in this mode, even
for a movie toy-- there's so much detail on parts like his waist and chest
it'll make your eyeballs cross just trying to take it all in. The rear
section of Prime's vehicle mode folds up behind his back and stays out
of the way of articulation, but is still bulky and a little bit of an eyesore--
not to mention it doesn't lock in place anywhere, either. There's a few
other "vehicle bits", such as those on the back of his lower legs and arms,
but they're not a big deal and expected for the size. Proportionally, Prime's
limbs are also a little skinny, particularly his lower legs. His feet especially
need to be a little bigger-- they're so short that he can't stand up on
his own all that well. His articulation is pretty nice, though-- he can
move at the shoulders, elbows, hips, waist(!), and knees. As expected,
his jetpack can fold open and clip right on his upper back, while the two
guns can be slid easily and snugly into his open hands-- even if it makes
him a bit more unbalanced, they are some pretty awesome little weapons.

    Cyberverse DotM Optimus
is a pretty good representation of the character at this scale, with only
a few relatively minor proportional oddities (most notably his skinny feet
and overly long middle section in vehicle mode). For those who want a smaller--
but still fairly accurate-- version of Movie Optimus with a jetpack, this
is definitely the one to get.

      Though Optimus Prime has led the Autobots
for many years, he is only the latest in a long line of great leaders.
He looks to the history of his world for lessons on honor and duty, and
lives his life according to the ancient principles established by the leaders
of the past.

      *This toy was released both in the initial Commander wave of the normal
DotM toyline as well as in a special "Preview" release in the Spring of
2011, coming with 3-D glasses at a $10 U.S. price point. Both toy releases
are exactly the same, however.
