    Although he has a new-mold
toy for Dark of the Moon this time around, Barricade's vehicle mode is
still the same-- namely, a Mustang police car. He looks as cool and proportionally
accurate in this mode as he ever did, with the white bits on the doors
and the rear spoiler helping to add some contrast against all the black
plastic, while other little details-- such as the orange headlights, light
red taillights, purple Decepticon "badge" in front of the car doors and
transparent red-and-blue siren-- provide a few more bits of contrast elsewhere.
(And, of course, as is basically required of a Barricade toy that isn't
teeny tiny, he has his "To Punish and Enslave" motto near the back end
on each side as well.) That said, the windows bug me a little. The front
and car door windows are clear plastic-- which would be fine if you couldn't
see any parts inside besides a molded cockpit, but there's just robot parts
inside there, and the only extras visible in this mode to boot. It looks
a bit out of place, particularly when compared to the rear windows, which
are unpainted black plastic-- they definitely clash. As for Barricade's
Mechtech weapon, it's a rather thick (non-firing) machine gun that, when
you push back on the gray tab on the side, transforms into an almost ludicrously
large claw weapon, which actually suits Barricade just fine. I wish it
could stay in claw mode, but unfortunately due to the spring-loaded Mechtech
gimmick that's impossible. Barricade's only Mechtech port is in the middle
of his siren in this mode.

    In robot mode, Barricade's
almost an entirely different story depending upon whether you're talking
about him from the waist up or the waist down. From the waist down, he's
passable, but a little weak in places-- his legs proportionally look great,
but the back ends of the police car mode hang off the upper legs rather
unceremoniously and can get in the way of articulation a bit. His hips
also come out from the sides of his waist too much to the point where they
look a bit awkward, and the waist joint itself-- while I'm grateful that
Barricade has one-- is rather fat, so if you're looking at him from head-on
or a view that you can see underneath his chest, it looks a bit odd as
well. However, from the waist up Barricade is practically perfect, particularly
for the size-- his headsculpt and paint apps are spot-on; his arms are
skinny but not quite as 2-D as on his
    <a href="movbarricade.html">
     initial
movie toy
    </a>
    and thus more movie-accurate; the claw-hands are accurate
and not overly large; the car door panels slide outwards a bit so that
Barricade's arms don't appear to "break in half" when he bends his elbows;
and there's even a panel in the middle of his chest that flips around to
give him the more movie-accurate "crushed fender" look in this mode. The
mold detailing on his robot parts is also pretty spectacular overall, particularly
on his hands and arms, where all sorts of little hinges and the like can
be seen. When it comes to articulation, Barricade's pretty good in that
area, too-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows
(at two points), at the wrist, at the base of each hand (with all four
fingers on one joint), and at the waist, hips (at three points), knees
(at two points), and ankles. Thus, pretty much any point you can reasonably
expect on a deluxe-sized toy is here, and with a lack of back-heaviness,
only the couple of pieces behind his upper legs limit the number of poses
he can take.

    It took me a while to
decide which version of deluxe Barricade I liked better; this one or the
original movie mold. The first try was larger, had better robot legs, and
came with a little Frenzy partner. This version, however, has better articulation;
a slightly easier, but still satisfying, transformation; and better arms,
head, and chest in robot mode. I think the edge goes to this version due
primarily to the increased amount of articulation and poseability-- though
if you're looking for a "definitive" version of the character and money
isn't a factor, I'd still get the

      Barricade doesn't make friends, he finds
potential victims. His seemingly benevolent police car vehicle mode has
been known to trick potential targets into trusting him. Barricade has
the ability to stalk and eliminate nearly any Autobot he wishes. Humans
and Autobots alike should take cover when they notice police sirens in
the distance-- it could be the last thing they ever hear!
