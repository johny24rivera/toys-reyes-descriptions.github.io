    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime Beast
Hunters legion Smokescreen. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Prime Beast Hunters legion Smokescreen figure

     Prowl's color scheme
is very much in keeping with his traditional police car scheme of white
and black, with a little more white than usual-- his front hood has a rather
nice curved black pattern, and there's some black paint around his rear
wheels, but his sides in vehicle mode are mostly white. He also has black
plastic for his wheels and a few interior robot bits, but by and large
the rest of him is white-- particularly in robot mode, where such a large
portion of that mode being white makes him look a bit boring. In fact--
though it's certainly a fitting color scheme for a police car-- in general
the straight black/white color scheme I find a boring, and I'm glad they
"spiced it up" a bit in vehicle mode. The very dark metallic blue used
for his windows contrasts excellently with the white while also being visually
different from his black, and it matches rather closely with Prowl's weapon
color, as well. His sirens are also painted rather nice shades of metallic
red and blue, again giving him some much-needed color variation in vehicle
mode. There's also some black and white "Autobot with a star around it"
logos on Prowl's front hood and side doors, which makes him look a bit
more like a real police car, with little emblems and whatnot. There's also
a few other minor accent colors-- namely the silver on his face and the
dark metallic gunmetal gray for his headlights. In fact, for a Legion-class
figure it's rather impressive how many different color shades Prowl has;
I just wish some of them were used a bit more in robot mode. (His rear
bumper also desperately needs some paint, too.)

     Prowl does have one
mold change when compared to Smokescreen-- namely, the light bar in vehicle
mode that's a prerequisite for police cars. Unfortunately this light bar
"covers up" the Cyberverse weapon port on the top of the roof, so Prowl
can only store a Cyberverse weapon in vehicle mode on each side. Also,
although it's not a change to the "core" figure, Prowl comes with a hammer
weapon that's used with many Beast Hunters legion figures-- and is a darker-than-usual,
rather neat-looking shade of metallic grayish blue. I wish all the BH Cyberverse
weapons had been made in this color, in fact. (That said, I question how
well a "Justice Hammer" works for Prowl's character.)

Prowl's focus-- in terms of his paint scheme-- is clearly on the vehicle
mode, with a pretty decent number and range of paint apps making him a
pretty solid-looking police car with a nice range of accent colors. However,
this comes at the expense of many robot mode-specific paint apps, so he
can look too plain and overly white in that mode. I'd recommend him over
the original release of this mold as Smokescreen, but below the other uses
of this mold because of this.
