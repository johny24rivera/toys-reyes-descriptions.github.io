not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations IDW "Stealth

     The Detroit Lions have
a star player named Calvin Johnson, whose nickname is "Megatron"-- hence
this rather unique, exclusive release! Available exclusively via Nike retailers,
this special edition of Megatron oddly enough doesn't have the Detroit
Lions color scheme, but instead the typical Decepticon purple as a main
color, which goes along with the purple (expensive!) Nike shoe(s) that
he comes with, depending upon which size set you ordered. Or, you can find
some people selling it loose on eBay too if you don't want the expensive
shoes, which is how I got mine. Anyways, the main purple color on "Calvin
Johnson" Megatron is quite an eye-catching shade, being a relatively dark
purple but having a few glossy, milky bits to it that catch the light in
cool way. Unfortunately, Megatron's other main color here is a really boring
light milky gray (much more visible in his robot mode than in vehicle mode),
which I've never liked. It DOES contrast nicely with the purple, at least.
I much prefer Megatron's vehicle mode color scheme because of this. Beyond
a couple of nice silver and red paint apps on his intake vents, cockpit
windows, and the like, there's a really nice "grid" pattern on his wings,
which matches some of the shoes he comes with. There's also a red "Calvin
Johnson signature" paint app on the right side of his chest/vehicle front
(it's a paint app, not an actual signature-- though honestly, given the
price, I wish it had been). In robot mode, the unique paint apps are a
bit less obvious, but still there-- his feet have been decorated with the
same little red plus signs that are on some of the Calvin Johnson shoes,
along with a Nike symbol down there to make it look rather like he's wearing
the shoes! The same red plus-sign pattern is on the sides of his lower
arms, as well. I wish they had used a lighter red or a silver on these
tiny paint apps, though, because they're a bit hard to pick out, being
so tiny and fine-lined against the darker purple.

     No mold changes have
been made to the "core" Megatron figure, but he does come with a little
extra purple football accessory with a Decepticon symbol on it. In a rather
big downer, however, Megatron can't interact directly with the football
at all-- there's no peg for him to hold it in his hands, so you'll have
to settle for just placing it on the ground next to him or balancing it
carefully in one of his arms, I guess.

     "Calvin Johnson" Edition
Megatron is a nice nod to the Detroit Lions football star, and the color
scheme itself is pretty decent (except for the light gray) with some pretty
creative paint apps in both modes. However, given the VERY expensive price
of this toy if you buy it as part of an official package from Nike with
exclusive shoes, I wish a few extra things had been added to it, like oodles
of paint (such as silver paint in place of the light gray) and a better
accessory than a football he can't even interact with. If you're a big
Calvin Johnson fan AND a big Megatron fan, you might want to look into
this if you can find it for a decent price-- otherwise, this is an easy
skip, particularly considering that although this one still looks good,
you can find two better-looking releases of the mold for retail price.
