       Skywarp is back, and
this time in his most G1-ish form since, well... his
       <a href="g1skywarp.html">
        G1
toy
       </a>
       . Heck, actually it's MORE G1 than his G1 toy, since it looks more
like he did in the G1 cartoon. His delicious black, silver, and purple
color scheme is back again, and this time even better than it's been before.
Instead of a light purple, it's a more moderate color of purple this time
around, which fits in with the black and silver even better, in my opinion.
The silver looks great on his robot chest and intakes, and the nifty silver-and-purple
stripes on his wings really add to the sleekness of his jet mode. Another
nice touch is that the transparent orange-colored cockpit form the G1 toy
is kept for this toy as well. Oh, and his head is actually a BLACK color
this time with a painted silver face, instead of Classics Starscream's
bland gray face with painted black "helmet". It looks MUCH better.

       Classics Skywarp is
as good as this already awesome mold is going to get. The color is spot-on
perfect, with a lot of paint apps that complement each other really well.
Plus, it's always good to have another seeker!

           A mold as good as Classics
Voyager Prime needed a repaint, and it's here in the form of Ultra Magnus,
sans his

            G1 armor
           </a>
           . The colors are classic Magnus,
with white and blue being the predominant colors with a bit of black to
help darken things up a little. They worked well before, and they work
well now. There's also a fair amount of silver, which looks especially
good on the stripes on the front and sides of the vehicle mode and the
robot chest. The bronze detailing on the tire interiors looks really cool
as well, and probably contrast the best out of all the paint apps. That
said, Ultra Magnus does have a few flaws as far as his paint apps are concerned.
For one, the bits of yellow used for the headlights are so light they really
don't contrast much with the surrounding white at all, and are rather hard
to see because of this, especially on the robot waist. There are also a
few areas on Ultra Magnus that could really use some more paint apps, such
as the robot legs and shoulders.

          <font face="OCR A Extended">
           Classics Magnus has
some great color choices and is a fine repaint of Classics Optimus Prime.
However, overall I'd recommend Prime a little over Magnus just because
he has a bit more color variety and his paint apps are spread more evenly
over the figure.

             There's not really any
reason NOT to recommend the "Battle for Autobot City" 2-pack. You get two
of the best Classics molds, in great paint schemes, and for $10 cheaper
than if they had been sold seperately to boot. Given that at the time of
this writing they're on clearance, so they're even cheaper, if you're even
a casual fan of G1 this is a must-buy set.

Ultra Magnus commands the most powerful forces ever assembled, of which
he is among the greatest. He was given the honor of City Commander by Optimus
Prime because of his superior intelligence, and incredible might as a warrior.
Since taking command he has defended the city against dozens of attacks
by Decepticons led by the crafty Skywarp. For his part, Skywarp is determined
to breach the city's defenses and destroy Ultra Magnus in order to prove
