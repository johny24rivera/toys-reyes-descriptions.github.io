    Optimus Prime's alternate
mode isn't a truck, or even a "gift card-shaped" truck. It's basically
just his robot mode compressed so that none of the "robot-y" parts like
the head or fists show. Certainly not particularly impressive, but hey,
it only costs what amount you want to put on the gift card, it's essentially
free, so you can't expect too much. He's got a basic color scheme of dark
blue, red, and gray, though the colors actually contrast a little better
than on many of the mainline Primes-- go figure. The flame paint apps on
his legs and chest also look pretty darned cool, as well. (In case you're
wondering, there's a bar code on the back of the toy that is used on the
price scanner-- that's how he's a gift card.)

    Prime's robot mode,
obviously, is an "uncompressed" version of his alternate mode. This is
certainly a more substantial robot mode than Prime's rather odd-looking
alternate mode, though it is extremely limited in articulation-- he can
only move from side-to-side at the shoulders, wrists, and slightly at the
knees. So if you're expecting a free gift card to be a fully articulated
toy, sorry. He's also very, VERY two-dimensional, having almost no width
to his form whatsoerver. His arms, legs, chest, head-- they're all extremely
flat. Heck, his head doesn't actrually have any molded-in detailing on
it, it's just a tampoed paint app combination on blank plastic. At least
his proportions are fairly good from a front view, though.

    Gift Card Prime is a
really cool idea, being a transformable gift card and all. He's not very
impressive of a figure at all, but considering he's essentially free, one
can't be too picky. I mean, the fact that he's a gift card that TRANSFORMS
is sort of cooler than the actual toy itself. Not recommended if you have
to actually spend a substantial amount of money on him, but if you see
him at Target, by all means put a couple of bucks on him and get him, it's
a pretty cool idea.
