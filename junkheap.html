    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Wreck-Gar.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Wreck-Gar

     In keeping with the whole
Junkion color scheme so that he fits in with his mold-mate Wreck-Gar, Junkheap
here still keeps the same basic colors of gray and yellow/orange/red, just
in different amounts and in different places so that he still looks different
enough from his commander. Junkheap's main color is a dark red with a slight
tinge of fuchsia in it, and it contrasts extremely well against the dull
mustard yellow that's one of his secondary colors. Both are fairly unusual
shades of their respective colors to see, but it works quite well with
Junkheap, making him look more individualistic and eye-catching, though
the yellow bits on the weapon make it look even MORE like a pinwheel than
Wreck-Gar's. Unfortunately, he still has that really bland light milky
gray as a main color as well. As is usual with that shade of gray, it serves
as an okay neutral color and doesn't clash with anything, but it's an extremely
boring-looking shade. To add a bit more color variety, some light red has
been added to parts of the robot mode as well, and that both complements
and contrasts well against the dark red and was a nice accent choice. Junkheap
also forgoes Wreck-Gar's extensive paint apps on the chest in favor of
a bit more spread-out layout, with more parts getting paint apps, but no
one part looking particularly impressive by itself (though the silver-painted
feet and chest do look spiffy and "new").

     Junkheap has a new noggin--
it's one of a more generic Junkion type seen in the '80s animated movie.
It's impressively well-detailed, with the face a rather fleshy color that
contrasts well against the silver helmet, red square sunglass-like eyes,
and black "mustache". I do wish he didn't have clear plastic light piping
behind his head, though, as it looks odd partially shining thorugh the
painted-red eyes. Other than the head, Junkheap has no mold changes.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Junkheap is a nice "troop
builder" Junkion, and given the mold's gimmick to ride itself, is a fairly
recommended buy even if you already have purchased Autobot Alliance Wreck-Gar.
However, if you only want to buy one of them, I'd go with Wreck-Gar-- not
only is the latter easily the more iconic character of the two, but his
paint apps look a little better, in my opinion.

       Assembled and raised in the scrap pile,
Junkheap is a supremely resourceful bot. It was he who helped orchestrate
the repair and reboot of the disabled Ultra Magnus. The mighty Autobot
was so impressed with the talent of Junkheap that he encouraged Autobot
Ratchet to spend an extended leave on planet Junkion to hone his repair
skills.
