    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Minicon Reverb. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Cybertron Minicon Reverb

     Drivetrain here is a
bit of a polar-opposite color scheme compared to this mold's previous release
as Cybertron Reverb-- instead of a purplish blue, Drivetrain's a dull brick
red. With the black, it works quite well as a color scheme, and he's got
enough paint apps so that no area on him is too bereft of paint. The gold
headlights really go great against the dark red, and the silver works fairly
well, too. However, his head's painted rather oddly, with a silver face
and the rest of it painted black. Black eyes just don't work very well
on most TFs, this little guy included. Some other, more minor, downsides
to Drivetrain are the rather blah shade of milky gray plastic used for
his upper arms and legs in robot mode (though thankfully that's the only
places it's used), and his taillights are in need of some paint. Of note
is that though Drivetrain's packaging marks him as a Decepticon, he doesn't
have that allegiance symbol anywhere on him.

     Generations Drivetrain
isn't the hottest Minicon repaint out there, but it's a pretty decent,
nice color scheme that's noticeably different from Reverb's (and, in my
opinion, a tiny bit better). He's got a fair number of paint apps, too--
a bit of a rarity for many Minicons. Recommended if you're a Minicon collector.
