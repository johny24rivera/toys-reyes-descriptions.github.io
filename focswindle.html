    Swindle's alternate mode
for Fall of Cybertron is a four-wheeled vehicle that looks moderately hefty--
a decent "alien futuristic" take on his jeep/hummer alt mode he's traditionally
had. His mold detailing alternates between sparse to some pretty intricate
little bits like the cylinders near the front of this mode and the grill-like
panels near the back end. There are a few robot mode extras that make themselves
known in this mode, however-- the biggest offender is his back end, which
is mostly hollow and has the long robot "heels" sticking out fairly blatantly.
His lower arms are also fairly obvious between the two wheels on each side,
though the exhaust pipes at least cover up the fists. If you don't have
his small gun accessory plugged onto the top of his engine block, the back
of his robot head is also fairly conspicious, though by outline more than
anything else. As opposed to being in a game-accurate and G1-accurate tan
for his mass release version, Swindle gets a rather bright shade of yellow
here, with black being the main dark color to offset it. Some metallic
gunmetal gray and dull purple paint apps help to break up the yellow a
bit more, and the paint apps are barely adequate in this mode, and not
much more-- stuff like his wheel hubs (with all that awesome mold detailing),
exhaust pipes, and headlights are desperately needing some paint detail
to bring them out. His color scheme is actually meant to be a "light" homage
to
    <a href="blight.html">
     Energon Blight
    </a>
    , though a bit less slavish
of a color-homage than tje other mass-retail Combaticons are to their own
corresponding Bruticus Maximus components. I really wish they had toned
down the yellow just a tad, but otherwise the color scheme looks pretty
good as-is.

    One quick note about
the transformation-- when detaching Swindle's rear section from his front
in getting him to robot mode, be careful when you pull it apart at the
tabs. The tabs tend to hold together a bit TOO well, and several people
have reported the tabs snapping during this part of the transformation
if they were't careful.

    As for the robot mode,
Swindle's quite tall for a FoC deluxe-- in fact he's the tallest of all
his fellow Combaticons, though in fiction he's normally depicted as the
shortest! This is almost entirely due to his body mass actually being slightly
"front" heavy, with his chest angling down in front of his head a bit too
far. That-- above anything else-- is what makes this robot mode look a
bit awkward, though having very small upper legs compared to his lower
legs and having his shoulders a bit wide doesn't help either. I really
wish his shoulder pieces locked into place somewhere instead of just hanging
out around his upper body, as it makes that area of this mode look a bit
more haphazard than it otherwise would have. Another downside is that Swindle
has practically no back at all-- just enough plastic to connect his arms
to his torso and hide his main combiner port, really, so looking at him
from a back view you get the impression that he's distinctly skinnier and
how much of a false "shell" most of his bulk is. I do like the way the
exhaust ports rotate around on his lower arms, however, as well as the
piston cylinder-like details around his head, the way his grill piece pegs
securely into his stomach, and his headsculpt. Unfortunately, said headsculpt
could really use some paint on the face-- another weakness here, though
most of the paint apps from vehicle mode thankfully transfer over to this
mode as well because of his transformation. Swindle can hold his gun nice
and securely in either of his open hands. For articulation, Swindle can
move at the head (at two points, though one is solely for transformation,
so he can only look down, not up), as well as at the shoulders (at two
points), elbows, waist, hips (at two points), knees, and slightly at the
ankles. The awkwardness of his chestpiece and how small his upper legs
are can hinder articulation a bit more than it would seem from that list,
however, and there pretty much isn't any pose you can put Swindle in where
he doesn't look awkward.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    FoC Swindle has some
good points-- namely the overall look of his vehicle mode, arms, and robot
mode head-- but some awkward proportions in robot mode really hurt him,
particularly with how the chest/shoulder assembly is designed. I understand
some sacrifices have to be made considering he also turns into an arm or
a leg, but those robot mode proportions get on my nerves more than they
probably should. His color scheme is decent, but not great by any means
and he doesn't have enough paint apps-- thus, overall, this is the version
of the FoC Swindle mold I would recommend the least. Compared with his
other FoC Combaticons, Swindle's mold is pretty middle-of-the-road.

      To the other Combaticons, the war with
the Autobots is an epic clash for the fate of the universe. To Swindle,
it's a business opportunity. While his teammates relish the frenzy of destruction
they cause as Decepticon Bruticus, Swindle quietly calculates how much
he can get for selling all the scrap metal that'll be lying around afterward.
