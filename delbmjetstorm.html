    Vehicle mode is a fighter
jet. This mode looks VERY nice, with no extras whatsoever. The molding
is nice, as are the details; several wires, pumps, etc. There are several
nice features about this mode. For one, Jetstorm has little "landing gears"
that can be pulled out from below his jet cockpit and below his two missle
launchers. Secondly, the transparent red "missles" in his launchers create
a nice effect; the back ends of the missles look like "jet exhaust"! Very
neat! Third, the jet head has transparent "eyes" on it, that, when the
figure is held up to light, appear to glow. Finally, Jetstorm's jet head
can be pushed out into a movable position (shown above), just like on the
show! The only complaint I have about this mode is that the wings, in proportion
to the rest of his body, are entirely too small. True, this eliminates
them from getting in the way in robot and hover modes, but they make this
jet seem a little physically impossible. The spark orb is right in the
middle of Jetstorm, under the flap, you can't miss it.

    Sadly, the the robot
mode doesn't resemble the TV show version nearly as much as the vehicle
mode does- but that doesn't mean this isn't one great toy! The first thing
many people may complain about when they get this toy is the fact that
Jetstorm has big extras on his lower arms. Well, I think that this isn't
a downside- it makes the toy look a little more like the show version,
and it also carries the missle launchers, which is a neat upside. At least
it doesn't rest on the bot's shoulders or back in an immobile position,
like many other figures. Jetstorm, however, has very obvious extras next
to his head, which look odd, but they don't get in the way. Jetstorm's
head looks almost nothing like the TV show character, and looks like a
jet fighter pilot with large ears- it still, though, looks pretty neat.
Jetstorm, unlike his TV counterpart, has legs in this mode, which enable
him to stand. The only annoying problem with this mode, as well as the
hover mode, is that the missiles are a little touch-sensitive. Bump them
just a little, and they partially shoot out of their launchers. While this
is also true with the vehicle mode, you don't move his aft anywhere in
that mode much. :)

    Hover mode is little
more than just attaching Jetstorm's legs together and pulling out little
jet thrusters. While the look of the legs pushed together looks a little
odd, it gives its customers a variant to make it look a little more like
the show version.

    Highly recommended-
a very neat deluxe Vehicon.

      The appointed General of Megatron's
aero-drones, Jetstorm is the hotshot lord of the skies over the enslaved
planet of Cybertron. Quite a talker, tends to engage in tactics of verbal
intimidation. Headstrong attitude and less than modest personality often
cause friction with the other generals - but impressive combat abilities
speak for themselves. Outfitted with various types of energy blasters and
plasma bombs. Extremely swift and maneuverable in vehicle mode. Rather
flighty, Jetstorm never touches land - must convert into robot mode where
he hovers over the ground.
