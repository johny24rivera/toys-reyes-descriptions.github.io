    The first thing that
immediately will come to mind upon looking at Lord Doomitron's (LOVE that
name) alternate mode is that it looks like an extensive upgrade of the
    <a href="rid2battleprime.html">
     Mini-Con
Bludgeon
    </a>
    -- and that's basically what he is. Although Lord Doomitron
is mostly a new mold, he does share the same little purple lower legs and
lower arm parts from Bludgeon, and has the same color scheme, too-- with
even the same color breakup, with the rest of the mode beyond those lower
arms and legs being black, with some dull red on the eyes on the evil face
on the front of this mode. And as for this mode, it's... well, it's basically
a modified ball with a claw on the front. So it makes sense why it'd look
familar in that respect, as well. Just like Bludgeon, Lord Doomitron has
a face on the front of the alt mode, but this is a MUCH meaner face. The
narrowed angular eyes, the many sharp details, the fangs-- it looks rather
demonic to the point I'm honestly kind of surprised it was approved for
the more kid-friendly RID2015 line. There's three (relatively) long claws
coming out of the top, like an claw weapon with... well, a round mass underneath
like on Bludgeon, and the back end extends out further with a handle on
the end so that a larger toy can hold Lord Doomitron as a weapon. And admittedly,
it's a bit of a stretch of a weapon given how big the mass is-- if it was
a slimmer body things would'e looked better-- but it still looks pretty
cool. The handle can rotate up and down at the back end, so he can be held
in a few different positions. Just like with Bludgeon, there's some spike
details on the back end to give Doomitron a "medieval-esque" feel, though
there's some circuitry lines molded in there as well to remind you that
he is indeed a robot. Unfortunately, like most Mini-Cons, in this mode
there's basically no paint-- just the red eyes on the front, so many of
these intricate details aren't particularly obvious, being on black plastic.
(The teeth details in particular should have been painted.)

    Just like with Bludgeon,
you separate the alt mode by the back end into two halves and then rotate
those halves forward, which auto-transforms most of the rest of the figure;
all you have to do is then rotate down the tiny lower arm pieces and you're
done. (You can also rotate down the handle on the side of his right shoulder
if it's sticking out.) Most of the details from the alt mode carry over
here-- of course the aforementioned lower legs and arms from Bludgeon are
here, and because of the transformation and alt mode Lord Doomitron's got
a bulky physique with very wide shoulders and a chunky round chest, just
like Bludgeon. The evil face is now on his stomach, while the spikes are
on his shoulders, appropriately. The robot head moves back a bit, making
Lord Doomitron look like one meeeean dude, with an evil face encompassed
with what looks like a helmet with three long, curved antennae at the top
that of course become the claws in alt mode. He's even got tiny little
teeth molded into his no-nonsense face, and his face is painted a dark
purple with appropriately dark red eyes. Just like with Bludgeon, Lord
Doomitron can move his lower arms inwards a bit at the elbow, but beyond
that he's pretty much static in this mode. Lord Doomitron's armor pieces
are a light pale green, which contrasts pretty well against the black and
purple, and looks pretty good. That said, making them a bit more "ghostly"
in shade, like a Ghostbusters Slimer toy, would've worked even better given
his whole look, methinks. First, he's got two armor pieces that look like
fire that fit over his shoulders. He's got a large wedge-like piece that
fits on top of the claw piece-- obviously in robot mode it doesn't do much,
but in alt mode it makes it look more like a dagger than a claw, now. There's
a piece of armor that fits over his chest and mirrors the general look
but with even scarier teeth, making him look even MORE demonic, so... *shivers*...
there's that. Finally, there's two tiny little pieces that fit over his
lower arms, which have little dagger-like details pointing out of them
so that Lord Doomitron can shiv people with his chubby little arms.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Lord Doomitron's a pretty
nifty re-use of the Bludgeon design, modified to be a claw weapon. However,
the alt mode (without armor) is a bit weak, with the body being far too
large. The robot mode is definitely better-- even with those chubby little
arms, Lord Doomitron looks pretty fierce. Add on his fiery, pointy, demonic-looking
armor pits and he's probably the scariest RID2015 toy there is. The wedge
piece on top of his claws also makes his alt mode look better as well,
with the blade being fairly large. He's slightly above-average for a Mini-Con
overall-- though I wouldn't recommend him for little kids, the chest/armor
details might scare them a bit much.
