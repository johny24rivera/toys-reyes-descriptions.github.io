    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Minicon Jolt. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Cybertron Minicon Jolt

     Swashplate here has some
fairly basic colors-- black, yellow, and gray make up his main scheme.
The gray is kinda bleh, and unfortunatley it makes up a near-majority of
the plastic and is definitely the most prevalent of all the colors on Swashplate.
The main body is a bit of a chalky "cheese" yellow, and goes decently enough
with the gray, but not enormously well-- though it certainly serves the
"rescue helicopter" mode well. The parts that are really eye-catching about
this color scheme are the darker colors. The black legs-- with the nice
little copper headlight paint on the knees-- contrast quite well with the
other colors, but particularly the yellow. The transparent dark blue used
for the cockpit is also a really nice, deep color that provides some great
contrast against the yellow. Swashplate's robot face is also painted silver,
allowing one to pick it out fairly easily even through that dark blue plastic.
One last note is that though Swashplate's packaging has him listed as an
Autobot, his toy only has a Minicon symbol on it-- no Autobot allegiance
symbol at all.

     I'm not fond of all
the gray on Swashplate-- which is sooo overused by now-- but the yellow,
black, and dark transparent blue on it go together fairly nicely (particularly
for a rescue chopper), and the copper and silver headlights are neat little
touches. I wish he had at least a little bit of a unique paint mask, like
flames or a rescue helicopter identification number of something on his
main body, but such is life. Recommended slightly ove the original Cybertron
Jolt, but I think the
     <a href="shadowrecon.html">

     of
that character tops out Swashplate here.
