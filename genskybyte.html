    I find it interesting
that one of the most stand-out characters from the 2001 "Robots in Disguise"
line was a redeco of a Beast Wars toy that never appeared on the series'
own show. Poor
    <a href="cybersharktm2.html">
     Cybershark

    ... Anyways,
Sky-Byte's cyborg-ish, flying shark mode is fairly accurate to the
    <a href="skybyte.html">
     original's
    </a>
    ,
both in terms of proportions and general detailing. The proportions for
this thing are just pretty much spot-on perfect; his tailfin and main fin
are a tad small proportionally, but that's it. There's no obvious robot
kibble in this mode either, giving Sky Byte a more streamlined look than
on his original toy. If you look on the underside you can see a bit of
his robot feet, but they don't stick out at all. Sky-Byte's color scheme
is kept somewhat accurate, being mostly silver/gray, dark blue, and an
orangish yellow (the latter more visible in robot mode). The yellow and
bronze paint contrasts quite nicely with the dark blue, but I wish his
blah milky gray plastic had been replaced with something a bit more metallic
and/or darker in shade. It doesn't need to be chromed like on the original
Sky-Byte, but it all makes him look far more boring than the original because
of all this blah gray. The light blue on his face is a bit of an odd departure
from Sky-Byte's traditional color scheme, and I'm not sure I like it just
being there-- it complements the dark blue okay enough, but it needs to
either be used in more areas or eliminated from the equation. I do love
the metallic red eyes, though, both molded to look fairly accurate to the
more robotic eye on the original toy. The mold detailing isn't quite as
extremely busy as the original toy's, but he's still got oodles of details,
like tubes, coils, vents and the like along the "ripped open" areas of
his sides, along with plenty of other little wires and electrode details
along the rest of his main body. His rear section has more typical mold
detailing, with a more definitively armor-like look to it without a bunch
of little bits of detailing. His shark face also looks suitably out there,
with exposed tooth roots even, which I find a nice detail. Sky-Byte also
has a fair amount of paint detailing, but just like with his general color
scheme, it doesn't hold a candle to the insane amount of paint apps his
original release had-- but that's an unfairly high ladder for a toy released
in 2014. He's still got plenty of paint, from silver on his sides to a
silver fade around his fins to a light blue head to even having his individual
teeth and roots painted on his upper lip. That said, the way some details
are painted while some equally important details aren't is weird; for example,
the bits of exposed metal on the main body of this mode on his larger side
pieces are painted silver, whereas the exposed metal near the back of the
main body is left a milky gray. Also, Sky-Byte's top teeth are all painted
nice and pretty, but his bottom teeth aren't painted at all. For articulation
in this mode, Sky-Byte can move at the jaw, where each fin meets the main
body, at one point near the rear of his main body, rotation at the top
of his tail, and movement where his two larger rear fins attach to his
tail. It's pretty decent for a shark mode, but I don't like the eternally
curved positon Sky-Byte was molded in; I wish he was a bit straighter,
as when laid on surface without some kind of stand to plug into a hole
on his underside, he's facing towards the floor too much, which I'm not
fond of. As for Sky-Byte's gimmick, by pressing on a dark gray trigger
near the rear, you can cause his tail to twirl around, in a manner similar
to many helicopter Transformers' rotor movement and the original Sky-Byte's
tail, in a way to make it look like the twirling tail is somehow keeping
him afloat. There's also another button on the lower tail itself that,
when pressed, will fire a spring-loaded projectile from the back end, molded
to look like wind even if the color of it is yellow.

    Sky-Byte's transformation
is a bit simpler than the original's, though the original's was DARNED
fiddly and a bit annoyingly complex. Here it can still be a bit tricky
to get everything lined up when geting him back into beast mode, but by
and large his transformation isn't that bad. Sky-Byte's robot mode-- while
hitting a lot of the main design notes of the original-- varies a bit more
in its look this time from the source material, with most of these changes
being negative. For one, I don't like how the shark chest comes at his
main body at a rather odd angle, thrusting forward a bit too much, though
having the nose turn around to reveal a detail resembling the original's
Predacon "spark crystal" in the chest was a nice little touch. This odd
shark-chest makes his waist look very insubstantial as well, and he's a
bit too hunchbacked, with there being a definite gap in between his shoulders,
which are a bit further back than his head. The legs are also very anemic,
with the lower legs being just the halves of his shark mode gill pieces
and little more-- these parts are this toy's biggest weakness, if you ask
me. His right arm is also a bit weak, as the panels that fold together
to form his lower arm are a bit too large compared with his upper arm,
and his hand doesn't look quite "right" coming out of those large hollow
plastic pieces. Sky-Byte's right arm is better, being roughly proportional
with his standard four-pronged tail-claw weapon, though the tail itself
is a bit smaller and doesn't look as impressive as on the original. On
the plus side, the shark side panels on his shoulders fold together a bit
better than on the original and don't get in the way nearly as much, and
the main shark flippers stay out of the way as well, and there's no annoying
panels behind his arms this time. The mold detailing on the robot parts
is very accurate to his original toy and generally done quite well-- especially
the head, which looks like it was basically lifted right out of the TV
show. For articulation, Sky-Byte can move at the neck, shoulders (at three
points, with one of these points being small additional "fin" pieces that
slide out of the sides of said shoulders), and at the elbows (at two points),
the aforementioned rotation and fin-claw articulation from his beast mode
on his lower right hand, at the wrist and thumb on his right arm (all of
the fingers except the thumb are one piece), and at the hips (at three
points), knees, and ankles. His feet are fairly large and flat so he's
stable, but I really wish his legs could pull off a bit more posabliity--
though then again, given how horrible they look from so many angles, perhaps
it IS better this way.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Generations Sky-Byte
has
some rather inventive "twists" to his design that allow for a more streamlined
beast mode and less kibble in the robot mode, but his robot mode suffers
from several bad proportional maladies and is by far inferior to the original's.
This, added with the more boring color scheme and considerably less paint
than the original (even if the original set a ridiculously high bar in
this respect), make this a purchase only for fans who can't secure the
original Sky-Byte for a decent price and still want him or where a simpler
transformation is more important than a good-looking robot mode.
