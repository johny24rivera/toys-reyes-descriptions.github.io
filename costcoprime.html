          This version of Prime
is very... um... yellow. Still, it's certainly an above-average effort
for a discount store exclusive, when compared to some of the other recent
ones... For one thing, a few of the paint apps are different, such as the
now striped patterns on the front hood of the car and the black-and-yellow
stripes near the back of the trailer. The other paint apps are the same
as they were on Powerlinx Armada Prime, albeit in different colors. The
only main plastic color that is kept the same from Powerlinx Prime are
the light gray parts, and such a major color change is certainly appreciated
for a discount set. The black, red, white, gray, and silver all go together
very nicely, and give Prime a bit of a darker feel to him. However, what
DOESN'T go together with the other colors is-- you guessed it-- that ugly,
noxious yellow. Egads, it's like the design team had all the other colors
worked out perfectly, but then it was lunch time so they just slapped any
old color on the remaining pieces. It's an ugly color that shouldn't be
used on any Transformer, much less one that's supposed to be going for
a darker feel. Even that transparent yellow plastic looks awfully gaudy...
ick. What were they thinking?

            Rollout, just like Optimus
Prime here, is now really really yellow. At least it's not quite as noxious
of a color that was on Prime, but I can still think of about a hundred
other colors that would have worked better. Still, the blue, black, and
maroon go reasonably well with the yellow, and Rollout seems to have roughly
the same amount of paint apps as his previous versions. So it's not too
bad, especially given that the set's got such a huge discount.

              CostCo Overload-- or,
as I like to call him, Magic School Bus Overload-- has pretty much the
same color scheme as CostCo Rollout, so my comments on Rollout's scheme
apply here as well. There are some large areas of Overload's vehicle mode,
however, that don't have any paint apps at all, and having that much yellow
without any other colors interrupting it... ain't too easy on the eyes,
in my opinion. And unlike Prime, he doesn't have any "new" paint apps,
just the same ones as Armada Overload, but different colors. All the different
colors really come together in robot mode, though, helping to break up
all that yellow. It's still, I think, the worst of the color schemes that
this mold has had, but I wouldn't call it downright horrible-- just very
mediocre.

              No mold changes have
been made to CostCo Overload, so he can combine with his packmate Prime
and all that, just like the Armada version could.

               The CostCo repaints of
Prime and Overload are definitely a bit gaudy and bright, and are, I think,
the worst color schemes these toys have gotten so far, even if their color
schemes have been changed completely, which is a little uncommon these
days for discount exclusive toy sets. And having a few new paint apps on
Prime ain't too bad, either. But still, if you've noticed, you may be asking
yourself why I've given these gaudy repaints higher ratings than any of
their previous versions. The answer, my friends, is in the price! You pay
only $30 for $60 worth of toys-- it's a GREAT deal. So I'd mildly recommend
the set if you don't have Armada Prime and Overload, but wanted to get
them-- but if you already have any previous versions of these molds, you
might just wanna stick with the ones you've got.
