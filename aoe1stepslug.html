    Slug's alternate mode
is still a triceratops on spiky metal steroids for his 1-step changer version,
with the size of his spikes that aren't on his face having been minimized,
particularly the ones on his tail. Now he looks more "armored up" and rocky
in his detailing than spiky. The proportions for this mode are
    <i>
     generally
    </i>
    okay (small tail not included), but it looks like he's hunched over a bit
unnaturally-- like he's "crunched up" a little, ready to pounce. This is
all due to his transformation, which we'll get to shortly. Slug also has
some robot extras in this mode-- specifically in the form of a rather obvious
back of his robot head behind his triceratops crest, and obvious feet on
the top of his rear triceratops legs. On a lesser note, you can also see
his upper robot legs underneath the stomach in between his two legs, but
this part is painted black and mostly goes along with Slug's general silhouette,
only dipping a bit below where his stomach would normally end. As such,
this latter extra doesn't bug me that much. As far as his color scheme
goes, this version of Slug mostly keeps in line with his other AoE toys,
but the bluish-purple from the other toys is outright dark purple on this
toy, with not much of a hint of any blue in it. Still, it looks good against
the silver paint on the back, the horns, and the shoulders, as well as
the light red on the head crest. Despite Slug having nearly as much mold
detailiing as a mainline toy, though, some areas are lacking the decorative
paint that's on his other toys-- most notably the lack of any paint on
his face (or even his main horn) beyond his blue eyes. The crest is also
a solid red, instead of being a combination of both red and silver paint
apps. This makes Slug look a bit more plain than his other toys, his

    in particular. For articulation in this mode, he can move up-and-down
at the base of his tail, and his front legs can move forward-and-back at
the knees. It's not much-- and I really wish he had jaw articulation--
but that's not the point of this subline.

    To transform Slug to
his robot mode, simply open up his triceratops head by splitting the head
into its two halves and then swinging them outwards-- everything else automatically
folds into place, though you'll have to straighten up the arms a bit. What
immediately strikes me after seeing Slug in this mode is that he looks
a bit short-- his legs aren't quite as long as they should be and his arms
a little TOO long, and the relatively large triceratops head-halves on
his shoulders exaggerate this a bit. Still, on a rather stocky 'bot like
Slug, it works alright, and otherwise Slug is pretty accurate without a
bunch of extra kibble. (His hands are merely molded into the bottom of
his front dino feet, though.) Really, the only piece I would qualify as
"kibble" is the tail, which just hangs off his butt but can be folded partially
up so you can't notice it from a frontal angle. The sculpting on his robot
parts keeps the same general "armored" look from his beast mode, though
of course he has the pointy "knight boots" like the other AoE Dinobots
and a spot-on facesculpt that looks like a rounded knight mask, complete
with a single blue optic paint app. Slug's color scheme varies up slightly
in this mode, with a medium shade of gray becoming more apparent in the
middle of the chest and on the upper arms. It's not a color I'm particularly
fond of, but at least it's not that really boring light milky gray shade,
and it keeps Slug from looking "too purple". The black and red on the upper
legs also helps to break up the colors a bit more as well in a departure
from his normal AoE toy colors, though his legs-- particularly his knight
shoes-- could have used some paint. Still, overall his colors are broken
up pretty well. For articulation in this mode, Slug can move forward-and-back
at the shoulders, and side-to-side at the elbows (given his transformation,
it'd be pretty much impossible to include leg articulation). Again, it's
not great, but that's not what the one-step changers are about. He badly
needs some sort of weapon, though.

    Slug isn't a bad 1-step
changer by any means, having only a few issues like looking a little short
in robot mode, like he's eternally looking down a bit too far in beast
mode, and (as usual) a lack of articulation. That said, there's really
no point to this toy. If you want a simpler-to-transform AoE Slug toy,
the
    <a href="aoepbslug.html">
     Power Battler
    </a>
    also has a very simple transformation
but also has weapons, slightly better articulation, and slightly better
proportions as well, so I'd recommend this the least out of the AoE Slug
toys.
