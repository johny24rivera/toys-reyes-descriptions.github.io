not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to legends Combiner Wars Groove.

     Wreck-Gar is a motorcycle.
Groove is a motorcycle. Ergo, Groove has been remolded into a Combiner
Wars version of Wreck-Gar-- at least that's the logic. And color-wise Hasbro
did an excellent job. The light orange and light orangish yellow is a great
basic color scheme, with the light orange being a GREAT shade of the color,
and both of them complementing each other quite well. There's also a fair
amount of black-- on the wheels, obviously, but also on the motorcycle
seat and as the base plastic for the windshield and a few other minor parts.
Red is another fairly prevalent color, used as paint on the center areas
of the wheel hubs as well as on the robot shoulders, and on some rather
neat yellow/red decals on the robot knees that replicate some similar details
on the original G1 figure. For accent colors, there's some silver on the
headlights and face, and there's some really nice blue paint on the windshield.
The blue is an excellent contrast color against what is otherwise a very
"warm" color scheme, and I honestly wish there was just a bit more of it,
as a bit TOO much of Wreck-Gar is in the orange area of the color wheel,
in my opinion. Still, it all looks good. The problem is, what with the
very lean physique, the more "squat" motorcycle-- the mold just does not
say "Wreck-Gar" at all. It's too much of a "color-slap" done just because
Wreck-Gar is a fairly well-known TF motorcycle rather than because the
design fits him.

     Thankfully, Wreck-Gar
at least has a new headsculpt, which is fairly well-done for the size,
with a bit of faux little "motorcycle front" details on his forehead, along
with a black painted beard and little beady red dots for eyes on a silver
face. His packaging says he combines with
     <a href="cwskylynx.html">
      Sky
Reign
     </a>
     , but he does no such thing-- there's been a few halfway "fan"
modes, but Sky Lynx's torso mode has no space for Wreck-Gar's chest armor
mode.

     Combiner Wars Wreck-Gar
has a great color scheme, and by itself it's my favorite color scheme this
mold has been in. That said, it fits the character very poorly outside
of general alt-mode and the new headsculpt, and for Wreck-Gar fans I'd
recommend the
     <a href="aawreckgar.html">
      Autobot Alliance
     </a>
     or upcoming
Power of the Primes versions instead, depending upon whether you want him
to combine or not. I'd only recommend this version for completists.
