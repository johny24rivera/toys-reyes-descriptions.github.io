    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Mirage. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Mirage

     Given that the original
Machine Wars Mirage toy was one of the few toys in the line that actually
LOOKED like its G1 version, it only makes sense that FunPub would redeco
the excellent Classics Mirage mold in his Machine Wars color scheme. Like
with most of their Machine Wars "updates", though, FunPub enhanced the
color scheme a bit for this version and added in more details. The original
had a rather dark shade of teal, whereas this version has an absolutely
WONDERFUL shade of seafoam green that seems like it would fit right in
on some Seacons. It contrasts and complements all the white on him exceptionally
well, and given the large white stripe down the center of the vehicle mode,
there's plenty of interaction between the two colors-- and this is in addition
to minor connector parts in his robot mode also being white, like his waist,
middle arms, and part of the chest. There's also a bit of black-- not only
on the expected wheels, but on a bit of his robot knees, part of his robot
shoulders and chest, and part of his (otherwise transparent) cockpit window,
to give Mirage at least a bit of dark coloration on him. (That said, the
downside of having a completely clear cockpit window is that the robot
head inside is REALLY easy to see in vehicle mode.) The head itself is
nicely done, being mostly painted white but with a bit of seafoam green
detailing on the forehead vents. There's also a bit of bronze on Mirage's
wheel hubs, and a bit of red here and there-- such as along the sides of
his robot chest, the top of his robot lower arms, and on some of his insignias--
including the bronze "7s" encircled by the color and a black outline both
on the front and on the sides of his vehicle mode, in a nod to his original
MW toy. Also in a nod to original MW toy are some of his fake sponsor decals,
like the style of his "lamb shocks" decal on the left side and "MOBILE
PISTONS" on the right. In place of the rather plain "MIRAGE" logo on his
original MW toy, this one has the more inventive "Illusions Motorsports"
on the spoiler, in a rather nifty font, too.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Mirage.

     Even if he's not particularly
inventive-- he IS just Mirage as Mirage in a new color scheme, after all--
Botcon 2013 Mirage is my favorite convention exclusive in terms of the
actual rating (when you combine both the mold and color scheme and leave
out any attachment to the character and inspiration). The seafoam green,
white, and black color scheme is just GREAT, and all the little red, bronze,
and the like details on him are just icing on the cake that is this color
scheme and still one of the best Transformers molds ever. Highly recommended--
especially since this set was in pretty low demand, so it's not uncommon
to actually find him at about what you would have paid for the mold if
it had been released at mass retail!

       Although he has adapted his skills to
war, Mirage has never truly been a soldier. Formerly an aristocrat living
a luxurious lifestyle, he fights only because he has been forced to do
so. After the defeat of Unicron and the start of the new Golden Age, Mirage
returned to his home planet in hopes of once again finding peace.

       However, he soon found that his beloved
Cybertron faced a new threat-- the Machine Wars. He teamed with the Earth-born
Autobot Electrons to provide upgrades to the world's population, preparing
them for the upcoming battle. He even opted to take a few of the upgrades
for himself, increasing his speed by a factor of 2. He also has exposed
himself to the highly contentious forestonite, which has enhanced the range
of his invisibility field tremendously.
