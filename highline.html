    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Speed Dial 800. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Speed Dial 800

     Highline's overall color
scheme seems to be sort of a "mirror image" of
     <a href="wiretap.html">
      Wiretap's
     </a>
     .
Switch Wiretap's red and black bits and you essentially have Highline's
color scheme. Granted, red and black (or charcoal gray, rather) may not
be the most original color scheme for an Autobot, but that doesn't mean
it looks bad. Red is certainly an appropriate color for a cell phone as
well as for a "good guy", and it's not a particularly light shade of red
which has the possibility to look garish. The charcoal gray works as a
nice contrasting color (though straight black might've worked better),
but the silver is what really makes a good secondary color. Using it on
some of the buttons plus the "cover panel" of the cell phone really looks
great against the red. As far as the stickers used for Highline's "viewscreens",
they're fairly realistic and show off all the things you'd expect from
the main menu of a cell phone, like the battery power left, menu options,
an inbox icon, the time, etc. Oh, and apparently "TF4EVER" is Highline's
network name, and according to his cover panel he has 1 missed call, heh.

     Highline 1070 is a fairly
good-looking repaint of a medicore mold, though it was rather unneeded
seeing as how this mold has already been repainted once before in the same
line and it looks much better as Wiretap, in my opinion. I think he does
look better than the mold's original colors used for Speed Dial, though.

       Highline 1070 knows where you're at.
Any creature he establishes a connection with, either physically, or through
his communications system is saved in his extensive target list. Those
that get labeled as Decepticons, he tracks continually, waiting for them
to be in a perfect spot for an ambush. Then, he lays traps designed specifically
for each enemy, and moves in to finish them off.
