    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Megatron.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Legends

     Warpath-- as you'd expect--
is a recolor whose color scheme fits pretty in-line with his G1 colors,
albeit a bit closer to his more recent
     <a href="genwarpath.html">

     </a>
     figure, what with a fairly dark brick red and milky gray being
the main colors. It's a pretty basic color scheme, but it gets the job
done, and certainly fits a tank. I do wish his milky gray plastic was a
bit more metallic-shaded, but in the amounts it's used it's not bad. What
looks particularly nice are the metallic gunmetal gray paint apps used
for Warpath's treads, feet, and a (very) small portion of his face, in
between his eyes; it's a really nice shade of the color, and looks particularly
fitting and realistic for the treads. The bit of gold on Warpath's abdomen
in robot mode looks quite good and brings some much-needed brighter color
to the toy; I wish it had been used more on the toy. The Autobot symbol
also stands out against the red-and-black chest. The same can be generally
said for Warpath's Autobot-blue eyes, though they're so small I can't really
say they contribute to the color scheme. On the negative side, the paint
used for Warpath's lower arms/front of the tank mode turret is a rather
ugly shade of dark brownish red. It's theoretically supposed to be the
same shade as his brick red plastic, but it's actually noticeably darker
and of a slightly different shade, so it clashes a bit and in a rather
ugly way, too. Thankfully, this paint is just limited to said lower arms.
The gray fists are also REALLY obvious in tank mode, what with everything
else around them being dark red.

     Warpath has one mold
change compared to Megatron, and that's a new headsculpt. It's pretty faithful
to his G1 headsculpt, with a rather roundish headcrest, a faceplate with
some small notches in the sides, and a strip along the center where you
can see his blue eyes and gunmetal gray "metal" paint around said eyes.
Nothing's wrong or misshapen with it, so I have no problems with it.

     Combiner Wars Warpath
isn't a bad toy at all, but beyond it being a tank (and, of course, the
new colors) it doesn't fit the character all that well. Warpath's whole
thing has been having a big ol' cannon barrel in his chest, but this one
has his cannon barrel on his arm-- just like Megatron, which makes it way
too obvious who he's been remolded from. Megatron and Optimus Prime's designs
are so iconic by this point, they (almost) never should be used for other
characters, and Warpath is included in this general rule. Plus, just a
few years before he had a deluxe version released, and a few years before
THAT he had a (smaller)
     <a href="uni2warpath.html">
      Legends class version
     </a>
     released as well in Universe 2.0. As such, there's no need to get this
version unless you want a version that's exactly to G1-cartoon-scale with
the other "Minibots" released in 30th Anniversary/Combiner Wars/Titans
Return et al-- the previous versions of him fit his design better, even
if this one has the best tank mode overall.
