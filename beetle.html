    Beast mode is, obviously,
a beetle. This transformer has no name, and is just referred to as "Beetle".
While there are almost no moveable parts in this mode, it looks surprisingly
nice from above, especially for a Happy Meal toy.

    Robot mode looks very
similar to that of
    <a href="insecticon.html">
     Insecticon's
    </a>
    . Beetle's
beast mode head becomes his chest, his insect legs hang off of his arms,
and would get in the way if there were any elbow articulation in this toy.
His face looks very serious, like
    <a href="megatrex.html">
     Megatron
    </a>
    's.
His legs look sort of like a mutant beetle's legs, and are a nice touch.

    This is actually, in
my opinion, one of the few Happy Meal toys that's not that bad. The major
downsides are the lack of articulation and the small size. A nice starter
toy for little 'uns, though.
