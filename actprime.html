    Optimus Prime's truck
mode, is, quite simply, a mess. Only the front really looks like a truck--
the rest just looks like his robot mode folded backwards (which is what
it is, of course). The feet stick out very blatantly from the back end,
the hands don't connect to the front end very well and also stick out,
and the midsection consists of a bunch of plastic bits just folded over
each other, but with no solidarity to make it look like it's a solid vehicle
mode under there. You can also fairly easily see his upper robot legs and
the sides of his arms in all that mess of jumbled parts. On the plus side,
Optimus Prime's color scheme is pretty show-accurate, as is his paint job,
so no problems there. And at least with the wheels folded out on his sides
he can roll pretty well. Pressing down on the gray tab a bit behind his
sirens will transform him most of the way to robot mode, but there's an
usually large number of minor steps involved afterwards for an Activator--
you have to straighten out his arms, fold out his hands, fold down his
feet, seperate his legs, and then fold the wheels around his legs before
he's fully transformed. Again, not a huge deal, but given the whole "spring-loaded
transformation" gimmick of the Activators, it seems a bit much.

    Like nearly all Animated
Prime toys, the robot mode is what really shines on this Activator. The
proportions are nearly perfect, which is particularly impressive for a
spring-activated toy that's this small. His chest is slightly bigger than
it is in the cartoon, and the wheels on the sides of his legs are a bit
beefier due to the size of the toy, but that's about it. The mold and paint
detailing is also very well-done where it's needed, such as the chest,
feet, and particuarly the face, which has some crisp detailing and lots
of different colors of paint all on a pretty small area. Like most of his
toys, Optimus Prime's face is molded with his faceplate up on this Activator.
The bits of yellow in particular really contrast well against the blue,
silver, and red. As for articulation, Prime's got that in spades too, for
an Activator-- he can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows (at two points),
hips, and knees, and most of those are on ball joints, so you can get quite
a few poses out of him to boot.

    Activator Optimus Prime's
robot mode is great for a toy of such size, but his vehicle mode truly
is pathetic-- it's just a truck front and wheels with a bunch of obvious
robot parts and folded up in a haphazard manner. Unless you're a Prime
completist, do yourself a favor, save up a few extra bucks, and pick up
one of the deluxe versions of Animated Optimus Prime instead.

      Young and inexperienced, but also utterly
fearless, Optimus Prime commands his squad of loyal Autobots with strength
and wisdom. For its own reasons, the AllSpark chose him to protect it,
and he has sworn to do so with all his might. He is a natural leader and
a powerful fighter for peace. Where he goes, his Autobots willingly follow.
