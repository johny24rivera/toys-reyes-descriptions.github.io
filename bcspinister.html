not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Tomahawk.

     "Classics" Spinister
here replicates his G1 version's color scheme almost to a tee-- for better
or worse, depending upon how much you like some of the louder color schemes
of the late '80s and early '90s Transformers. A rather nice shade of greenish
shade serves as his main color (particularly in helicopter mode), with
black and hot pink serving as the main dark and light contrast colors for
it, respectively. Yeah, I know-- hot pink. In robot mode, it looks particularly
like he has hot pink shorts. For me, there's just enough of it where it
doesn't bother me-- any more and it would've been a bit TOO loud of a color
scheme. This is helped by Spinister's several other colors that are all
used in moderate amounts-- purple, light milky gray, and a nice shade of
seafoam green on his missiles and feet. Other than the boring light milky
gray (which is only on his tail and propellers), every color contrasts
well with every other, though, so there's no issues there. Spinister also
has a lot of paint apps, even for a Botcon toy-- from the arrows on his
wings to the pink stripe down his vehicle mode to the purple and black
paint apps on his wings and legs, if he had a few more paint apps I might've
even considering him a bit too busy! Colors aside, however, this doesn't
really work very well as an update of G1 Spinister. The helicopter is a
bit of a different model and the robot mode proportions and chest look
COMPLETELY different from the original-- too much of a "movie-ish" aesthetic
to serve as a believable update to a G1-universe character, really. The
only real common design bits both versions of Spinister have are the general
shape of the helicopter blades (which also go behind his back in both robot
modes) and where his arms go in helicopter mode.

     Spinister has a "new"
headsculpt, though it's one that was made with the rest of the mold-- it's
just one that Hasbro never got to use on one of their own releases. The
mouthplate fits Spinister, but the rest really doesn't at all-- that said,
it's well-sculpted and certainly unique-looking.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     This toy has a pretty
good color scheme (hot pink and light milky gray side), with an almost
riduclous number of paint apps that keep "Classics" Spinister from looking
anything but boring. That said, as an update to Spinister himself, it doesn't
work that well. If you're going to get it, I'd get it because you like
the mold and/or the colors, not for the character it's supposed to represent.

       Spinister is a complete and utter mystery
to everyone, and that's just the way he likes it. No one knows just why
he sided with the Decepticons, but they've been reaping the rewards ever
since. When asked about his background he remains silent or threatens to
destroy anyone who continues to probe him. He enjoys toying with Autobots,
softening them up before going in for the final kill. Spinister recently
surfaced again, showing up on Earth with Octopunch and Stranglehold, after
having gone missing for twenty years. As always, he doesn't discuss where
he has been. Nor has he offered any clues as to his recent body upgrade.
Spinister uses a unique cloaking system in his alt mode, which enables
him to sneak up on Autobots while avoiding detection. He refuses to share
the technology with his colleagues in case they decide to use it against
him.
