      Appearances can be decieving--
this "Powerlinx" version of Optimus Prime is actually a different mold
than his $40 version. The differences? Well, the major ones are that he
doesn't come with a trailer or drones. However, in place of this, he can
Powerlinx with other deluxe Energon Autobots, which is a definite plus.
His "normal" robot and vehicle modes are pretty accurate when compared
with the $40 toy. Which is unforunate-- it's really quite an ugly toy in
its individual modes. So all of my comments on the individual modes of
$40 Energon Prime, which you can see in his toy review
      <a href="enprime.html">
       here
      </a>
      ,
apply to this toy as well. A few minor differences-- he has a chrome truck
grill, which I prefer over the plain silver of the original one. Those
chrome teal headlights look especially cool. Also, his truck windows are
transparent plastic, instead of just painted a silverish blue. It looks
a little better, but it's not like you can see anything inside or anything.
Not all of the changes are for the better, sadly-- his robot head is now
VERY clearly visible in his already hideous vehicle mode. It's just looking
up from inside his Powerlinx helmet... just staring at you. There's not
even an attempt to hide it. The vehicle mode also doesn't seem quite as
solid-looking as the $40 toy-- there's some noticeable gaps in the structure
on the bottom half when look at from a side angle. As for articulation,
Prime's pretty much the same as his Energon version, with the sole exception
of his hips, which can now rotate out to the sides instead of just back
and forth.

       As the top half of a
Powerlinx robot, Prime looks surprisingly good-- his shoulders are big,
yes, but they're symmetrical, and incorporate his various robot parts into
a rather pleasing design. He also has machine guns for hands now, and you
can't beat that. As a matter of fact, I think this is probably the 2nd
best top half of a Powerlinx robot in Energon, second only to
       <a href="enprowl.html">
        Prowl
       </a>
       .
I'm surprised they managed to incorporate this good of a Powerlinx mode
into a toy that resembles the $40 Energon Prime toy almost exactly.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       As the bottom half of
a Powerlinx robot, however, Prime just looks really goofy. The legs and
feet are far too small, and half of his entire body just kinda hangs out
the sides. I definitely don't recommend the time and effort to transform
Prime into this mode, as there's nothing really good about it.

         Even though he's smaller,
this version of Energon Megatron isn't a different mold-- it's just the
downsized Japanese version. He has all the detailing, articulation, etc.,
of the larger
         <a href="enmegatron.html">
          $40 toy
         </a>
         . So no new comments
there. I have to say, this Ultra size category is much more appropriate
for Megatron than a Super size class. The toy just wasn't complex enough
for a $40 toy. It's certainly a good size at $25, though, and you don't
lose a thing play-wise. In fact, you might actually GAIN some play value,
since he's more in scale with the other Energon figures now. The only downside
to him mold-wise is that his antlers in robot mode tend to pop out rather
easily. As you may be able to tell from the comparison shots above, Megatron's
color scheme is basically the same, but there are many small variations.
The blue is a bit lighter, the transparent blue-green plastic is now a
more suiting normal transparent green, and some of the purple has been
changed to dark blue, among other, more minor things. I don't think the
colors mesh quite as well as they did on the $40 version, though-- the
blue is just a few shades too light, and the sickly blue color used for
Megatron's robot face doesn't make him look... healthy. Another small change
is that the sounds for the tank attachment have been changed; when you
fire the missile, it's now a shorter, less annoying firing sound, and when
you make it into a sword, a "clang" effect is made. They're certainly less
annoying than $40 Megatron's sounds, that that respect.

          This is a pretty good
set, priced at just $25 U.S.- you're basically getting Optimus for free.
The downsized Megatron is a much more reasonable size for the toy, even
if the color scheme isn't quite as good, and Prime has the added benefit
of being able to Powerlinx with other Autobots. (Though I still wouldn't
qualify him as a good toy-- just slightly better than $40 Prime.) If you
only want one version each of Energon Prime and Megatron, I'd definitely
recommend this set over buying their larger versions both individually
for a total of $80 U.S.
