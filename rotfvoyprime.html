    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Target Exclusive Robovision
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Robovision

     This redeco of voyager-class
Optimus Prime is pretty much just a re-release of the mold for the Revenge
of the Fallen line, so that those who missed any of the versions of the
toy released for the first movie can pick him up. There's some minor changes,
but only ultra-completists should really care. Overall, Prime's color scheme
has been "dulled down" a bit when compared to the
     <a href="movvoyprime.html">
      original
release
     </a>
     of this toy-- the blue is now a duller, slightly darker blue,
and same with red. The gray has been replaced with a light goldish tan,
which makes it look like "older" and "faded" metal. The overall color scheme
is definitely Optimus Prime through-and-through, though. The only real
change when it comes to paint apps is the faded gold Autobot symbol on
the side of his truck mode in place of a few more flame paint apps that
were on the original, gold "fake windows" on his robot chest. In addition,
in a bit of an homage to the first big action scene of the movie, Prime
has "Big General" in Chinese written on the top of his truck mode... though
it can also apparently be translated as "chief chef", oddly enough...

     No mold changes have
been made to RotF Voyager Optimus Prime.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     If you already have
a version of this mode, the RotF initial release of voyager-class Optimus
Prime isn't nearly different enough to pick up. However, if you still have
yet to pick the mold up, it's an excellent design with a pretty good color
scheme-- ignoring the Chinese snafu, I think I like the duller scheme slightly
better than the original, but it all comes down to whether you prefer a
duller or more primary color schemes as to whether I recommend you pick
up this one of the original movie's version instead.

       From the moment Optimus Prime took Earth
as a new home for himself and his people, he was rededicated to its protection.
Since that day he has focused all of his considerable will and power on
rooting out the last few Decepticons and destroying them. To that end he
has upgraded and refined his sensor suite, and trained with Ironhide in
tracking the evil robots.
