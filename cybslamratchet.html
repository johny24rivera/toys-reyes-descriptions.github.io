    Cyber Slammer Ratchet's
vehicle mode is a chibi-fied H2 Hummer ambulance, with the rather cartoonish,
exaggerated proportions that you'd expect for a toy aimed at the little
bitty kiddies. He's wider and "stubbier" proportionally than he should
be, and the front part of the ambulance is much larger proportionally that
it should be in comparison to the back part, but obviously this is intentional
given the Cyber Slammers' target audience. As far as his mold detailing
goes, it's definitely simple, again understandable given the target audience--
it's used where needed, but not in many other places (though, understandably,
he does have considerably more mold detailing in robot mode). The overall
color scheme doesn't outright clash, but I've never been a fan of Movie
Ratchet's "pea green" colors, and this toy isn't any exception to that
rule. The black and red do fit well against the green, though, and the
dark metallic blue is a great-looking color for windows. The "Autobot ambulance
symbols" on Ratchet's doors are missing, but he does have the characteristic
red "heart beat" line painted on the sides this mode.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Ratchet can be locked in ambulance mode by pushing the white tab on the
bottom of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Ratchet's robot
body into his vehicle mode, the ambulance will take off (providing he's
on a flat surface), and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode
body will pop back up again. Because of this gimmick, Ratchet doesn't really
have any lower body in robot mode, just most of his vehicle mode. His main
body, head, and arms are molded onto the underside of his vehicle mode
roof and doors. What's more, he doesn't "straighten out" all the way in
this mode-- his upper body leans forward slightly, due to all the bulk
on the rear end of his vehicle mode. It doesn't look nearly as good as
on the sleeker Cyber Slammers, like, say,
    <a href="cybslambarricade.html">
     Barricade
    </a>
    .
The robot parts are very well-detailed, though, both when it comes to paint
and the mold itself. Using the "cutesy eye paint apps" doesn't really work
well on Ratchet, though-- his face just doesn't scream "cute" no matter
what you do with it, so trying to make it that way looks... odd, to say
the least. As for articulation, Ratchet has the same points of movement
as all Cyber Slammers-- his head can turn and his arms can move at the
shoulders, though the latter snap back into their default position after
you let go of them.

    Cyber Slammer Ratchet
is my least favorite of the sub-line, due to his not-so-great head design,
so-so color scheme, and the fact that's he's defintiely overly bulky in
robot mode with that big vehicle roof backpack. Only recommended if you're
a completist.
