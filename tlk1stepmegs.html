    TLK Megatron's 1-step
changer version, at least from the top, looks pretty good in his futuristic
jet mode. He's got a nice long cockpit (though it could stand to be a TITCH
slimmer), pretty accurately-sized main body, and wings coming out of the
sides that are a bit slim, but still within the range of acceptable, especially
for a 1-step changer. From a more side-on view, though, the proportions
are decidedly less impressive, as he's far too thick vertically-- you can
clearly see the robot chest and leg details from a side view, and the feet
stick out even moreso, way below where you'd want them to be. He manages
to stay fairly level in spite of this, though I wish he had an actual landing
gear up front as opposed to just a large bump down there covering up his
robot face. The mold detailing is pretty good in this mode, with angular
lines on the cockpit, exhaust pipes, wings, and the like, though nothing
particularly intricate. The "engine" details near the center are a bit
overly simplified, though, and the rear of the body itself just doesn't
"mesh" as well with his actual details when compared to most of TLK Megatron's
other toys. The colors are true to his other toys; he's mostly a dark milky
gray with a hint of blue in it, and his paint apps in this mode are all
a golden yellow (beyond the silver Decepticon symbol), with paint on the
cockpit and engine. I really would've liked another minor color here, but
again, 1-step Turbo Changer-- can't get your expectations up TOO high here.

    Megatron's transformation
isn't exactly 1-step-- it's more like 3 or 4 steps. First fold up his wings
to the sides, fold back each of his feet, and then, by rotating his folded-up
wings forward, the rest of the toy auto-transforms. The end result is...
okay, but it's the weaker of Megatron's two modes. The main body and legs
look great-- everything is pretty proportional (beyond his chest, which
should be wider), and the mold detailing is incredibly impressive for a
toy of such size-- ridged armor plating is everywhere, and all the necessary
details are there plus some. His armor "skirt", claws, angular knees, asymmetrical
chest, and demonic-looking round head with horns on the sides are all present.
His arms, however, are very weak, being just molded onto panels that become
the top of his jet mode (he does at least have holes in his hands to hold
appropriately-sized weapons). Worse, the way he transforms, they aren't
entirely straight-- move them forward at the shoulders (his only useful
articulation in this mode), and they actually angle inwards towards his
body, not straight-out. He also does have some noticeable kibble-- the
two wings behind his arms are especially obvious, but he has some hinges
on the sides of his body that are part of the transformation, as well as
a bit hanging between his legs and the nosecone behind his back. Although
his plastic is still all gray in this mode, he does have more paint thankfully--
gold on his mid-arms, feet, and abs; red on his eyes; and dark silvery
gray on his face, middle of his chest, gauntlets, and nicely outlining
his "skirt" pieces. Unlike most other TLK 1-step changers, Megatron has
his "Cyberfire" UV-activated paint app only visible in his robot mode--
namely, on much of his left pec, with a Decepticon symbol in the middle
of it and with flame apps near the top of said pec. It looks cool, but
kinda forced compared to most other Cyberfire paint apps.

    The 1-step changer version
of TLK Megatron is the toy of his I'd recommend the least. His vehicle
mode looks nice from the top, but is far too bulky from the side. As for
the robot mode, his arms are very oddly done, and he's got a lot of kibble.
Get one of his bigger simple toys-- like his
