    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Blackout w/ Scorponok toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Interestingly enough,
Premium Blackout is, overall, LESS accurate to his movie version than the
original toy. The reason for this is because of the replacing of his black
parts in robot mode with light tan parts, for some reason I can't figure
out. The tan parts don't clash with the surrounding colors at all, mind
you, but the black they already had there was entirely movie-accurate.
Plus, though it still looks good, I don't think the tan looks quite as
good as the black against the dull blue. Speaking of the blue, it's been
made duller and flatter, and most of it has been given a light black paint
wash to really bring out the details-- it works magnificiently well, and
really brings some "worn down" realism to the vehicle mode. The silver
"worn metal" paint apps are also a welcome addition to Premium Blackout,
as are the military markings on the tail fin, such as the "4500X" highlighted
in the introductory scene to the movie. Blackout's head and waist have
also gotten some nice silver paint apps, which look especially good on
the face, and make him more movie-accurate (though, as noted, this is more
than offset by the inclusion of the tan). Blackout's miniature partner
Scorponok has also gotten more considerably more paint apps, with his legs,
claws, and head painted an appropriate golden color, which really looks
great on him.

     No mold changes have
been made to Premium Blackout-- so, sadly, his Automorph gimmick still
doesn't work.

     Premium Blackout may
have the less movie-accurate tan, but overall I'd recommend him
     <i>
      slightly
     </i>
     over the original Blackout because of the incredibly well-done job on the
vehicle mode, what with the worn paint apps, the additional military apps,
and the nice black paint wash. Plus, Scorpy's actually painted this time
around, which is always good.

       The only goals Blackout ever had were
to serve Megatron, fight for Decepticon dominance, and be the most perfect
soldier he could. He follows orders without question, even to the point
of self-termination, and maintains himself and his weapons in pristine
condition. The other Decepticons may choose the easy road, letting their
bodies gather scratches and dents, but Blackout knows discipline is the
prerequisite to power.
