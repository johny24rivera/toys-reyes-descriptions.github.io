    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated voyager Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated voyager
Optimus Prime

     Like other redecos of
various versions of Optimus Prime into the Stunticon leader, this Animated
version shares the basic black, bluish gray, and dark purple color scheme
of Motormaster's G1 version. The particular shades used for the colors
on this version are pretty darned snazzy, though-- the black is a VERY
black, "midnight-esque" color, and the dark purple pops in a way that's
a bit hard to describe, but it goes with the other colors excellently,
despite being flat like most of the colors on other Animated figures. The
light bluish gray is also of a tint that makes it go well with the purple,
to boot. The accent colors are really what make this toy look great, though.
The silver just goes brilliantly with the black and purple, and to add
that little something extra, there's some bright green. In any real amount,
this would look garish, but as an accent color it gives The Motormaster
that slight "professional wrestler" vibe he's supposed to have (he's a
bit of an homage to the late Randy "Macho Man" Savage) while still going
with the other colors quite nicely.

     The Motormaster has
a new headsculpt, made to look like a "head squeezed into a box", which
is how the G1 Motormaster toy looked (to a less exaggerated extent, of
course). The grimace on Motormaster's face and the "mustache" looks great,
but I'm just not fond of the box around the head on this version-- it just
looks off on this body, not fitting with the "line flow" of it at all,
in my opinion. I'm also not really liking the pinkish color of his face.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Motormaster has
some excellent, eye-catching colors, and done in a way that pretty much
only the Animated line could pull off. The new face sculpt isn't all that
great and seems out-of-place, but ignoring that, this is a really nicely
done redeco.

       The Motormaster brings vanity to a whole
new level. He annoys the Stunticons (and everyone else) with bombastic
proclamations and his habit of referring to himself in the third person.
Secretly, he is insecure about his place among the much larger Decepticons.
He has reinforced trauma buffers and shock absorbers, making him likely
to survive any collision. His greatest weakness is his disloyalty he inspires
in those under his command.
