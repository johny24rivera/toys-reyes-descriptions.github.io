    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
car transport. Of course, as you can probably tell from the above picture,
Ultra Magnus is basically a recolored
    <a href="g1prime.html">
     Optimus Prime
cab
    </a>
    with a different trailer. The thing is, the cab looks entirely
too small when compared to the trailer. Car transports do NOT have that
large of trailers at all... It actually looks like you're mixing and matching
two different toys, and I don't like that. At least he can fit up to four
deluxe-sized cars on him in this mode, though. Magnus has two missile-firing
pieces on the front of his cab, but not that they've had to go and elongate
the missiles to fit current safety standards, they look stupid. Grrr...
You also have nowhere to store his robot mode fists, his hand-held gun,
or his head piece, or his chest piece.

    Ultra Magnus' "regular"
robot mode- never ever seen on the show- is basically just the Optimus
Prime cab toy, but white with a smidge of blue. Rather boring colors, but
otherwise I have the same comments here as I have about the cab portion
of the Prime toy: This mode is pretty darn articulated for a G1 toy- he
can move at the shoulders, elbows, feet, knees, and hips (although there's
no forward movement in the latter two areas). Which makes him one of the
few G1 toys you can actually put in a "running" pose. His arms are a bit
wimpy-looking, though, especially when compared to his large chest. His
fists you also just attach to his arms- they're seperate pieces- which
I think is kinda weak, myself. The diecast metal bits are part of his toes
and chest.

    Ultra Magnus' "super"
robot mode, in which he combines with his trailer, is the one we're more
familiar with. It's a step down from the cab toy in terms of looks, though,
especially when compared to his huge lower feet. He has a very blank, vacant
stare, and he's basically just a rectangle with arms and a head- his legs
look entirely too much like they're just one big leg. All he can move are
his arms at the shoulders and elbows. His thin upper legs don't help the
look much, either. However, I do like the long white rectangular pillars
coming out the top of his arms- they certainly accentuate this mode. And
his gun can be held in both robot modes! Nifty!

    Ultra Magnus is a white
Prime that can combine with his trailer. Which really isn't a bad idea.
Too bad he has so many pieces that can't fit anywhere in his vehicle mode,
and his combined mode can't move much at all. Add to that the $40 price
tag, and you're better off just getting either Magnus OR Prime- I wouldn't
recommend both unless you're a completist.

      Ultra Magnus is all soldier. Most comfortable
when carrying out the orders of Optimus Prime. Possesses supreme fighting
skills and a gift for battlefield improvisation. Reluctant whenever he
has to be the leader in a mission but has a natural ability to command.
Unswervingly determined, fair, and courageous. Exhibits hesitancy and self-doubt
at times about his decisions. Carries missile launchers capable of hitting
a target 30 miles away. Resolute, fair, and courageous beyond reproach.
Ready to sacrifice himself for the good of others or the mission.
