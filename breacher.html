    Breacher's vehicle mode
is an amphibious assault vehicle. It's also perfectly sized to fit on the
back of
    <a href="aaseaspray.html">
     Sea Spray's
    </a>
    vehicle mode-- I always
love it when they engineer cross-compatibility on Transformers, particularly
between size classes! Anyways, the vehicle mode itself is pretty spot-on
proportionally, with no robot mode extras visible at all-- even from the
back end. The mold detailing is particularly excellent, with little bolts,
door panels, and vents all over the place. Unfortunately, only the details
on the front third or so of the vehicle are detailed-- the rest are just
on unpainted dark blue plastic. It's a shame, because the couple of contrast
colors used for the paint apps-- such as silver and white-- contrast quite
well with the dark blue and would help to break it up a bit more in this
mode. I mean, there's SOME black to provide some contrast from the dark
end of the spectrum, but it's mostly just the gun and the wheels. As for
movement, as you'd expect the turret can rotate, and the dual-barreled
gun can move up and down, so Breacher can aim at pretty much anything.

    The transformation to
Breacher's robot mode isn't exactly HARD, but it is considerably more complex
than almost any other Scout-sized Transformer I can think of-- so fair
warning if you or the person you're planning on getting this toy for doesn't
do well with transformations that aren't easy. As for the robot mode itself,
most of the vehicle mode parts integrate quite well into the robot mode--
particularly on the chest, which, via some ingenious folding and swiveling,
actually contrains most of the front third of the vehicle mode PLUS the
turret. (That said, from a side angle his chest does look a little odd.)
The headlights serve as nice pads to the side of the chest, and the back
half of the vehicle mode serves as pretty well-proportioned legs. Part
of the rear section of the vehicle mode also becomes a nice "skirt flap"
behind the butt, which is another good use of vehicle parts. About the
only exception to this well-done integration are the panels that hang rather
blatantly off the forearms, and don't fit in at all with Breacher's fairly
slender form. I think it would've looked better if they had been attached
to the shoulders as armor, instead. The color scheme is much more varied
in this mode, with the contrast colors of white and black getting a lot
more "face time", along with some nice detailing colors like red and even
some nice light green for the eyes. (Speaking of the face, it's very well-detailed,
and a fairly unique design fitting an Autobot, though it fits a "traditional"-styled
Transformer more than a Movie universe toy.) Breacher also has SEVEN places
where you can attach "clip weapons"-- on the ends of each of his fists,
as well as on his back, the pieces of armor attached to his forearms, and
two places on his "skirt flap". Given that the gun part of his turret comes
off and becomes a clip weapon, this is certainly appropriate for the figure,
and gives it even more cross-compatibility with other Transformers' accessories.
As for articluation, Breacher's no slouch in that area, either-- he can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, wrists, hips, knees,
and ankles-- and most of those are on ball joints. He doesn't have waist
movement, though, even though it appears that he does form pictures (that's
a result of the transformation).

    Breacher is fantastic
Scout figure with a very satisfying transformation and looks generally
great in both modes, whether you're talking about proportions or color
scheme. His big panels on his forearms in robot mode and the odd shape
his chest has from a side angle are the only real substantial knocks I
have against him-- highly recommended.

      Teamed up with his friend Sea Spray,
Breacher comes crashing out of the surf to deliver a nasty shock to Crankstart.
The Decepticon was foolish enough to think he could hide on a remote island
on the East African shore, but Breacher is just as comfortable at sea as
he is on land.
