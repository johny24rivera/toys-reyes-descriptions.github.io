     The new version of the
"G1 European/G2" Clench character has the same crazy color schemes that
originate from that early '90s time period for Transformers, and as Fun
Publications has proven in the past with their exclusives, the paint job
is quite accurate to the original and the whole thing definitely gives
a "new look" to a classic character. Of course, given the time period,
it's almost impossible for Clench NOT to get some kind of nauseatingly
bright color, and, being the big big boss guy, he gets... pink. Obviously.
Normally this is the point where I'd go "so if you're not part of the niche
audience you won't like it, 'cause it's pink. On a Transformer".... but
not so with Clench. Even though pink is actually used in enough places
to make it a borderline "primary" color, it's used in small amounts in
several places so that it actually comes across as an accent color. And,
dare I say it, for some reason I think it goes exceptionally well with
Clench's other colors. The dull blue-green is just beautiful-- it has some
nice bits of metallic flake here and there in it that really make it look
gorgeous (and accurate to the original Clench toy). Black, of course, is
a nice dark color to offset the pink and some of the other brighter colors,
and works well in the amount it's used. The bright green accnets on the
shield, waist, eyes, and transparent plastic-- together with the pink,
it makes Clench almost look like he'd fit well under a blacklight (a fact
that Fun Pub used to their advantage by releasing a Clench blacklight poster
at the convention). The copper shoulders also work nicely, as does the
gray shield-- heck, it all works in an odd sort of way. There's also some
really nice decals, such as the G2 Decepticon symbols on his shield and
right shoulder as well as the bizarre "lightning-bolt-through-a-wolf" decals
near the front of his vehicle mode that are a pretty good replica of the
same symbols on the original Clench. The odd blue "curvy lines" down the
center of his chest also look pretty good against the black as well.

     Clench has a new head
mold, which not only goes well with the overall look of the toy but is
a fantastic head sculpt in and of itself. It reflects the original Clench's
head design while modernizing it slightly by making the "cattle horns"
bigger on this bad boy with a Texas license plate and making him just generally
look meaner. The gas-mask-esque detailing for a mouth also works wonders,
too. No other mold changes were made to Clench, though like almost every
other large Botcon exclusives, the electronics have been gutted to make
the limited-run toy a bit cheaper for folks.

     The "new G2" Clench
is a wonderful update to an obscure character and the face sculpt really,
REALLY fits the character and the mold itself. Unlike many of the other
toys in this year's set, I wouldn't necessarily rule this guy out just
because he has pink on him if you're not one of those "it's so hideous
it's awesome" kinda people. The other colors genuinely work well with it,
and he has a very "blacklight" feel to his character. My favorite toy from
the 2010 set when it comes to mold changes and execution, and my second-favorite
when it comes to overall color scheme. Makes a great centerpiece to any
G2 collection, whether you have the other Botcon 2010 toys or not.

       From the moment he came online, Clench
was trouble. Created as a security bot, he completely trashed the Cyberfactory
that gave him life a mere ten minutes earlier. Within days, he had gathered
the disaffected and angry among the Earth-born Cybertronians and created
the Decepticon Syndicate, crushing anything in his path. His sole motivation
seems to be a seething core of universal hatred that fuels him more than
any energon. He has no true designs for usurping Galvatron or Zarak, but
figures, someday, they're going to get in his way...

       Even before the forestonite experiment,
Clench was a terrifying monster in battle. Now his nearly impenetrable
armor and Colossus Cannons are augmented with the ability to create localized
gravity wells up to ten times Earth's pull, leaving his targets utterly
helpless before his wrath.
