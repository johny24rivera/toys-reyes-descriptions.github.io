    Beast mode is a robotic
scorpion. There arent many moveable parts in this mode; only his claws.
This is kind of crummy looking and not a very cool beast mode; his robot
legs are showing very clearly from any view except one from directly above.
For a Happy Meal toy, the detailing is pretty nice, though.

    Robot mode is defintely
the crummier of the two. His hands are just engravements on the plastic
on the underside of his scorpion claws. His face is engraved on the bottom
of his beast face and doesnt look like Scorponok at all. His hips have
a bolt running through them and look very odd. His only moveable parts
are his shoulders and his upper legs. His stinger sticks out of his bottom
and looks kind of odd; it doesnt look like it can be used as a weapon
like the original Beast Wars

    A kind of weak transformer
in both modes; not very recommended. If you have the money, buy one of
the toys that are five bucks or above.
