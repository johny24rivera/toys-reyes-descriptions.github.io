    Beast mode is a FREAKY
combination of a hornet with a lionfish head. This beast mode is well-designed
and fits together well, but it just looks too freaky, even for a fuzor.
The robot legs can be seen under the bottom of the abdomen, however. The
action feature for this mode is that, if you unhook the fish head from
its neck base plate, the head will spring forward, and its fins on the
top of its head will spread apart and dart out a little. What exact action
this is supposed to symbolize, I'm not sure....

    Robot mode is even weirder
than beast mode. Although almost all of the rest of the body is okay, his
head is just the lionfish with the robot head pulled out of the mouth,
so his head is almost as big as the rest of his body! Despite this, it
still stands up well. There are some extras besides the head, though. His
insect legs stick out of the back and his wings get in the way, and he
has bee bulb plates under his hands.

    Good in a freakish way
in beast mode, but just extremely freaky in robot mode.

      Hes got a face only a Predacon could
love, but according to Injector, the vainest of the Predacons, he is the
best thing to happen since Energon. Fused into two beasts - half lionfish,
half hornet - he is as dangerous as it gets. He is armed with a massive
stinger and thrusting splines that inject his victims with a paralyzing
poison; in robot mode he wields a devastating stinger missile. Charismatic,
clever, and evil to the core, Injector represents one of the Maximals
greatest threats.
