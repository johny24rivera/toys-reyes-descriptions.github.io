    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 3-step Blizzard
Strike Drift toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
RID2015 3-step Blizzard Strike Drift toy

     Given the odd choice
that the first release of this mold was in Drift's "Blizzard Strike" deco,
you KNEW a regular version had to be coming, and here it is, roughly a
year later. Since it's not a "themed" variant but a redeco into Drift's
normal color scheme on an existing mold, there's not many surprises here.
One thing I will say is that the orange plastic on this version of Drift
is... not necessarily bright so much as BOLD-- it really pops, and stands
out on any shelf, more than just a normal light orange would. It's a really
good shade of the color. It makes the black contrast all the more against
it-- on the wheels, the knees, the "belts" across his robot chest, his
hands, lines on his shoulders, his windows, and on wide stripes on the
grill-to-sides of his vehicle mode. Drift's somewhat dull dark red is used
on the toy as well-- on the rear spoiler/feet, the faux robot antennae
on his front grill (and the real robot antennae on his head), and on angled
stripes on his car doors. He does, unfortunately, have some of that boring
light milky gray plastic, but thankfully it's confined to his upper legs
and upper arms, so it's a minor contributor to the overall scheme. There's
also a bit of silver on his face, and moderately light blue on his headlights
and eyes. (Sadly the back end of his vehicle mode is unpainted again, sans
the spoiler.)

     Surprisingly, Drift
DOES have a mold change-- the facesculpt has been changed so that instead
of having his faceplate up, it's down now, with his familar trim "mustache
and beard" look across his somewhat stern face. I kinda wish the "facial
hair" had been painted black, but otherwise it looks good.

     The 3-step changer version
of RID2015 Drift in his "normal" colors looks great, with really eye-catching
orange contrasting excellently against all those black bits and stripes
and most of his other, more minor, colors. The mold itself is a winner
too, and fun to transform-- if you're looking for a simplified, show-accurate
version of RID2015 Drift and don't mind the lack of articulation, this
is easily my most recommended version. (That said, I like the Blizzard
Strike scheme slightly better.)
