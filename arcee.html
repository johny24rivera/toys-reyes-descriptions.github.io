    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Blackarachnia Transmetal
2. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Blackarachnia Transmetal
2

     Finally, Transfans get
a toy of Arcee! (For those of you who don't know, Arcee was a female character
in the original Transformers that, sadly, never got a toy.) Of course,
this toy is really just a repaint of Blackarachnia Transmetal 2, but it's
close enough- it even has a color scheme similar to Arcee's old form!

     Arcee's beast mode is
a spider. While a Transmetal 2 spider is cool nonetheless, the white and
light blue in this mode don't mix together well with the whole "creepy
spider" feel that this mold should have going for it. The only mold change
apparent in this mode is the fact that, instead of a spark crystal that
can switch between Maximal and Predacon, Arcee has a spark crystal that
can switch between a Maximal symbol and an Autobot symbol! This is the
first mold change made to a Botcon toy, even if it is a slight one.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     In robot mode, Arcee's
lack of paint detailing becomes more apparent. Coupled with her white skin,
this makes her look almost like a prototype in this mode, and this is NOT
good. For such an expensive toy as this, more paint detailing would have
been appreciated. As with the beast mode, the white, light blue, and pink
colorations do not fit with this toy. Another mold change to this toy is
apparent in this mode as well: the stupid "extra bra" is gone, leaving
behind the "armor bra" used on Blackarachnia Transmetal 2 in the show,
which, in my opinion, looks much cooler. There's even an Autobot symbol
engraved on the upper left corner of it, which is a neat reference to Arcee's
roots as well!
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     All in all, it's nice
to see a Botcon Exclusive that has some mold changes, but that's about
all Arcee excels at. She still has the same problems as Blackarachnia Transmetal
2, plus the bad paint detailing and the odd white, pink, and light blue
coloration. I recommend Blackarachnia Transmetal 2 above this toy, personally.

       Once viewed as an almost maternal figure
among Autobots, Arcee has continued to find ways to improve herself since
the days of the Great War. After a series of personal traumatic events,
she secluded herself from her comrades, honing her combat skills and mental
focus. Her mysterious reemergence with a new body has turned heads of friends
and foes alike. Now a master of Crystalocution, by which she attacks her
enemies at their fracture points, and the lost art of Tekkaido, Arcee continues
to strike fear into her opponents. In her new form, she also wields deadly
energy blades, localized deflector shields, and reportedly has precognizance
of one's imminent death, thus making it difficult to gain her trust.
