    Starscream's jet mode--
in comparison to his smaller
    <a href="prifestarscream.html">
     First Edition
version
    </a>
    -- is a bit darker-colored on this version, and a bit pointier.
The dark and light shades of bluish green still dominate the toy-- as they
are wont to do, given that they're his show colors-- but the darker shade
is definitely the more dominant now, compared to the lighter shade on his
First Edition toy. One interesting thing about his wings-- they LOOK like
there's a darker stripe of paint going down the center of them, but this
actually just the "smooth" color of the plastic, whereas the plastic near
the edges of the wings is molded slightly "roughed up" to give it a lighter
look. It's an interesting application of mold detailing to achieve slight
color differences without actually being, y'know... different colors. I
am glad for the bits of light orangish red paint on Starscream's main body
and tailfins, though, as they bring light color to a toy that's largely
pretty dull. The transparent dark purple on Starscream's cockpit window
and weapon is also a nice shade, but it complements the main colors, and
there needs to be a bit more contrast here. There's just a touch of medium
blue on the rear exhaust port, which is a really nice color and contrasts
well with the dark bluish gray-- I really wish this had been used a bit
more on the toy. Proportionally, the wings and cockpit are a bit larger
compared to the First Edition toy, with a bit more "meat" in the tail section
of the jet. In addition, though it's still fairly obvious that Starscream's
robot legs are on the bottom of the jet mode (sorry, but he doesn't have
any landing gear), they're turned sideways and "mesh" with the overall
jet body better this time, so it isn't so much "this is the jet, and these
are the legs dangling below it" as it is with the First Edition mold. There's
also removable (non-firing) individual missile attachments underneath each
wing, and a couple of really un-needed extraneous points in this mode that
come with his transformation (such as the spikes on the sides of his tail
and the cockpit). These aren't a huge deal, but they aren't show-accurate,
to be certain. Like with the other 2012 Prime voyagers, Starscream has
a "Powerizer" weapon that is usually just a big block of unaerodynamic
nothing in vehicle mode, pegging in slightly behind his cockpit. If you
press down on the gray section, the transparent purple bit also rotates
forward to form an energy weapon, with a red LED light going off in the
center of the weapon when you do this-- and, just like most other Powerizer
weapons, it's not nearly strong enough to light up the whole weapon, particularly
when the transparent plastic is this dark. More annoyingly, like most other
Powerizer weapons it snaps back into its "block of unrecognizable stuff"
mode whenever you don't have the trigger pressed down.

    In robot mode, Starscream
retains his lanky look from the show extremely well-- in fact, in the legs,
I think he's perhaps a bit TOO lanky/long, though otherwise the proportions
on this mode are pretty admirably show-accurate. The wings hang off his
back, but enhance his silouhette, and look pretty nice as-is, so as far
as kibble goes I don't mind those bits. What I DO mind are the pieces of
his jet back end on the sides of his feet-- they just hang off there, with
nowhere to peg in, and are probably the biggest eyesores in this mode (though
at least they help with Starscream's stability a bit). His cockpit is also
right behind his butt, which looks a little weird and has his crotch at
a slight angle, though this is a minor issue. There's also a couple of
other slight oddities on his arms-- his shoulder panels are a bit overly
flat, being part of the body of his jet mode split in half, and the wing-halves
that make up most of his lower arms also aren't quite as show-accurate
as his arms are on the First Edition toy. As far as negatives go, one final
downside is that as skinny as he's supposed to be, Starscream's stomach
is absolutely emaciated compared to his chest-- a side effect of the "2012
Prime voyager's chests are supposed to glow" gimmick that should happen
if you plug Starscream's Powerizer weapon into his back and turn it on.
Of course, this doesn't work at all (and neither does it work if you place
it in Starscream's transparent purple forearms), so it just looks weird
instead. Beyond his huge Powerizer weapon, his missiles on his wings can
also plug into his forearm holes, which I much prefer instead. As far as
mold detailing, it's fairly sparse as on most Prime-aesthetic toys, but
in a few areas-- like his pelvis, chest, and head-- it's done wonderfully
well, and is remarkably show-accurate. Plus, with Starscream's skinny,
angular arms, it's hardly noticeable if you're one who likes a lot of mold
detailing on his TFs. The paint detailing in this mode is mostly on his
head, chest, and upper arms, but given the color variation it still works
with Starscream's admittedly dull but show-accurate color scheme. For articulation,
Starscream can move at the head (at two points, so if you don't want him
to be very hunchbacked like on the show he doesn't have to be), shoulders
(at two points), elbows, wrists, hips (at three points), slightly forward
at the waist, and he can also move at the knees and ankles. A bit of rotation
at the knees would've been appreciated, but otherwise he's pretty darned
posable, especially given his stance and those aforementioned jet thruster
halves giving him some extra stability.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Whether I recommend
Prime voyager Starscream to you over his First Edition counterpart largely
depends on one question-- which is more important to you, an excellent
robot mode or an excellent vehicle mode? If the robot mode matters the
most to you, get the First Edition version. This version is the one with
a considerably better vehicle mode, however, and though his robot mode
does have some minor kibble issues, it's not so much worse I'd unequivocably
recommend the First Edition version in every situation.

      Starscream hasn't survived this long
simply by running away every time he might lose a fight. Every retreat
is a calculated risk, designed to fulfill a greater purpose. It is often
when his enemies believe they are winning that Starscream turns and finishes
them off.
