    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Activator Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Activator Starscream

     As usual, Starscream
gets repainted as one of his Seeker brethren, and although Thundercracker
is generally an homage to his
     <a href="g1thundercracker.html">
      G1 self
     </a>
     ,
there's been a bit of divergence this time around. Yes, he's still primarily
dark blue, but in addition to silver and black as secondary color, he's
also got a nice shade of purple to contrast against all the dark black.
It's really quite a great move, in my opinion, keeping the color scheme
close enough to seem "familiar" but still making it its own thing. And
in this case, I think it works even better than the G1 color scheme-- the
purple goes VERY well against the dark blue to the point where I wish there
were more of it and less of the black, which doesnt' contrast against the
dark blue all that well, though it certainly doesn't look bad or clash
or anything. The silver accents also look quite good, as they always have
against dark blue (which on this toy has an ever-so-slight purplish tint
to it, which is of course fitting). I wish a few more silver paint apps
were visible in robot mode to add a bit more color variance-- particularly
on the legs-- but that's a very small quibble, as Thundercracker has enough
paint apps for a toy of his size overall. The gold Decepticon emblems on
the wings are also a very nice touch (and they're the "regular" Decepticon
emblems this time, unlike Activators Starscream who had movie Decepticon
emblems for some strange reason).

     Activators Thundercracker
is one of the best Animated Activators molds, done up in a very well-done
color scheme and at a very affordable price point to boot. What's not to
recommend?

       This ego crazy clone of Starscream is
so full of himself, it's tough for him to pay attention to anything else.
He sometimes gets distracted by the beautiful shape of his own shadow on
the clouds beneath him, or his reflection in the windows of buildings as
he flies past. That doesn't make him any less dangerous to the Autobots
he attacks though!
