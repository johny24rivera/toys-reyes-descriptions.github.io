    Inferno's vehicle mode
is slightly below-average for an early Generation One toy, but that's not
to say it's bad. It's generally pretty realistic, with clear windows (with
no robot extras visible inside), excellent proportions, rubber wheels,
chrome silver stuff- y'know, the standard for the early G1 toys. And heck,
his fire truck ladder even extends to nearly twice its length if you so
desire. The he's also got soem nice "F.D." and Autobot insignia decals
on him- notice I said DECALS, not STICKERS. For some reason, Hasbro decided
to opt out of stickers for those parts and just put on paint apps. Those
are the only differences between Reissue Inferno and the "real" G1 Inferno
that I'm aware of. The thing that kind of bugs me about this mode is that
it's rather obvious that the sides of the fire truck become the robot's
arms. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but actual fire trucks don't have
arms-without-hands sticking out of their sides. Other than that, it's a
pretty nice mode.

    Robot mode is about
average for a G1 toy- some of the proportions are a bit wonky, and he has
almost zero articulation. (Only his shoulders [at two points] and his elbows
can move.) His chest is a bit big and flat, but it's not nearly as bad
as it is on most of the other Autobots. Head is... not too small, which
is uncommon for a G1 toy. It also has some nice silver, blue, and paint
detailing- although it does have the back end of the vehicle mode coming
out of the back of it, which doesn't look that great. He also has little
"wing" pieces that you plug into place in the sides of his head- I'm not
really sure WHY they're there, though, since they aren't storable in the
other mode, and they don't really DO anything in this mode either. Speaking
of extra parts, you can also swap out Inferno's hands for gun-welders-
although this leaves you with the problem of what to do with the parts
you're not using. Grrr....

    Inferno is a pretty
average G1 toy, with a nice vehicle mode, but a pretty brickish robot mode
that also suffers from a few other problems as well. He's certainly not
downright BAD, but for $30 U.S., I'd have to recommend him only to completists
and diehard G1 fans unless you find him on discount.

      The hotter things get, the better he
likes it, and this goes for fires AND fights! Inferno can do anything Earth
fire trucks can in vehicular mode, but is often distracted from his job
to engage in combat. His great strength is thanks to his ceramic-plated
armored skin that can withstand 8000 degrees Celsius. He also has an extinguisher
rifle that shoots flame-suppressing foam, an energy dampening beam to counter
other beams and forearms that shoot missiles. Unfortunately, he doesn't
follow orders well and isn't very mobile as a robot.
