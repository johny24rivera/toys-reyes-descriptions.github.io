    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Class I Episode II Starfighter
Obi-Wan Kenobi. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Class
I Episode II Starfighter Obi-Wan Kenobi

     Saesee Tiin makes his
return to the Star Wars Transformers line as a Class I version of his Episode
II Starfighter design, but unlike the other designs that have made to the
"downsized" conversion to this smaller size, Saesee doesn't keep his old
     <a href="saeseetiin.html">
      Class II
     </a>
     color scheme of mostly shades of
yellow and orange-- rather, he takes the opposite approach on this smaller
version by taking on a vehicle mode with a primarily dark green coloration.
The way the dark green is painted on his vehicle mode bits is particularly
striking, with a surprisingly elabroate deco job for a toy this small.
The bits of yellow and red near the cockpit also help provide a bit of
contrast to the dark green in addition to the "standard" SWTF greyish off-white
coloration used on most of the rest of his vehicle mode. The black paint
used for the cockpit also looks better than silver in that same area. In
mech mode, Saesee Tiin's coloration changes to mostly brown, with a bit
of red and white to help simulate the "clothes" that he's wearing. Only
a little of the dark green makes it to his mech mode (on his lower legs),
making his two modes look quite different indeed despite the simple transformation.
The metallic copper and gold on his head and fists is also a great shade,
and the light green lightsabers complement his color scheme quite well.

     Like many Star Wars
Transformer mold re-uses, Saesee Tiin has no mold changes compared to the
previous release of this toy of Obi-Wan-- except for a new head, which
looks like a mechanized version of his actual head. It looks good enough,
and I like the simplification that the heads get at this scale-- makes
them feel more robotic than technorganicky like many of the Class II head
molds. No issues here.

     Class I Saesee Tiin
takes what is the second-best Class I SWTF mold and gives it a rather striking
dark green-dominated color scheme deco in vehicle mode that makes him slightly
out-do the Obi-Wan version to become my favorite release of the mold. Recommended,
particularly if you don't have the mold or a previous SWTF version of the
character already.
