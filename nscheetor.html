    Beast mode is a cheetah-
or at least, it's supposed to be. This mode looks just as much like a cheetah
as my dog looks like an elm tree. In fact, if it weren't for the orange-yellow
spots on the upper arms and legs, I'd guess this was some kind of futuristic
robotic panther, and not some cheetah. Still, this mode looks pretty cool.
LOOKS. That's about as far as this mode goes. The robotic parts that resemble
armor do so really well, and this is one of the few Beast Machines Maximals
that looks more robotic than organic. The cheetah head, although not show-accurate,
looks VERY evil, even demonic. Pretty creepy, The tail is also done well-
it even has a mini-laser on its tip! The overall stance in this mode is
that of
    <a href="cheetortm2.html">
     Transmetal 2 Cheetor
    </a>
    , as Cheetor's
very hunched over, and he even has a "jet pack" on his back, just like
the Transmetal 2 version! The transparent orange claws looks pretty neat,
too. Cheetor has a very weak "growling" gimmick in this mode. Just like
the other Beast Machines Cheetor toys, if you push Cheetor's cheetah head
from side to side, he "growls". It's exceptionally weak on this toy, however,
and his upper lip moves an almost imperceptible amount. Cheetor's spark
crystal, which is located on his upper back, looks very cool. It's a regular
blue spark crystal underneath a thin orange plastic bubble, and looks VERY
nice. If you press it, Cheetor's front legs move back and forth in a "slashing"
action. However, because of this gimmick, Cheetor's front legs cannot support
his body weight that well, and he almost always slumps down in the front
so far that his head almost touches the ground. This isn't helped by the
fact that his back legs are entirely too long, and the feet are located
too far back to help support the main body. Thus, Cheetor's posability
is severely limited in this mode because of his bad stability.

    Cheetor's robot mode
is very cool-looking, and if it wasn't for the completely different color
scheme, he'd be pretty show-accurate in this mode. However, his transformation
is rather boring, as it's another "stand me up and flip my head" transformation,
which is getting extremely boring at this point. By pressing the triggers
on Cheetor's shoulder pads, swords swing out of their shoulder positions
and right into his hands. Rather nifty. Also, by utilizing the same "slashing"
gimmick mentioned above, Cheetor can slash his twin swords up and down,
which is pretty cool. Unlike the other Beast Machines Cheetor toys, Night
Slash Cheetor is very stable in his robot mode. That's because his beast
mode feet are behind his robot feet. It may look a little odd, but hey,
at least he doesn't fall over if you look at him the wrong way. The detailing
on Cheetor's robot face is incredibly intricate for a deluxe toy. His very
small mouth and chin plate are even painted! The light piping effect that
is supposed to light up his robot eyes doesn't work that well, however.
Cheetor also has very pretty, intricate designs on his transparent orange
chest, and they add to the appearance of this mode a lot. An interesting
note not mentioned in the directions- underneath Cheetor's chest panel
is a metallized circle with red stripes. When you activate Cheetor's "slashing
action", the circle moves back and forth, looking sort of like a peppermint
candy swirling around. A rather nice touch, if not a bit odd for a figure
such as this. Cheetor is also very posable in this mode, much more so than
the other Beast Machine Cheetors, due to his stability. My only complaint
is that his beast tail doesn't really stay up and out of the way on his
back, and it rather sticks out from any view except a head-on view.

    A rather poorly-done
beast mode, but a NEAT robot mode. Definitely the best of the Beast Machines
Cheetors, even though he doesn't have that accurate of a color scheme.
Recommended.

      Night Slash Cheetor's prowess in battle
grows as rapidly as he moves over the surface of Cybertron. Boasts incredible
speed and maneuverability. When used with highly advanced stealth armor,
he's virtually invisible to every known Vehicon radar or tracking system.
Hits before Vehicons even know it. Will eliminate entire battalion of drones
single-handedly. New armor includes vicious dual blade sword attack that
makes all Vehicons keep their distance in battle. His abilities have negative
psychological effect on Vehicon generals, whose drones seem to be useless
in combat.
