    Wheelie's alternate mode
is a toy monster truck, and since it's a toy representing... well, a toy,
having slightly cartoony proportions doesn't bother me in the slightest
(his drivers' seat is a bit overly high, for example, and the truck bed
a bit too short). What does bother me, though are the robot arms tucked
unceremoniously between his wheels. Given the big gap in between his wheels
(as is certainly fitting for a monster truck), it makes his arm pieces
really obvious in this mode, and the clash quite a bit with the overall
look of this mode, as well. In addition, Wheelie's mouth is right THERE
in the truck bed, which is kinda distracting. The color scheme of dark
blue and gray isn't exactly interesting, but it gets the job done-- what
Wheelie really needs is some more paint apps, though. Important details
like his grilled head- and taillights aren't painted.

    In robot mode, Wheelie
really shows how much a Transformer can appear to "change size" in modes.
In vehicle mode he's really compact and tiny, but here he's very spread
out and you can see he's actually on the large side for a deluxe. His transformation
is quite innovative and I'm surprised they were able to get something this
accurate to the movie from that vehicle mode. His proportions are more
or less movie-accurate, with a long neck-mouth, large eyes (though here
they're blocks of plastic with details on them, as opposed to round pieces
with eyebrow pieces hanging off, for obvious safety reasons, though it
does look a bit overly weird). His chest is quite solid, and it contains
Wheelie's main gimmick-- by rotating the switch on his stomach, you can
change his allegiance from Autobot to Decepticon! Pretty cool, given everything
else that's going on with him. I do wish his shoulder-wheels intergrated
with his main body better, as it does on the movie model, but it's still
decent enough here, and the skinny knife-like arms are done very well.
His legs are a little on the weak side, being that the upper parts of them
are a bit flimsy and made of parts of his vehicle mode turned sideways
and whatnot to hide the lack of any real "substance" to that part of his
body. The lower legs are pretty solid, having the "chicken-walker" stance
with a wheel on each foot, though because of said wheel he's not the most
stable Transformer in the line (though he can still stand up much easier
than, say,
    <a href="rotfsideswipe.html">
     deluxe Sideswipe
    </a>
    ). As for his
articulation, Wheelie can move at his neck (at two places), at the place
where each eye connects to his "neck stalk", and at the shoulders, elbows
(at two points), at the base of each thumb, and at the base of the two
fingers on each hand (as one piece, though each set of two fingers can
move at two places). He can also move at the hips (at two points), the
knees (at two points), and the ankles. Again, though, his relative lack
of stability, and some of the pieces in his upper legs clashing with each
other, makes him have less movement in his legs than you'd think from a
read-out of his movable joints there.

    Wheelie is a really
original design, and it's quite amazing how much he "expands" from vehicle
mode to robot mode. The downside is that both modes do have moderate "kibble"
problems, and he's not very stable. Still, a mildly recommended pickup
if you're one for "different" Transformers.

      Autobot Wheelie never really wanted
to be a Decepticon. It's just that, when people start yelling at him, he
tends to do whatever they say. He's easily startled, and simple to scare.
His tiny size makes him an ideal spy, and even though he doesn't like or
agree with the Decepticons, they scare him so much he doesn't know what
to do except obey.
