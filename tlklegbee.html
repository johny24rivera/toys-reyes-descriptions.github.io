    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM legion
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM legion Bumblebee toy

    All of the rest of the
Wave 1 legion TLK figures are redecoes, so of course Bumblebee would be,
too. However, unlike with the others, Bumblebee actually makes sense; visually,
he only has some relatively minor aesthetic differences for his TLK form
compared to his DotM form, most of them in car mode, and at this scale
they're not that big of a deal. (Of course, I would have
    <i>
     preferred
    </i>
    a
new mold, but I can understand this one.) As tends to fit the TLK standard,
Bumblebee has his usual color scheme of an orangish "cheese-like" yellow
and black (the official pics above are a bit washed-out in regards to the
yellow), but with fewer paint apps than his previous iterations. There
is a nice black angled rim along the sides of his car mode, and there's
the "fat dull arrow" paint app on his front hood that's taken the place
of his usual stripes for TLK, along with some black paint on his front
grill and his robot hips (I guess so they blend in with the black plastic
on his upper legs better). Unfortunately, though, the back half of his
car mode is pretty unpainted-- only the front window is covered out of
all the windows, and it's black, same as the front hood paint app. Nothing
on the back end of spoiler, either, which is unfortunate, and no other
black paint apps on his robot mode. At least his robot mode breaks it up
better, with the usual black plastic on the upper legs, wheels, and minor
connector pieces. He's got a small bit of metallic bronze on his all-important
Chevy symbol on his grill, and the usual silver on his face and light blue
on his eyes. The silver Autobot symbol on his chest/front hood is also
framed nicely by the black around it.

    No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee.

    Although this is a pretty
good mold, I'd only recommend this toy for someone who, for some reason,
has never gotten a small movie Bumblebee toy yet, wants one, and doesn't
want to bother looking for an exclusive version. There's superior versions
of this mold in the same basic color scheme but with more (and more varied)
paint apps, and it's not like the car mode is all that accurate to the
TLK toy anyways. If you don't fit into this very specific category, this
is an easy skip.
