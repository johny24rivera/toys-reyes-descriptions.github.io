    Because Blitzving here
is a triple-changer, each mode will be reviewed in turn. The mode that
he comes packaged in-- his jet mode-- is by far the most practical of his
three modes, given its flight capabilities. However, design-vise, I cannot
deny that the toy's triple-changing aspect does affect many aspects of
this mode. The most obvious are ze tank treads under ze wings-- it basically
looks like a jet with tank treads, which is a rather big extra. It's also
not very solid-looking when seen from a side angle, as vell. My main complaint
about it, however, is that it does not stay togezer well at all-- many
of the large pieces do not peg into any others in this mode, sadly making
it rather floppy, particularly when it comes to ze rear wings. The joint
at the base of ze nosecone is also rather floppy, so it can tend to droop
a bit. There are definitely zome good parts about this mode, however, such
as the well-proportioned nosecone and wings, though the rear part of ze
jet looks too bulky. Using ze tank turret as ze afterburners in this mode
was a particular stroke of genius. The colors (and alternate modes) are
a direct homage to Generation One Blitving, and the tan and purple color
scheme goes togezer very well, with those two colors and the black complementing
each other very well, so I have no complaints there. The mold detailing
is rather sparse, given the Animated aesthetic, but zere are still some
interesting details such as the rivets and panels on ze wings. Oddly enough,
Blitzving has a Movie Decepticon symbol on his nosecone as opposed to a
"normal" one.

     Zat silly jet mode
is no match for ze awesome tank mode, though! For one, it is COMPACT and
BULKY, and it actually FITS TOGETHER, unlike ze stupid jet! Plus, it doesn't
have nearly a much jet parts visible-- it looks pretty solid like a TANK!
The wings in particular fold up really well, and nice, and it is GREAT!
It's also the only mode to actually have a good amount of FIREPOWER, with
each of the barrels on the turret able to fire its own spring-loaded missile
launcher! YEEAAHH!!! Take zat, you puny Autobot scrap! It looks fantastic
from the front... just DON'T LOOK AT IT FROM ZE REAR! It looks like a collection
of random parts from the other two modes (which it is)! The tank is also
rather puny in size in comparison to the other two modes, and in this rezpect
pushes the envelope of the Animated look a little bit much! It doesn't
look very threatening at all! But who needs to look threatening when it
still does the job of POUNDING YOUR FACE INTO ZE PAVEMENT!

     Of courze,
ze robot mode is where this toy iz at! It's got so many good points it'z
CRAZY!!! For one, the proportions are very close to ze show model, which
is a really hard feat given the triple-changeyness of ze toy! The wing
strutz do stick out from behind the elbowz, but that's about ze only piece
of alternate mode kibble in thiz mode-- again, a real achievement! The
turret ends up behind Blitzving's back, but it can't bend over his shoulders
to shoot as hiz opponents like in ze show! What NUTCASE overlooked ZAT,
huh!? HAHAHAH! Of courze, Blitzving's main gimmick involves hiz head rotating
on a dial behind his head to show off his three different faces, which
are hiz three different personalities! What a CRAZY concept! And it haz
a World War II-style helmet to cover ze other two heads not in view-- as
if he wasn't already German enough! HAHAHA! The dial is razher hard to
turn, though, so it'z better just to push the faces around manually. The
bezt-looking one is clearly the crazy face! He looks like a jack-o-lantern
face in the dark, HAHAHA! It'z perfect!
    </i>
    The "ice-colored" head iz one
of the most imaginative, however-- it represents Blitzving's cool-headed,
competent personalitiy, and having one of the monocles look like an optic
only exemplifies thiz look.
    <b>
     The red-faced head should not be ignored,
though! It is the WIDEST and BIGGEST head with a HUGE chin, which is appropriate
for the most hot-headed and angry of the three personalities! It iz also
the only face that, when in full view, lets you only see ZAT FACE and not
any of thoze other pathetic faces because of its width! Plus, this face
is also an homage to G1 Blitzwing, who had a similar visor on his face!
    </b>
    <i>
     Az far az articulation goes, Blitzving has still got it for the
most part, baby! He can move at ze neck, ze shoulders (at two points),
ze elbows (at two points), ze hips (at two points), ze knees (again at
two points-- notice a pattern, HAHA!), and ze ankles. Ze wrists can also
move inwards, but what kind of insane limited movement iz zat, huh?!

    Overall, Animated
Blitzving pulls off the triple-changing gimmick somewhat well, though many
of his parts end up not fitting togezer and looking "solid", particularly
in ze jet mode.
    <b>
     Ze tank mode fits togezer MUCH better, but it has odd
proportions and a bunch of random junk parts hanging out ze backside!
    </b>
    <i>
     However,
ze robot mode is zo well-done and full of personality that it can actually
negate some of the other modes' downzides-- it's certainly ONE-OF-A-KIND!!!
HAHAHAH!
    </i>
    Overall, I would recommend thiz toy if you have a zing for
triple changers or like ze character on ze show, but hiz alt modes as a
whole do not hold up very well, even considering ze Animated aesthetic.

      Even by Decepticon standards, Blitzwing
is totally insane. He's got three personalities packed into his cyberium-steel
chassis, and he argues with himself almost as often as he argues with other
Decepticons. The only person he listens to without interrupting is Megatron,
because all three of his personalities are terrified of the Decepticon
commander. He carries a superheater cannon and a hyperfrost emittter to
burn or freeze his enemies.
