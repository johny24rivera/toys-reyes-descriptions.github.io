     Leobreaker's lion mode
is reasonably accurate to his larger version, with all the exquisite mold
details that come with it. Even though most of the LoC figures are by no
means underdetailed, this guy and
     <a href="locscourge.html">
      LoC Scourge
     </a>
     definitely surpass them all in these terms. The paint detailing is rather
sparse, though-- his mane, head, and shoulders have paint on them, as well
as a few spots on his underside, but his legs and lower back really need
some good paint apps. Given the smallness of the toy, however, a few sacrifices
were made, namely in the feet department-- Leobreaker's front feet are
very obviously his robot fists, with just little claw panels folded down
over them some. It's not very convincing, however. The rear feet also have
the robot heel struts molded down, which doesn't look all that hot, and
rather magnifies the fact that Leobreaker's lion mode is basically his
robot mode with laying down with a different head.

     In robot mode, Leobreaker
again stays pretty accurate to his larger version, with a few differences.
For one, the claw-blades on his lower arms don't need a Key inserted to
flip out, of course, though they don't fit as snugly over Leobreaker's
hands as you'd expect, and look odd when extended outward-- a problem that's
also noticeable in beast mode, as I mentioned. Leobreaker's tail also can't
break off to be used as a whip, which is a shame, but at this scale I can
see why such a feature was not included. I'm also not too fond of his headsculpt--
there's too many details on it to have just a silver blob of paint put
all over the lower face, as it screws up with the details and makes the
face look messy, I think. One thing I am pleasantly surprised at, however,
is that Leobreaker's legs don't look too short in comparison to the rest
of his body, something that isn't the case on the larger version, so that's
a plus. His upper arms are also bulkier than they are on the larger version,
which is a good thing for a tough guy like Leobreaker. Leobreaker can move
at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees, but keep in mind that this articulation
is little more than forward-and-back-- no side-to-side articulation there.
Leobreaker's head can move to the sides a little, but that's about it.

Leobreaker is a fairly good version of his larger brother. He has a few
problems with how his feet look in lion mode, and his his claws work in
robot mode, but that's about it, really. A decent replacement if you don't
want to pay $20 for the larger version of Leobreaker, who, in my opinion,
is a bit too simplistic for his size.
