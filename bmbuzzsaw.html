    Beast mode is a wasp.
This mode is the coolest-looking wasp beast mode I've seen, both in Beast
Wars and Beast Machines. Some of neatest features are the eyes on the head,
the dropping, but not stiff, antennae, and the neat transparent. The detailing
on this toy is pretty good for a basic, too. There are a few problems,
though. The first, and most noticeable one, is the long spring between
Buzzsaw's abdomen and stinger. Although the "stinging action" is kinda
neat for a basic, there is no locking lever, and the continual bobbing
of the stinger as you move Buzzsaw around gets a bit annoying after a while.
The second is the disturbing amount of cheap, bendy plastic on this toy.
While this type of plastic used on the antennae (and, in robot mode, the
robot head) is useful for the twitching of the antennae, the insect legs
and the green part of the stinger aren't the best place for it. The legs
tend to stay in a certain position if you leave them one way for a while,
which isn't cool if you want them to look right in both modes, and the
stinger looks less menacing if you can bend it. The third problem is that
the wings, which become the legs in the robot mode, look a bit odd in this
mode. The extra prongs on the ends of them and the large black lines at
the upper sides of them are some obvious indications that these wings become
the feet. The final problem, which may not become apparent until you see
the toy in stores, is the fact that Buzzsaw is a bit small, even for a
basic. Hasbro should at least keep the size of the basics the same if they
are going to up the price a bit, don't you think? Overall, the pros and
cons of this beast mode seem to cancel each other out, so I'm leaving final
judgement of this mode up to you.

    Robot mode looks decent,
but not the best. For one, the slagging bobbing stinger is still there,
although it has become Buzzsaw's left claw. The idea of the wings becoming
Buzzsaw's legs in robot mode was a creative one, but, in my opinion, ultimately
failed. These appendages look odd in both modes. Although Buzzsaw can surprisingly
stand up fairly well, they look too skinny, and Buzzsaw has "high heels"
in this mode, even though he's a male. :) His right arm is just two of
his insect legs, and don't really resemble anything. The only thing I can
think of is maybe you can make then some sort of lighting-guns or something.
The little piece of plastic that's supposed to hook into the rest of his
body from his right arm doesn't fit in, and it looks odd, sticking out
where it is. The robot mode head looks very nice, though, and there are
not that many extras on his back or otherwise. The spark orb is on the
inside of his stinger-claw. It's a bit hard to see, as it is the same color
as the plastic around it.

    A decent Beast Machine
toy, but not the best. Looks a bit more like a Pred than a Maximal. Mildly
recommended.

      Saved by Rattrap from the effects of
the conversion freezing virus, Buzzsaw is grateful to the Maximal cause.
Impressive aerial abilities and tendency towards gossip make him an excellent
reconnaissance scout - likes to be the buzz about town. Multi-function
stinger can pierce even the most impenetrable armor and functions as a
highly sensitive receiver/transmitter. Slightly proud, often heard referring
to himself as "the bee's knees", a statement none of his Maximal associates
can discern.
