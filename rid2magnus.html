    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

a redeco, it's nice to see some characters from

     return for the RID2015 sequel, if just in toy form. Ultra Magnus here seems
to combine the "white Prime" look with a bit more blue, but not as much
blue as Magnus has traditionally had. His main colors are white and blue,
with black used for the wheels and some of the connector parts. The blue
itself is a nice semi-metallic, fairly light shade of the color, making
the color scheme as a whole pretty light-- which of course fits Magnus.
In vehicle mode the color breakup makes the front cab section mostly white
and the back section mostly light blue. In robot mode considerably more
of the toy is blue, with only some sections of the upper legs and chest
being fully white. (It should be noted that on the upper legs and the head
swivel piece it's merely painted white, which doesn't quite match up with
the white plastic, but it's used so little on the toy it's not a huge deal.)
There's also blue paint on the shoulders, arms, and front window of the
vehicle mode (and the faux chest window on the robot mode), but they match
pretty exactly the blue plastic on the legs and head. Speaking of the head,
sadly it's not remolded so it's definitely Prime's noggin, but it's got
some white on the neck and faceplate-- it's actually kinda weird, as it's
the opposite of "white Prime's" head deco. Finally, there's a bit of dull
pale red on the legs, which helps to break up all the blue down there.
I'm glad it wasn't used elsewhere, though, to keep Magnus' deco from looking
too much like Prime's.

     RID2015 Ultra Magnus
is one of the rare redecoes of one of the main characters into a new, non-show
character, and given that there's no remolding, it's not half bad. It could've
used another paint app or two on the cab portion, but otherwise the color
scheme is pretty solid and quite Magnus-y, striking a nice balance between
Ultra Magnus' traditional more blue-shaded colors and the "white Prime
redeco" homages Magnus has also had over the years. If you like Legion
class toys, this is a fairly easy recommendation.
