    This is Movie Optimus
Prime's vehicle mode. He's had a lot of toys made of him and had a lot
of high-budget screen time, so you've no doubt become fairly familiar with
it. This version's vehicle mode doesn't have any particularly noteworthy
deviations from Movie Prime's standard proportions or colors, so I don't
really see much need to elaborate on most of the details here-- you've
heard (well, seen) them all before. There are a few minor points I have
to knock against this version's vehicle mode, though-- for one, the light
milky gray is a particularly blah shade even for that color, and a few
paint details like headlights or the flame details usually on top of the
roof are missing on this version. You can also see a LITTLE bit of the
robot legs under the rear section of the vehicle, and because of his transformation,
the halves of the cab's "nose" do tend to noticeably seperate a little
towards where they meet in front of the windows. The top of the smokestacks
are also different pieces from the bottom and, due to the transformation,
can swivel, so it can be a little difficult to get them looking "just right"
and completely aligned. Still, all of these are pretty minor complaints,
given how accurate this toy generally gets to the actual truck in terms
of proportions, the color scheme (with the really nice gold among the front
flame decals), and the like.

    Battle Blades Optimus
Prime's transformation is almost identical to
    <a href="rotfprime.html">
     RotF
Leader Class Optimus Prime's
    </a>
    , with only a surprisingly few simplifications
made for the smaller size. As such, he shares many of the same positive
and negatives of that mold-- which is to say, it's almost all positives
in this mode. The vehicle mode kibble that doesn't integrate in some essential
way to the robot mode design is almost non-existent-- simply consisting
of the folded-up tire covers behind his lower back. Pretty much everything
else is 98% movie-accurate. Being able to pull this kind of transformation
off at a Leader-class scale was an engineering feat; being able to pull
it off at a class that's half the size and price is simply jaw-dropping.
Unfortunately, like with the Leader-class toy, it comes with a price; Battle
Blades Prime is pretty darned hard to transform, particularly back into
vehicle mode. This is not one for the younger kiddies, folks, despite what
it says on the box. That aside though, because there's no electronics,
this version of Optimus Prime also has a few tricks that the Leader class
one doesn't (and visa versa, obviously, but we'll focus on the positives
here). For one, part of the lower middle section of his truck mode can
come off and flip out to become hand-held weapons, just like they were
used in the movie (though neither of them fire any actual missiles on this
toy). He also has a Matrix of Leadership with incredibly finely-sculpted
detail inside his chest. Just like with the RotF Leader-class toy, he also
has flip-out swords in this mode, though you have to manually flip them
out yourself. They're also made of that rubbery type of plastic for safety
purposes, what with the smaller scale and whatnot. Honestly though, they
can get in the way a bit, particularly during transformation. I would've
slightly preferred if they had forgone that little feature. As for articulation,
Prime's got it in spades; he can move at the neck, shoulders (at four points),
elbows (at two points), hips (at three points), knees (at two points),
and ankles (at two points), so he can get into a TON of awesome poses,
and he's quite stable, too.

    Battle Blades Optimus
Prime is an incredibly-engineered design, particularly at this scale--
he has great proportions in both modes, great screen accuracy, great mold
detailing, great articulation, great features (for the most part)-- just
about great everything, really. He's quite difficult to transform, so I
wouldn't recommend this toy to younger or less patient Transfans, but if
you like complex transformations and don't want a super-big or expensive
Movie Prime toy, this one's your guy.

      Optimus Prime isn't famous for being
a particularly skilled fighter-- he relies mostly on raw power to secure
victory. Unfortunately for Decepticon Banzaitron, all that raw power actually
masks decades of training. Optimus Prime is one of the most accomplished
fighters ever produced by Cybertron. He may not be as flashy as the Decepticon
martial arts master, but he's got more than enough skill to crush Decepticon
Banzaitron.
