    Given that he doesn't
ever transform into a vehicle in the movie, Shockwave's alt mode is sort
of... made up based off of his robot mode design. Sort of like
    <a href="rotffallen.html">
     The
Fallen
    </a>
    , though at least a BIT more recognizable than that guy's in
that this is definitely a tank of some sort. An alien tank with an off-center
turret, but still definitely a tank. The treads-- particularly on the rear--
are incredibly well-detailed and really help to sell at least part of the
"tank" aspect of him, and the little bone-like notches at the very front
with little wheels help to make it a bit more recognizable as a vehicle,
even if an alien one. I really don't like how off-center the turret is,
though (so done because it attaches to one of his robot mode arms), and
said turret can't rotate at all-- it can only fire forward. That said,
you can push forward on the back end of the turret (also Shockwave's Mechtech
weapon) to have two side cannons open up, and-- in a true rarity for Mechtech
weapons-- you can actually
    <i>
     lock
    </i>
    it in its "open" phase by sticking
the button into a little tab alcove, so it's a VERY nifty weapon. The blade
on the other side of the tank, not so much-- how well is a blade on the
back end going to be used in tank mode? Both the gun and blade help to
hide all the robot parts that sort of collapse into the middle of this
mode, but not very well-- it's still very obvious this is Shockwave's secondary
mode, as you can fairly easily pick out chest in the middle, the arms on
the back top, and the bottoms of the feet don't mesh very well with the
treads they cover on Shockwave's front section. There's also no real back
end to this mode-- it's almost completely hollow. The hose, which has almost
always been a feature of Shockwave's, is unfortunately rather annoying
here, looking rather odd at most of the points you can attach it here (and,
if you want to keep it in the same place for robot mode as I did above,
the two points where it attaches are WAY too close to each other, making
the hose look too long). The hose also has a bad tendency to come off at
one end a little too easily-- honestly, even with it being one of Shockwave's
signature "bits", the toy would've been better without this piece. As far
as the color scheme goes, it looks better than you think purple and gray
would-- both are slightly metallic shades of the color, and neither look
boring. The bronze, light metallic purple, and gunmetal gray bits help
to diversify his colors up a bit as well.

    Shockwave's robot mode
is very, very close to his movie model, and is definitely where the lion's
share of the design effort went into this toy. Proportionally, he's very
close to being movie-accurate-- his chest is just a tad wide and his arms
a little short, but those are fairly minor quibbles overall. All of the
detailing on Shockwave-- both paint-wise and mold-wise-- is incredible,
and just really brings out how evil and skeletal-like this warrior is.
From his skeletal "rib cage" in the middle of his chest to his incredibly
scary headsculpt which NAILS how he looks in the movie (and with fantastic
light piping for the eye, too!), everything just comes together so well
in this mode. He has an unusually large number of paint apps for a DotM
toy, as well, with the light metallic purple and gunmetal especially helping
to make him look semi-metallic overall, particularly in the chest and legs.
I do wish his light purple bits weren't quite as "milky" of a color, but
that color isn't used much anyways. His articulation is quite good-- he
can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows, at the base
of each wrist, and at the hips (at three points) and knees (at two points).
Because of his transformation he doesn't have a waist joint, but other
than that and some minor foot limitations you can get a great number of
poses out of him, particularly since he's so well-balanced. As for weapons,
on one of his lower arms you can attach his blade-like weapon while on
the other you can flip up his hand and attach his cannon (with its hose
attached to his back as well).

    DotM Shockwave has an
excellent robot mode, but his vehicle mode is only slightly more recognizable
as a vehicle than most of the other movieverse toys with "Cybertronian
alt modes"-- i.e., it's definitely Shockwave's robot mode merely folded
into a tank-like shape. His hose is also rather annoying and ill-conceived
as well. If you are a Shockwave fan or just want to keep him in robot mode,
this is a definite pick up-- otherwise, there are several better mainline
DotM designs out there.

      Few have ever seen Shockwave and lived.
This is the hand that ensures Decepticon plans remain secret from the Autobots.
He eliminates evidence and witnesses with brutal, emotionless efficiency.
The only hints he ever leaves of his presence are smoking craters and the
collapsed tunnels through which he travels.
