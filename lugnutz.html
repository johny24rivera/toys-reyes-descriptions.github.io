    Lugnutz' vehicle mode
is a very realistic motorcycle-- nearly Alternators-esque in its realistic
actually. It's quite impressive for such a small figure. All the necessary
details, such as exhaust pipes, vents, handlebars with brakes, and even
a license plate on the back end with a Decepticon symbol are all present
and accounted for. The color scheme of orange, black, and gray isn't the
most eye-catching or exciting, but it is certainly a realistic color combo
(which is the Earth planet's general theme in this line, anyways) and doesn't
clash. Lugnutz also has a decent amount of paint apps-- I especially like
the gold flame apps on some of the orange parts, though the gold could
stand to be a bit brighter to contrast with the orange a little more. I
also like that a few of the paint apps, such as the dull blue used for
the headlight, are only used in one place, as it gives the impression that
more care went into Lugnutz' color choices. As for his Cyber Key gimmick,
Lugnutz' is really simple, but non-intrusive and effective-- insert the
Cyber Key into its slot in the rear of this mode, and a (non-firing) missile
rack pops up to take out some Autobots!

    As for his robot mode,
well... few Transformers have such a contrast in quality between their
different modes as Lugnutz does. Simply put, Lugnutz' robot mode is absolutely
horrible. A few things are okay, such as the "core" robot proportions if
you don't include the kibble, and the color and paint detailing, are still
okay, but other than that this mode could use a LOT of work. For one, Lugnutz
practically has two-thirds of his alt mode hanging off his back. And unlike
most Cybertron toys, it's not incorporated well into the robot mode at
all, and just sort of hangs there. The motorcycle wheel-halves are especially
annoying and intrusive, as they're not connected to the backpack itself,
but rather the shoulders, which means they get in the way of articulation
a LOT. What's worse, only two very small tabs are holding the entire backpack
to the main robot body, so needless to say, it doesn't hold together all
that well. A little casual fiddling with the upper body and the backpack
comes unhooked-- very annoying. Lugnutz' robot head is a bit too far in
his chest, as well-- I would have preferred an actual bonafied head rather
than just a "peekaboo" head that flips up from part of the motorcycle.
There's also a sizable, very noticeable gap in the side of Lugnutz' main
body, as a result of his transformation. It's rather unsightly. Another
downside is that Lugnutz' arms aren't long enough to hold his gun properly--
he has to hold his gun at a slight angle if you want the elbows bent at
all. And finally, although Lugnutz' articulation is pretty fair-- he can
move at the shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips-- his arm articulation is
horribly limited because of the kibble on his shoulders and his backpack,
and his stability is also adversely affected by how back-heavy he is.

    Lugnutz is one of the
poorest basics of the Cybertron line. Don't be fooled by how great his
vehicle mode looks inside the card, his robot mode is simply a pile of
haphazard junk-- this toy should have spent much more time on the drawing
board before being finalized. Not recommended unless you're a completist
or just like the character (like me).

      A loner, a renegade and a rebel. His
only true friend is his assault rifle, "Dutch." He much prefers cruising
the dusty back roads of Earth, doing crimes and terrorizing the populace
to running missions for Megatron, but if it means a chance to blow something
up he's willing to swallow his pride and take a job. A powerful dual-stroke
engine and specialized exhaust filters allow him to generate enough engine
noise to overwhelm Autobot audio receptors and shatter reinforced glass
in a 100 foot radius.
