    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Stealth Bumblebee-- because
two mainline Legends-class Bumblebees in the same line aren't enough! All
kidding aside, the re-using of the "reverse" color scheme for Bumblebee
is one of the better schemes to re-use. I'm a sucker for black-dominated
color schemes, as there aren't many colors that clash with black. Yellow
isn't one of those, and works as a very nice contrast color-- particularly
in vehicle mode. It's not simply a pallet swap, however-- the stripes have
added little borders, which help Stealth Bumblebee look a bit more interesting.
However, the shade of yellow used on the piece that folds up behind his
back and lower legs in robot mode is slightly "yellower" than the orangish-yellow
on the piece that forms his chest in robot mode. I have no idea why this
was done, but it does look a little odd in vehicle mode. The slightly darker
metallic silvery blue used for the windows works well with the overall
darker color scheme. In robot mode, Bumblebee has a particularly nice shade
of metallic silver used on his paint apps, and they contrast pretty darn
well with the black. The amount of paint detailing on his face-- given
how small it is-- is also pretty impressive; not only is his face painted
silver, but his teeny tiny eyes are also painted the metallic silvery blue
color used for his windows, and to top it all off he's got a nice metallic
bronze Autobot symbol on his tiny forehead.

     RotF Stealth Bumblebee
may not be the most original idea for a redeco in the world, but it's still
a great color scheme and there's some nice paint detailing on this toy,
like the extra borders on the stripes and the little paint details on his
face. Not sure why the paint for his stripes is two slightly different
colors, but still-- definitely the version of this mold I'd recommend the
most.
