    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Power of the Primes Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of PotP Starscream

     Elita-1 is such an extensive
remold of PotP Starscream, it's basically easier to list what ISN'T a remold
of Starscream-- which, beyond her Prime Armor parts and jet nosecone, is
basically just minor connector parts. The transformation is shared, as
well. First off, her wings are completely different, having longer "intake"
vents at the end of each wing and with large holes in them, making her
look a bit lighter and more aerodynamic than Starscream. However, as much
as I despise foil stickers, I REALLY despise them here, as they cover much
of the top front two-thirds of her jet mode with shiny pink stickers that
blare back at you if you've got even a bit of light against them, blinding
out many of those simple mechanical details on the stickers. It really
looks bad against the rest of her jet mode. The tailfins are also more
angular, with the top portions having small bits that actually point forward,
almost looking like she's got little guns up there. All of this, combined
with the more segmented detailing on the top rear section of this mode,
makes Elita-1's jet mode a bit more alien than Starscream's. In Elita-1's
robot mode, of course she has a new headsculpt-- which is spot-on Elita-1
from the G1 cartoon, complete with a rather complicated helmet with two
minor antennae sticking out of the sides diagonally, a yellow bit across
her soft pink forehead, and a white "normal" face with light sky blue eyes.
Compared to Starscream, Elita's shoulders and hands are a bit smaller (and
the former have Autobot allegiance symbol foil stickers on them), though
the lower arms are still as abnormally chunky and odd as ever. They've
got nifty ridged white designs on the back of them this time, though, so
there's that. In place of Starscream's larger null rays, Elita-1 has much
smaller blasters-- you could almost call them "pea shooters"-- that can
fit in the same places, either in the middle of her upper arms or held
in her fists. Her chest is more feminine than Starscream's-- no faux jet
mode chest here, just a curvier body with red sides, a white stomach, and
soft pink on the upper chest. Given her chunky proportions because of her
transformation, though, the chest sticks out too much, looking a bit odd.
Her legs are a bit more slender-looking, but still pretty oversized given
her design. She's got slimmer upper legs, with skinnier, more angular designs
on her lower legs. Her feet look like the front portion of high heels,
but given how the back of the lower legs is designed she doesn't get the
rear portion of those high heels. As for the torso mode's head (either
Elita-Infin1te or Orthia, depending upon who you want to combine her with),
it basically looks like a larger version of her normal head, but with longer,
more apparent diagonal antennae and a more obvious central headcrest, complete
with a center vent on the top and three small circular details on her yellow
forehead-bar. It's decent, but for a combiner head I would've wanted something
a bit more unique.

     As for Elita-1's color
scheme, she does have some soft pink plastic on her head, chest, upper
arms, and on some minor connector parts, but largely her traditionally
pink-and-white scheme is now dark red-and-white. Personally I think this
looks better, not being a big fan of pink, and it was also probably done
to make her more palatable to a predominantly male audience at a Voyager
pricepoint, as well. The red and white go together quite nicely, though
the colors are broken up a bit better in robot mode than in vehicle mode.
For another dark color, there's some dark gray on her shoulders and lower
legs, which "bleeds through" to the top end of her jet mode too, though
having those rear sections being half-gray and half-dark-red looks a bit
odd. There's also some nice dark metallic blue on her cockpit windows--
a quite nice shade, I wish it was used more often. There's some small pink-and-dark-gray
paint apps on the sides of her lower legs, and some pretty cool cybernetic
"E1" signs on her tailfins, with "Elita One-- Autobot" in smaller text
underneath them, in case you didn't get the reference. Beyond the foil
stickers I've already talked about, she has silver "Elita-1" stickers on
the sides of her nosecone, and some more pink/red foil stickers on the
pieces that are next to her nosecone, as well as next to her rear thrusters
and small stickers on her lower arms. In other words, WAY TOO MANY foil
stickers! For a couple of small details I guess I don't mind them that
much, but used this much they just look bad on an otherwise painted, modern
toy. Black is used on her Prime Armor pieces, but nowhere else. Finally,
there's a bit of yellow spray on the small "Matrix-like" power-up piece
that you can stick in either of her Prime Armor pieces or in her chest
in combined mode.

     Instead of redecoing
PotP Starscream into yet another Seeker redeco, PotP Elita-1 was a nice,
more original remold of the toy, with a fairly solid color scheme that
takes her G1 scheme and makes it a bit redder, adding some more interesting
shades to the mix and some nice mold changes. However, unless you're a
big fan of the character or must have an all-female combiner composed of
already existing characters (i.e., not
     <a href="victorion.html">
      Victorion
     </a>
     ),
I still wouldn't recommend this toy, because of all the mold flaws discussed
in the Starscream review (that is, very odd 'bot proportions and a TON
of unsightly kibble in vehicle mode) and because the foil stickers are
especially obnoxious on this toy. Still, she's slightly better than Starscream
overall.
