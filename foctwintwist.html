    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Brawl.

     Just as with the other
FoC Ruination components, Twintwist here is a double homage-- both to the
G1 character of the same name, and to the Ruination component from the
2001
     <i>

     ,
whose toy had a similar color scheme to this Twintwist's. The dull, slightly
arctic-feeling blue isn't a particularly exciting color, though with the
exception of the turret (which has no paint apps on it whatsoever), it's
usually complemented by enough other colors to keep it from looking too
boring. Like with his other Wrecker teammates, Twintwist has a large amount
of dark milky brownish gray as a nice "neutral" color for his other colors
to play off of, though I wish it was a bit more metallic of a shade to
bring a bit more visual interest to Twintwist in vehicle mode. There's
also a bit of that blah light milky gray, though it's only used on a few
parts like his drills, and thus doesn't bug me that much. The paint apps
look quite good against Twintwist's main colors, however-- the light orange
really pops, is used enough to make his color scheme interesting in robot
mode, and ties him in thematically with his teammates as well. The silver
and metallic gunmetal gray look decent enough as well, though the bits
of light blue on the front of his vehicle mode, his thrusters, his abs,
and his eyes really complement the duller blue quite well, to the point
where I wish it was used a bit more often.

     Twintwist has two mold
changes. The first is a new robot head, which mimics his G1 headsculpt,
albeit in different colors because of his overall dual-homage. It's a very
good headsculpt, though the neutral expression on it doesn't fit the psychopathic
'bot that's described in his bio. The biggest mold change, however, is
a new, dual-drill weapon that helps give him his name and is a throwback
to his G1 toy. By pressing down on the light gray gun sticking up from
the back end, the drills will spin a bit-- pretty nifty, though I wish
the whole ensemble fit over his dual tank guns in vehicle mode to effectively
make him the futuristic mining vehicle he was in G1. There's also storage
near the back of this weapon for Brawl's small gun, which Twintwist also
comes with. I wish the connection port wasn't so long for this weapon--
it always wiggles a bit in vehicle mode, and it's really only held in by
gravity there (turn Twintwist upside down in that mode, and it falls right
out.)

     Twintwist is a decent
enough color scheme-- and, thank goodness, this mold's not another variant
of green this time! However, a few more brighter colors in vehicle mode
really could've made it pop more there, and the dual homage thing doesn't
work that well on Twintwist. Without any significant amount of white on
him and the inability for his drill weapon to slide over his tank guns,
it ends up not bringing to mind Twintist all that much. Obviously if you
want combining Wreckers, he's your only option, but as a new "updated"
Twintwist this remold falls a fair bit short.

       No one's really sure why Twintwist joined
up with the Autobots instead of the Decepticons. He's a barely contained
ball of rage that lives for chaos and destruction. In battle, he engages
the enemy without mercy. Back at base, he sulks, argues, and occasionally
goes on a rampage and destroys things for no reason.
