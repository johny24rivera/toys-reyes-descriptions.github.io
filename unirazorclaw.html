    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Tigerhawk. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Tigerhawk

     What's that you say?
They've taken one of my favorite Beast Transformer molds of all time- Tigerhawk-
and given it one of my favorite color schemes of all time, black and purple
with some silver? I'm sooo there! As you can probably guess, I am absolutely
ecstatic about this toy. This toy is LUV. The black and purple mesh together
very well- and the transmetal plastic is gone, too, so you don't have to
worry about that chipping anymore. The red and silver are also nice contrasts,
and the green eyes certainly look menacing. About the only thing I would
have to say is disspointing about this toy is the "energon radiation" patterns-
there's just a couple of small streaks of silver on the wings, and that's
it. Not nearly as cool-looking as most of the other radiation patterns.
Oh, and he still has the Maximal symbol on his chest, even though he's
a Decepticon now- wouldn't have been that hard to remold that small portion
of him. Whassupwidat? Razorclaw could also still use a few more paint apps
on his legs in robot mode, but he's still awesomely awesome.

     Razorclaw actually has
a mold change done- no more annoying firing wing missiles, thank you oodles,
Hasbro! Yep, his missiles do not automatically fire when the wings are
put down to their lowest position, thank Primus. That was SO annoying,
glad to see that fixed. The launchers still flip forward, though, but that's
not nearly as bad.

     You've got nothing to
lose with Razorclaw- a spectacular mold and a spectacular color scheme.
What more could you ask for?

       Know that he is Razorclaw, that his
reality is not yours, and while he may resemble Tigerhawk, Razorclaw is
not he! This alternate version of Tigerhawk was corrupted by the Vok, and
he killed his universe's Megatron. Unicron, his body ruined and trapped
between dimensions, abducted Razorclaw to be his fourth and final general.
Razorclaw has served his new master well, pillaging star systems with all
of his Vok-enhanced elemental powers. He harbors a special hatred for Optimus
Primal, his former commander, whose ideals represent everything that Razorclaw
has left behind. His spark is binaryÂ—it consists of the sparks of his home
universe's Airazor and Tigatron. Time will tell if their noble influence
can push to the surface.
