    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Saesee Tiin

     Obi-Wan's color scheme
used for this mold catches the eye a lot better than Saesee Tiin's, with
a great mix of dark red and a mix of off-white, black, and dull yellow
used for secondary colors. It's an incredibly unique color scheme, and
all of the color contrast extremely well with each other. (Well, not so
much for the pale yellowish-white against the pale off-white, but that's
only in a few places in Mech mode). The particular mix of the colors is
also a bit different in each mode, with the alt mode being more red and
the Mech mode more yellow/white, which helps to differentiate the modes
a bit. Plus, there's tons of cool paint apps designs all over Obi-Wan,
all of which add to the toy's appeal quite a bit.

     As with most SWTF mold
re-uses, Obi-Wan Kenobi has a different head than the mold's previous use
as Saesee Tiin. This version of Obi-Wan has another robotic representation
of the character's head for its' Mech mode head, though this one looks
substantially better in its overall look than the overly square and small
Obi-Wan head used on the
     <a href="obiwan.html">
      Episode I Starfighter mold
     </a>
     ,
in my opinion. (Still not too crazy about the mecha-facial hair, though.)
In addition, a miniature Obi-Wan figurine is included with the toy instead
of a miniature Saesee Tiin figure.

     Obi-Wan Kenobi is an
awesome-colored remold of the Episode II Starfighter mold. The mold itself
has quite a bit of kibble and is only average as far as the SWTFs go, but
this is definitely as good as the mold's going to look. Recommended over
Saesee Tiin.

       Obi-Wan Kenobi pilots his Jedi Starfighter
into the battle on Geonosis. The Republics Jedi Knights and clone troopers
are fighting a huge army of battle droids that have been created by the
Separatists. The droids are powerful, but they are no match for Obi-Wans
secret weapon: his fighter can convert into a robotic Jedi warrior that
can single-handedly take on legions of droids!
