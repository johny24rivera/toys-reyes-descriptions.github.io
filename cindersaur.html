    NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars 10th Anniversary
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars

     Hooboy, now THIS guy
is an obscure homage. Cindersaur, in G1, was one of three Firecons, in
addition to Sparkstalker and Flamefeather. The latter two Firecons got
re-released in G2 in Europe only; both of them had purple and light green
as main colors in their robot modes, while their beast modes were either
transparent yellow or transparent red. Cindersaur's original mold was never
re-released in G2, unlike his Firecon brethren, so now he gets a sorta
G2 toy himself! Granted, he was a monster in the original, not a dinosaur,
but given the "saur" part of his name, using a toy with a t-rex alt mode
isn't too far off the mark.

     Anyways, blue works
surprisingly well for a dinosaur-- particularly this nice shade of moderately
light blue-- sorta like some sky-dino or something. And the transparent
blue parts really help to make the toy a bit more stand-out, given the
lack of a new mold or anything of the sort. The light red and silver both
go extraordinarily well with the blue. In robot mode, the purple and light
green are more apparent and give Cindersaur an appropriate "lizard-esque"
color scheme-- but they also blend in quite well with the blue in a fruity
(but NOT "so-bad-its-good) kind of way. All of the right details painted,
it all works together surprisingly well. I don't like the dull light gray--
it's way too overused and just looks bad-- but it's only used in very small
amounts, so that's a pretty minor complaint.

     No mold changes have
been made to Cindersaur, though the Cyber Key has been changed to the standard
Decepticon Cyber Key with the G2 Decepticon symbol painted on the front.

     Cindersaur is a pretty
darn imaginative homage, and though he has loud colors, unlike many of
the other updated G2 characters in this years' set, I think they actually
work together really well even ignoring the "kitsch" factor, and is in
fact my favorite of the color schemes this mold has been released in--
not to mention color-wise my favorite toy of the Botcon 2010 exclusives.
Still, he is admittedly a bit of a stretch when it comes to looking like
Cindersaur, given the head that's so obviously a differently-colored Megatron
and the different alt mode, but I still think he looks pretty darned cool.

       There is no nuance within the mind of
Firecon Cindersaur. He is a simple creature whose whole purpose of existence
is focused on the destruction of anything around him. This is not cruelty
or some perverse enjoyment; to Cindersaur it is pure instinct to destroy
and that is what he does best. His fusion powered flame breath can be used
in both narrow and wide streams. His recent forestonite fueled upgrade
has made this weapon more powerful. The constant stream of energy leaking
from his joints causes him to leave a path of destruction everywhere he
walks. A curious side effect of this energy leak is that he no longer needs
to take baths in lava, as he was once so fond of, in order to soothe his
aching joints. This has made Cindersaur both a faster and more efficient
engine of destruction, but no more intelligent than before.
