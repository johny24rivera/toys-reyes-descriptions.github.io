    The first character to
be made in the 6" Titanium line that didn't have some version of a toy
beforehand, The Fallen is one of the original 13 Transformers, so called
because he turned against Primus and sided with Unicron. In the comic miniseries
    <b>
     The
War Within: The Dark Ages
    </b>
    , in which he starred, he was nearly invincible
and was always on fire (but without actually burning up, of course). It's
nice to see such an incredibly evil character get made into a toy, at long
last.

    That said, The Fallen's
toy isn't quite the same as his design in the comics-- it's been modified
a bit so it can work as a toy at this scale, but it's still undeniably
The Fallen. He still keeps his futuristic tank mode, though it's been heavily
modified. It still looks very good, however, if a bit more simplstic. The
proportions are pretty good all around, and although the mold detailing
is just a tad sparser than what I'd consider ideal, it's still definitely
adequate, with stuff like "worn metal scars" and "rivets" here and there
on his form. I especially like that gatling guns were molded into the front
of his treads, they help give this all-powerful Transformer even more firepower.
His overall color scheme in this mode of black and a bit of gunmetal gray
is rather bland by most Transformers' standards, but it works well on The
Fallen, especially in robot mode (which is why I wish more "flame-y" color
paint apps were visible in this mode. There is one major flaw with this
mode, however, and that's that the back thirds of the treads don't peg
in to the front two thirds of the treads-- or any other surrounding parts--
at all, and just kind of flop around. That was a major oversight, and really
the only thing stopping The Fallen from being tied with the War Within
Seeker mold for the best Titanium to date. Another, more minor, downside
to this mode is that it's a bit too obvious that his arms form the front
part of the turret, even if they fit in fairly well with the overall shape
of the mode. The back of the robot head on the rear of the turret is also
a tad obvious. The hands on the very front are the only robot parts that
absolutely stick out like sore thumbs, however. One last interesting thing
about this mode is that The Fallen has his "allegiance" symbol on the rear
part of his right tread, which is actually just a simplified icon of his
face. It still certainly looks cool, though, and adding this brand-new
symbol to his display base is just icing on the cake.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    One thing that's immediately
apparent when you look at The Fallen's robot mode is just how eeeevil he
is. I mean, he's the evilest evil to ever evil the evil. Here's where all
that black really pays off-- the orange "vents" in his legs and chest look
INCREDIBLY awesome against the black, especially since the very edges of
the orange "vents" are a duller color than the center portions, making
it look like The Fallen is glowing to a certain extent. I also like the
flame paint apps on his tank treads hanging above his back-- not only does
it double the impression that he's a thing of evil, it also helps make
his tank treads look less like kibble, as well. His face looks like a worn
knight's mask, with metal scars all over the place and, of course, glowing
orang eyes. EVIL, I tell you! He's also pretty big for a 6" Titanium--
not that I'm complaining. It's certainly appropriate for a big baddie such
as himself. The Fallen also has excellent articulation, especially for
a Titanium-- he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), waist, hips (at two points), and knees (at two points),
though he can't bend his knees back all the way. And, given his wide feet,
that means you can get quite a few poses out of him. For weapons, The Fallen's
turret guns can either be left on the backs of his forearms or instead
pegged into the holes in his fists. There are a few, fairly minor, flaws
in this mode, though. The first is about the aforementioned hands-- they
look far too square and un-hand-like, though this was probably done to
help them look less obvious in tank mode. (Too bad it didn't work that
well.) Also, the rear third of the tank treads (darn them!), which fold
behind the front two-thirds of the treads directly behind The Fallen's
upper back, don't stay in their folded-up position all that well. You're
supposed to be able to push them in a little to stabilize them a bit in
this mode, but it doesn't work as well as it's supposed to. Oh, and in
case you're wondering, The Fallen's diecast parts are his lower legs, his
chest, and his shoulders.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The Fallen is an excellent
Titanium toy, with an incredibly evil, unique look in both modes. THIS,
my friends, is what the Titanium line is all about! The only real flaws
he has mostly have to deal with his overly floppy back-third tank treads
pieces. Highly recommended.

      War Within Fallen forgot his real name
long ago. It didn't matter. It was a name given to him by his creator -
the one he betrayed. It was a relic of the time before he had some to see
the truth. The truth of Unicron.

      Created as one of the original 13 Transformers
to serve as a protector of Cybertron, Fallen has always been a creature
of chaos and degradation. His original purpose was to oversee the stately
running down of the universal clock, the ordered tick of universal balance
from energy to entropy, the slow and total collapse that heralds a new
creation - for what are creation and life without dissolution and death?
He knew his purpose only too well, and became obsessed with the end of
all things. Intrigued by the dark sciences, he came in contact with Unicron,
and fell under the evil planet's thrall.

      He exists now for one purpose alone:
the destruction of the Seal of Primus and the release of Unicron into the
universe. He lives only so that one day he might witness the last star
in the universe wink out, and eternal ending fall.
