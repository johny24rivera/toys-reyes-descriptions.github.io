    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Class I Episode III Starfighter
Anakin Skywalker. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Class

     Well, things have finally
come full circle. The
     <a href="obiwan.html">
      "Class II" Obi-Wan Kenobi
     </a>
     from the Episode III Starfighter was in the very first wave of Star Wars
Transformers, so I suppose it's only fitting that we get a smaller version
of that design for what would be the last wave of Star Wars Transformers
(at least as of this review, 9/14). Obi-Wan keeps his primarily dark flat
red paint apps that his various Starfighters have had for a while now in
vehicle mode, and they contrast with the gray and silver paint just as
well as they ever have (i.e., pretty well). The gray plastic-- normally
a rather boring color-- has a bit of a metallic swirl to it, and a fair
amount of it is painted silver too, so even the "boring" color looks decent
on this toy. The black-and-white paint apps underneath the fold-out wing
sections also look really great, adding more to the look than you'd think.
In mech mode, Obi-Wan's color scheme has been changed a bit to ape his
usual outfit, so his "mech-only" parts are either light pale orange, light
tan, or a paleish yellow. The sheer number of paint apps and how they all
come together is impressive even for a Star Wars Transformer here, and
the bits of copper, dark red, and brown plastic on his arm-wings and lower
legs help to enhance the color scheme even more.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Obi-Wan-- beyond the usual headsculpt change.
Compared to most other SWTFs, this sculpt of Obi-Wan's face is more robotic-looking
and angled (particularly with the "hair" detailing), which I'm all for.
The metallic copper looks great against the silver face and light blue
eyes, as well.

     This latest version
of Obi-Wan Kenobi as a Episode III Starfighter is the best color scheme
he's had on this alt mode, with a few extra paint apps added to the usual
dull-red-and-gray color scheme not only in vehicle mode (the black and
white under the wings), but to his mech mode colors as well, which are
simply magnificent. The brown-orange-tan-yellow mix complements the mode
very well, even ignoring that they're suppose to mimic his clothes. Recommended
over the Anakin version of this mold, though I think the
     <a href="cl1vader.html">

     </a>
     version slightly edges him out, and the mold design itself is admittedly
medicore.
