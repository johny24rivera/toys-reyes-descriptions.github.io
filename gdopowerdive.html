    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Highbrow.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Highbrow

     Powerdive here is a bit
of an obscure one-- he's an homage to the Generation 2 "Rotor Force" toy
of the same name, although his alt mode is more reminiscent of fellow Decepticon
G2 Rotor Force toy Ransack. (On this note, I'm mildly sad he doesn't have
G2 Decepticon symbols.) Anyways, his general color scheme is definitely
evocative of G2 Powerdive's with a bit more milky gray and a bit less purple.
Personally, I would've preferred it a bit more slavish to his original
colors-- making the toy mostly dark green and milky gray does make it a
bit similar in the general color palette to this mold's original use as
Highbrow. I'm also just not as fond of light milky gray plastic-- we'd
got enough of that boring-looking stuff on TFs already, and the purple
is a really nice shade against the dark green. These three colors by far
make up the most "real estate" as far as Powerdive's color scheme goes,
but he's got plenty of paint apps of different colors. My favorite is the
"shark head" paint app he's got around the cockpit, which looks really
nice, gives a bit of a "light spot" to his otherwise dark-colored vehicle
mode, and really fits in with the WWII feel of the vehicle. He's also got
the "DC&gt;" emblems around his central engine just like on the G2 toy, which
add a bit more individuality as well. He's got a silver nosecone and engines,
dull red propellers, a light red cockpit, some tan "connector pieces" in
robot mode, and a nice dark metallic gunmetal gray on his stomach and below
his cockpit area-- all of which go great with their surrounding colors,
and which I have absolutely no issues with. The only color on Powerdive
I wish was tweaked is the light gold on a few parts like his hips and some
minor detailing behind his propellers-- it has a bit of a greenish hue
to it, which looks a little ugly, honestly.

     Powerdive does have
one mold change- he's got a new headsculpt, with light red eyes (with excellent
light piping), a long, angular faceplate that looks pretty unique, sort
of like a big long chin-- and a flip-down "flight helmet", just like Highbrow
has. It's all molded and painted rather well, though it's actually evocative
of G2 Ransack's headsculpt moreso than G2 Powerdive's-- another indication
that this was likely intended to be Ransack initially and some miscommunication
in the pipeline made the toy Powerdive, instead. It's not that big of an
issue, though-- neither of them had particularly memorable headsculpts,
given how little (if any) fiction they've been in, so it still looks adequately
Decepticon-ish.

     "GDO" Powerdive is a
pretty nice redeco, homaging an obscure character that isn't likely to
get another toy any time soon (if ever)-- even if some of the cues make
it clear this was initially intended to be a new Ransack, and palette-wise
Powerdive looks a bit too much like Highbrow under dark lighting. He's
got a ton of great paint apps, though, and is generally just a great toy
all-around. Recommended; mildly so if you already have Highbrow.

       Powerdive doesn't mess around trying
to be sneaky. As soon as he detects an Autobot he puts himself into a screaming
dive directly at the enemy's position. He doesn't care if his target hears
him coming-- by the time anyone can react, Powerdive will have destroyed
his prey and rocketed back up into the sky.
