    Pterodactyl alt modes
on TFs are almost universally awkward in some respect, but the 1-step changer
of AoE Strafe pretty much takes the cake for the most awkward. It... it
looks like a little dwarf robot with barely any legs and two pterodactyl
heads with overly small wings in the back. Because that's exactly what
it is; the robot mode, with the legs bent backwards at the knee and the
robot head tucked in while the two pterodactyl heads are sticking out from
the shoulders and more prominent. The wings are of a pretty good size on
the other AoE Strafe toys, but not here; they're long enough, but not nearly
deep enough, to the point where it's hard to see this monstrosity flying
anywhere on such skinny wings. You can't tilt the feet forward, so Strafe
is stuck in the incredibly awkward pose pictured above unless you literally
just lay him on his stomach... but then the robot feet on his back stick
out like a sore thumb (from most front angles in this mode, the lower legs
at least stay close enough to the back of the body where they're not easily
viewable). There's also the very noticeable matter of the robot arms just
hanging off the sides of the main body in this mode, like they're the pterodactyl's
regular arms-- super weird. The top third or so of the robot head is also
obvious in between the two pterodactyl heads. On the plus side, the color
scheme for Strafe is kept more similar to his
    <a href="aoestrafe.html">

    </a>
    than his lighter-colored
    <a href="aoepbstrafe.html">
     Power Battler
    </a>
    version-- which I'm glad about, as the dark blue and black go better together
and contrast against the silver paint app on the chest pretty well. That
said, Strafe really needs some more silver paint apps, particularly on
his wings and/or arms to give him a little less "dark", light blue eyes
or no. The mold detailing is also nearly on par with his other figures,
with rather intricate, armor plating-like detailing on most of the figure,
though the wings could use a little more of it. For articulation in this
mode, Strafe can move back-and-forth at his *ahem* arms that are actually
the robot arms, as well as up-and-down at the base of his two tails (as
one piece) and forward-and-back at two separate places along his wings.
Unfortunately, if you actually try to flap his wings up and down, this
initiates the transformation, which I find pretty stupid. Why tie the transformation
to such an important point of movement? Tie it to the robot legs or pterodactyl
heads or something else you don't normally move instead.

    All this said, at least
the robot mode looks pretty good and proportional all around, particularly
for a 1-step changer. The pterodactyl heads collapse onto the shoulders
and chest in a fashion that gets in the way of the head and chest at certain
angles, but otherwise this is a pretty solid mode-- all the proportions
are pretty right-on, and although the smaller wings don't work in pterodactyl
mode, in robot mode they work as an excellent "cape" of sorts. Strafe's
headsculpt is done quite well with a nice blazing light blue optic paint
app in the center, and the mold detailing on the lower legs is quite accurate,
with the appropriate Dinobot "knight shoes". As far as the rest of him
goes, so much is shared between both modes I don't really have much else
to say about this mode. In addition to the aforementioned articulation
in pterodactyl mode, you can also move Strafe's legs backwards at the knees
one or two clicks (they're on a gear assembly that automatically folds
them out when the wings swing down), which is a nice extra little touch
but I wish didn't come with the slight risk of messing up the auto-transformation
gears, so I prefer to just keep them straight down as in the pic above.

    AoE 1-step changer Strafe's
robot mode looks pretty good and proportional, particularly for this gimmicked
subline, but his pterodactyl mode is simply awful-- even for a TF pterodactyl,
and that's saying something. Far too much of the robot mode is visible
in that mode, and honestly this toy didn't need to be produced. The deluxe
Strafe is only slightly more complicated to transform, and has far more
articulation and better proportions in both modes. Not really recommended
for anyone except completists.
