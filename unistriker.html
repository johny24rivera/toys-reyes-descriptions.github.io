    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Dinobot
Striker. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines

     This time around, Striker
has probably the most sensible color scheme of his three incarnations (minus
the energon radiation, of course). The reptilian green and brown- with
some greenish gold highlights on the "underbelly"- go together very well.
In beast mode, he looks very realistic (again, minus the energon radiation).
In robot mode, these colors still come together very nicely, and he has
no short of paint or mold detailing anywhere on his body. His energon radiation,
as per usual, looks absolutely brilliant- it's done in a line along his
back in irregular splotches and jagged lines. There's some silver on the
front couple of plates, then black on the interior of the actual back "skin",
then a line of bright red, than silver, then another line of bright red.
Plus, he has some splothces of bright red on his stegosaurus face. Absolutely
brilliant- looks almost like burn marks, in fact. My only complaint is
that it's not really visible in robot mode, but it's obvious it was made
for the beast mode anyways.

     No mold changes have
been made to Striker.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     There's nothing bad
at all about Striker's color scheme this time around, and in fact, it's
probably my favorite color scheme out of his three different paint jobs,
if for nothing else than that spectacular energon radiation paint job.
Recommended.

       Striker is a frontline one-robot wrecking
crew. When called into battle, he uses the inherent strength contained
within his lumbering form to strike methodically and deliberately. His
hide is constructed of specially treated poly-alloy armor, and plates across
his back serve as secondary energy receptors. These plates on his spinal
assembly can collect and store electrical energy and can be discharged
at any opponent located within a 500 meter radius. This energy can also
be channeled and used as a short range attack, fusing a target's circuits.
His tail can be used to cause low level earthquakes near his immediate
vicinity. In robot mode, the grappling rocket assembly in his tail can
be used to penetrate most armor plating. Rumored to be a missing member
of the first generation of Dinobots, Striker had, in fact, been abducted
by the monster planet, Unicron, in his bid to regain dominion over the
universe.
