    This version of Movie
Starscream's F-22 Raptor alternate mode isn't quite the MOST accurate of
the various molds this character has gotten, but it's pretty close, and
visually definitely the most impressive due to the sheer wingspan and size
of said jet-- he's actually more-or-less in scale with a lot of the deluxe-class
Autobots now, heheh! Before I get to the plethora of good stuff about this
mode, though, let's get this out of the way-- yes, his alt mode does have
a it of a "belly" made up of is robot mode appendages. However, unlike
on a lot of TF jets, they tuck away and conform to the general "silouhette",
only become really obvious if you look at him from a straight-on side view--
otherwise the wings tend to cover up the most unseemly parts. (From the
rear you can fairly plainly make out Starscream's waist piece, however.)
So although it's THERE, it's not downright as obvious as many jet mode
TF extras, and I honestly don't mind it tha tmuch. Another slight proportions
problem is that the main wings are a bit smaller than they should be, but
they're still close enough where, again, it's a small matter. The color
scheme is outright bland-- thank goodness that all that gray and dull brown
plastic has those "tattoo" paint apps on the top of this mode to keep things
interesting, as a Starscream of this size without all those intricately
detailed tats would just look really darn boring-- but the mold detailing
is excellent. Flight "panels", turbines, a seat molded inside the cockpit--
it's all there. His two missiles can store underneath his wings in this
mode (though they can't fire like that), and he also has three fold-out
landing gear pieces to keep him level. In addition, as you'd expect from
a toy of this size, he's got electronics-- press the Decepticon button
to the left of his cockpit, and his transparent parts will blink red a
few times while a flying "whoosh" sound emanates from the toy. (During
transformation, the classic G1 transforming sound will also play, though
sometimes you can accidentally activate it multiple times, making it mildly
annoying.)

    Starscream's transformation
is difficult in the sense that it involves a lot of steps, but it's not
frustrating beyond perhaps the first time when you're trying to get the
hang of it. It's not nearly one of those "everything has to be in EXACTLY
the right place to fit together all at once" transformations, whether you're
going from vehicle to robot or the other way around. Only one of the parts--
when you're trying to tab together all the bits and pieces on Starscream's
lower chest-- can it get a tad confusing. (Speaking of which, two of the
tabs that connect the shoulders to the main body are a bit brittle, to
the point where both have broken on mine after only a small handful of
transformations. This is by no means toy-breaking-- it just means that
you have to push one extra part backward manually when Starscream moves
his arms back-- but it is certainly worth noting.) In robot mode, Starscream
has-- by far-- the most accurate depiction of his movie model that's ever
been realized in toy form. I mean, the way the wings in particular figure
into the transformation is simply ingenious. Oh, there's a few minor differences,
like his shoulders being slightly lower than they should be and just a
TOUCH more backpack kibble, but those are both pretty minor. Generally
his proportions and all that wonderful mold detailing is exactly spot-on.
He's about up there with
    <a href="rotfprime.html">
     RotF Leader class Optimus
Prime
    </a>
    in terms of movie accuracy, which is simply astounding given
his designs. Starscream's articulation is also definitely something to
write home about, given his unique body structure-- he can move at he neck,
the shoulders (at FOUR points), the elbows (at two points&lt; at the wrists,
at the base of each of the two thumbs on each of his hand, and at the base
of his three fingers on each hand (all as one piece). He can also move
at the hips (at two points), knees (at three points), and at the ankles.
The shoulders are the most impressive part-- when you move them forward
like Starscream's going to "point" at something, the ENTIRE THIRD of the
body on that side of the body moves with it, really linking the body with
the shoulders in a very nice way that doesn't make his poses look odd.
Given his "chicken-like" feet joints and decently-sized feet, he's also
surprisingly stable, so you can get a nice number of poses with him. As
you'd expect, he also has plenty of gimmicks-- press down on the red tab
on the cockpit on his chest, and he is jaws will open up temporarily, his
eyes and cockpit will light up, and he'll say one of two phrases-- "No
one can defeat Starscream!" or "The Decepticons will crush the Autobots!".
Unfortunately, they're not done by the voice actor for Starscream in the
movie, or even a close approximation of it. It's basically like just taking
someone randomly from your buds and asking them to do an impression of
Starscream-- it's that bad. Yeah it's whiny and fairly high-pitched, but
that's about the extent of it. As such, I prefer to just not play those
sounds. Pressing forward slightly on the red levers on the bottom of each
of Starscream's lower arms will automatically cause his lower arms to split
open, a weapon extending forward in a "firing ready" position. (His left
arm has a double-barreled cannon, his right a rotary machine gun.) Neither
can actually fire missiles, but Starscream also comes with a missile-hand
attachment that can be put on either hand by folding said "real" hand back
against his lower arm. This makes his arm look like it does when it "auto-converts"
to its "weapon mode" in the movies, and you can plug either of his missiles
into it and fire it, spring-loaded, at an enemy. All three parts can store
if you're not using them, though-- the missiles on Starscream's lower back,
the missile-hand attachment in the center of his upper back. Pretty cool
gimmicks, all around, and more important ones that don't really detract
from the toy's design at all.

    Leader class Starscream
is a great figure. His jet mode may have a bit of undercarriage (though
it's not TOO obvious), but the real star of this toy is the robot mode--
it's just SO unbelievably accurate to the movie model, and it comes with
some pretty nice gimmicks on the arms, along with some impressive articulation
and incredibly accurate mold detailing. My favorite Movie Starscream mold
(although the

is SLIGHTLY better than this guy's).

      Optimus Prime may think him a coward,
but Starscream never flees a fight out of fear alone. Every retreat is
calculated to keep him alive long enough to return and destroy his opponents
with overwhelming power. As long as the Autobots seek him in force, he
will remain hidden. As soon as Optimus Prime ventures out alone, however,
Starscream will strike.
