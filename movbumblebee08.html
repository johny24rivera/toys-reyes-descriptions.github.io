    Bumblebee's upgraded
form in the movie-- of a Concept Camaro as opposed to a
    <a href="movbumblebee70.html">
     '70s
Camaro
    </a>
    -- has been made into a deluxe-sized mainline toy, too. In vehicle
mode, Bumblebee is pretty much spot-on accurate when compared to how he
looks in the movie. The proportions are fantastic, and all of the necessary
detailing is there-- he's even got the tiny "Camaro" logo inscribed and
painted on the sides of this mode. (Some people have complained about the
black paint used for his stripes coming off too easily, though, so be careful
about that.) The transparent windows are nice and help the car look more
realistic, though unfortunately it means you can see Bumblebee's robot
parts pretty easily through them, though that isn't a huge deal since the
transparent plastic is so dark. THe only other robot parts that are visible
in this mode are the tips of Bumblebee's toes, which stick out a little
form the underside of the car if you look at it from a side view. That's
a VERY minor complaint, though. Bumblebee's colors are pretty good, with
black, yellow, and blue going together very well, though I wish Bumblebee's
yellow had a bit of a metallic sheen to make the car mode look even more
realistic-- it's just a plain plastic-y yellow here, which doesn't look
as good.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
is, to put it simply, amazing, especially considering what the designers
had to work with. It's really surprising they managed to get so much complexity
into a $10 toy and make him look so movie-accurate in both modes. Because
of his complexity, though, I do worry about a few parts snapping, like
the window pieces on his upper and lower back. The aforementioned windows
behind his upper back also do stick out a bit too much where I especially
worry about this snapping. I do love how all his other car pieces manage
to either complement the look of the mode or cling very closely to his
appendages so that they don't restrict movement. Although his arms are
a bit skinny, otherwise Bumblebee's proportions are perfect in this mode,
and he's got a TON of articulation-- he can move at the head, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips, knees, ankles,
and even a joint in the middle of his chest so he can lean to look downwards
or upwards! The mold detailing is incredible on his parts, with miniature
pistons and hinges apparent everywhere-- his face is especially done nicely,
though a few more paint apps on his legs couldn't have hurt. I also like
the little touches the toy has, like the fact that Bumblebee's chest splits
into three-- something totally unnecessary, but appreciated since it makes
him that much more movie-accurate. His automorph feature involving the
legs is pretty cool, too-- pull his feet down and the rest of his legs
transform by themselves! Bumblebee's weapon is pretty neat, as well-- it
starts off as a hand-held cannon to simulate his "cannon-arm" in the movie,
though you can fold the cannon apart to reveal a transparent energy dagger,
which is certainly cool and unexpected.

    '08 Deluxe Bumblebee
is not just the best version of Movie Bumblebee, but one of the best, most
well-designed movie toys period, and that's saying quite a bit given the
quality of the main movie line. A HIGHLY recommended purchase-- simply
superior over '70s Bumblebee in every way.

      Before he came to Earth, Bumblebee could
have cared less about his appearance. As long as his alternate mode kept
him hidden, and protected his plasma cannon from the weather, he was content.
But now, on Earth, he has found friendship for the first time in as long
as he can remember, in the person of Sam Witwicky. At Sams urging, he
scans a sweet new vehicle form. Now, hes still ready to fight to the end
against the Decepticons, but he sure hopes nothing too bad happens to his
paint job.

       First on Earth, Bumblebee was given
the task of locating and protecting Sam until the other Autobots could
arrive. He found more than a mission to complete. He found friendship among
the humans that he would risk his life to defend. More than that, he found
a place that felt like home for the first time since Cybertron. When he
arrived, he scanned the first vehicle he saw, but once he decided to stay
on Earth, he thought something a little more up to date would help him
feel right at home.

        <p>
         * A "battle damaged" version of this mold was released as a Target Exclusive
in a 2-pack with the '70s deluxe Bumblebee toy, with the same "burnt marks"
as '70s Bumblebee. Otherwise his color scheme is unchanged, though, and
I don't feel that the couple of burn marks significantly add or subtract
from the toy to give a different rating to that variant. Also, Bumblebee
was released with some "Allspark Power" blue in different packaging as
a Target Exclusive in the Spring of '08. (Other than the blue, it was unchanged.)
The blue clashes horribly with the yellow, though, I don't recommend it.
