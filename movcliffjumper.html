    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe '08
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy

     In what is quickly becoming
a trend, Bumblebee has been repainted red as Movie Cliffjumper. And, at
least for me, it's a trend that I don't mind-- I think red looks better
than yellow on almost any toy, and Cliffjumper here is no exception. The
light red looks quite nice as the dominant color on the mold, and I like
the black-edged silver stripes on the front hood of the car-- they look
better and more eye-catching than the straight black stripes on Bumblebee.
A dull charcoal gray is used instead of black. If taken by himself, I probably
would have preferred a straight black instead of dull gray as that would've
contrasted better, but considering the original use of this toy already
had black where the gray is on Cliffjumper, that would make it look like
they just switched yellow to red for this toy and changed little else,
so I guess it is better that they made the change, all things considered.
He still has the transparent blue used for his windows and Energon-sword,
but it's a lighter blue, which goes better against a slightly darker color
like red than a darker shade of blue would have. Cliffjumper also has the
prerequisite "Allspark Power" electric blue paint on him, though it's used
very minimally-- only on the sides of his forearms, a small part on his
waist, and small dots on the sides of his face. Still, it looks good and
contrasts well with the dominant colors-- same with the silver paint apps,
too. And while we're on the subject of Cliffjumper's face, that's the only
part of Cliffjumper I'm not particularly gung-ho about-- he doesn't have
enough paint apps on his face, so it looks almost like he has a red robo-skull
or something instead of "a face with a plug for a mouth" like Bumblebee's.
In fact, overall Cliffjumper's number of paint apps is pretty mediocre--
he could particularly use some on his robot legs.

     Movie Cliffjumper may
not have as many paint apps as I'd like (particularly on his face), but
other than that he looks a little better than Bumblebee, in my opinion.
Not by a HUGE amount, and many Bumblebee fans will no doubt want the original
release of this mold because of the character, but I think Cliffjumper
is still a worthy addition to the line and I'd recommend him to anyone
who already feels they have enough Movie Bumblebee toys.

       Surly and impatient, Cliffjumper is
almost the exact opposite of his friend Bumblebee. Where Bumblebee is sneaky
and careful, Cliffjumper is just loud. He'd rather find the nearest Decepticon
and blow him away than sneak around "gathering intelligence." If you know
where the bad guys are, you really don't need to know anything else, reasons
Cliffjumper. Why not just start blasting and pick up any data you need
afterward from the smoking wreckage? With Megatron and the AllSpark destroyed,
hunting Decepticons is easier  and more fun  than ever.
