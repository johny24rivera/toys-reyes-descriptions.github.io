not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Energon Starscream.

     Skyquake was one of those
TF toys released in the late '80s/early '90s period where a lot of Transformers
had... questionable color schemes. True to the original Skyquake, this
new version has a rather loud color scheme, though it's oddly intriguing
to me. Bright green and orangish-bronze go surprisingly well together,
and the black serves as a nice dark color to help with the contrast. The
transparent light green is a pretty nice "sour apple" shade too, and goes
well with the others. The seafoam green plastic... I'm not so thrilled
about. It's just a bit TOO ugly, even for kitsch's sake. The metallic,
slightly darker shade of that seafoam green on the wings, though-- I wish
that had been used over all the seafoam green parts (where applicable,
of course). It just looks so much better and goes well with the other colors.
And, as you'd expect from a Botcon toy, Skyquake's got tons of paint apps.
Black, orange, light green-- paint apps of those colors are all over the
jet and robot mode, and the "battle damage" molded into the design is painted
bright red like some sort of energy leak and looks great, as well. I'm
not too fond of them bringing over the pink from the original Skyquake
onto this one-- it's a bit TOO obnoxious-- but at least they toned it down
to a dull purplish pink and it's only used as an accent color in a few
places.

     Botcon 2009 Skyquake
is a must-get if you have a bit of a thing for color schemes that are rather
loud and unrealistic (which I can sometimes like, in certain cases), and
the mold celebrates its ugliness and remains faithful to the original's
color scheme while "dulling it down" slightly. I think that although it's
better than the retail releases of this mold,
     <a href="bcleozack.html">
      Leozack
     </a>
     is slightly better just because he's not so obviously loud, but this is
still a nice homage repaint for what it is. Of course, if you prefer your
Transformers colored more realistically, this is an easy pass.

     <i>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       A master of body-structure science,
Skyquake pioneered the development of the first mass-produced "Skyraider"
body frame and he continually strives for its perfection. The development
of unique "talent powers" and ever-larger and more combat-capable designs
are his engineering specialities. As a reward for these feats, he was given
his own squad to command, though he is far from thrilled with those whom
he leads. This is no surprise, as he is filled with hatred for anything
that falls short of his merciless ideals. Prepared for all contingencies,
he is rumored to have a secret stash of body designs and backed-up programming
culled from his various minions. He focuses his hate through single-minded
rationality that drives his monstrous scientific and combative endeavors.
His vast array of sensors allows him to absorb and interpret immense amounts
of visual information. To outside observers, this awareness appears almost
supernatural. His sensor-laced right arm is ultra-sensitive and vulnerable
to attack.
