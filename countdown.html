not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Defense Red Alert.

     Universe 2.0 continues
its schtick of homaging formerly teeny toys with big repaints with Countdown
here, who was originally a moon buggy Micromaster. The colors are mostly
the same as on the G1 version, being red and white with some dark blue
added to help vary things a bit more given the large size of this toy.
The dark blue really works well, particularly in vehicle mode, and contrasts
very well with the white and red. A dark transparent blue is used fo the
transparent bits, and looks quite nice against the gray and white. Making
the white almost solely reserved for the rocket-missile was a very good
decision as well, as it makes it look more like a space rocket-- appropriate,
given Countdown's history. His heavy treads and armored plating on the
main vehicle even make it so he wouldn't look out-of-place on some remote
moon or asteroid, so all things considered this was an ingenious choice
to repaint the mold into Countdown. Countdown's color scheme also allows
for several paint apps, mainly of the silver and dark navy blue variety.
Suffice it to say this definitely isn't one of the toy's weakness, as no
patch of plastic is particularly barren, save for the rear gray part of
the rocket.

     Universe 2.0 Countdown
is a pretty nice repaint of a dynamite mold, and a great obscure homage
to boot. If you don't have any version of this mold, get this toy or the
original Red Alert version-- either color scheme looks equally good, IMO.
If money is no object, though, then spring for
     <a href="bcmegatron.html">

     instead, though, as I like that color scheme
a little better than this one.

       Autobot Countdown is a hero to millions
of beings on thousands of planets, and a legend to even more. Even before
other Autobots began venturing out into the universe, Autobot Countdown
was out there, traveling from world to world, freeing those enslaved by
tyrants, or oppressed by evil. He has traveled from one end of the galaxy
to the other, seen things others can only dream about, and along the way
he has left behind a trail of worlds basking in the warm glow of freedom.
