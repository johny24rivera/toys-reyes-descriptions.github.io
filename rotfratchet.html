    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original TF1 voyager
Ratchet. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
TF1 voyager Ratchet

isn't really different from the original release in any way that matters.
His general color scheme of dull pea green and gray is still there, with
most of the same paint apps. Most of the differences between this version
and the original are actually minor knocks against THIS version. For one,
there's no black, just more of the gray, which doesn't go nearly as well
against the pea green as the black did on the original. There also appears
to be overall fewer paint apps on this version, though the absolutely necessary
ones like the "heartbeat" sign on the side are still there, of course.
The one thing Desert Tracker Ratchet has in his favor is the "sand spray"
paint apps on the sides of his vehicle mode and his front bumper. They
give him a bit more of a "worn" feeling, and certainly fits in with many
of the scenes in Revenge of the Fallen. They also contrast fairly well
with the bumper, though it's noting outstanding or anything.

     Desert Tracker Ratchet
is a mildly recommended pickup if you missed the first releases of this
mold and really want to have the character in a show-accurate color scheme
in a fairly large size. Otherwise, either get one of the other versions
of this mold-- all of which have better color schemes than this guy as
of this writing (1/11)-- or get a smaller version of the character instead.
This repaint is just bleh all over, pretty much.

       Racing across the dunes of the northern
Sahara desert, the roar of his engine echoing off the ever-shifting dunes,
Autobot Ratchet charges towards the inevitable confrontation with Megatron
and his assembled Decepticon army. Though he has battled against odds this
bad in the past, no fight before has meant so much. He knows the fate of
the universe rests on the outcome of this conflict, and he will do everything
in his power to see to it that his allies come through it safe and victorious.
