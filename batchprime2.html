    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Battle Charger
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Like a long of the Optimus
Prime repaints in the late portion of the RotF line, Cyber Armor Optimus
Prime's main difference from his movie-accurate color scheme is that the
front part has been painted silver. This also extends to his rear wheels
and definitely adds a little more contrast to the toy, as well as a bit
more "metallic" of a look. In addition, much of the dark blue plastic near
the back end and on the front bumper has been replaced with a light red,
which has also replaced the slightly duller red plastic of the initial
Battle Charger release of Prime. The lighter red is a bit TOO light, though,
making a color scheme slightly on the loud side that otherwise wouldn't
be. Of course, the Movie line needs a few more toys that tends towards
the loud side of the color scheme spectrum. The core paint apps-- such
as the flames in vehicle mode, as well as where most of the paint apps
are placed on his robot mode parts-- are unchanged from the initial release.,
though with the addition of the silver paint in vehicle mode, the paint
on the front grille has been removed, but since it's mostly supposed to
be silver anyways I suppose that's no biggie. The only exception to this
is that the color of paint used for the vehicle mode windows and eyes/chest
windows in robot mode is now a much lighter, glossier blue than on the
first Battle Charger Prime. It works quite well on the windows, but for
the eyes it's a tad too light and doesn't contrast well with the other
silver paint apps on his face. One final, fairly minor, caveat is that
with the new plastic color layout, Prime's arms in robot mode are light
red on the outside and abruptly change to dark blue on their inside halves,
which doesn't look all that hot.

     No mold changes have
been made to Cyber Armor Optimus Prime.

     Cyber Armor Optimus
Prime has a few pluses-- like the addition of more silver paint and a lighter,
more dynamic color scheme-- but it comes at a minor cost, like oddly-colored
robot arms and a less attractive shade of red. Overall, though, I think
this version looks slightly better than the original, mostly due to that
nice metallic silver paint.

       After some of his recent battles, Optimus
Prime thought it might be a good idea to have a little more protection
in the future. New armor gives him a slick new look, and lets him shrug
off even the most powerful blow.
