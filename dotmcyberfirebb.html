    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM deluxe
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM deluxe Bumblebee toy

     As usual, a redeco of
Movie Bumblebee's been made with the primary colors reversed, but it's
not a simple palette swap here-- i.e., black with yellow stripes. Cyberfire
Bumblebee's main color is black and his main accent color yellow, but this
is done with a rather extensive (and quite awesome-looking) series of "flame"
paint apps along his top and sides in vehicle mode. The flames go along
for so long they almost look like lightning bolts, particularly on the
car doors and roof. It definitely helps to distinguish this Movie 'Bee
from all of the others, but that's not the only thing that's been done
for this redeco. His rear spoiler, lower legs, and lower arms are also
yellow. The "grays"-- i.e., the shades of light gray and dark gray plastic--
are roughly the same place here that they are on most Movie 'Bee toys,
being mostly on his "robot bits", with his (unchanged from the first DotM
toy) Mechtech weapon being a lighter shade of gray. The other striking
change, though, is that his transparent plastic is now a rather fiery shade
of red. This includes not only his windows, but his eyes in robot mode--
there's a reason why a popular nickname for this redeco is "Murderbee";
it makes him look more than a little evil.

     No mold changes have
been made to Cyberfire Bumblebee.

     DotM Cyberfire Bumblebee
is, yes, another movie 'Bee repaint-- but it's a "stealth' repaint with
a twist. The many fiery paint apps in vehicle mode really look great and
make him stand out on a shelf, and the red transparent plastic really works
well with the black, to boot. This is one of my favorite looks out of any
Bumblebee toy, at least when it comes to the paint job-- recommended, even
if you have the original DotM deluxe Bumblebee toy.

       Bumblebee has earned his position as
one of the most respected Autobots by consistently besting Decepticon foes.
He established a library of battle strategies within the Autobot supercomputer
