    Megatron's alternate
mode is... something else. I mean, Prime Megatron's alternate mode is a
bit questionable on all of his toys-- and to be fair, that has been show-accurate.
At this small scale, though... it looks like Hasbro simply wasn't able
to make his vehicle mode look even remotely like an actual thing and not
just a rearrangement of his body parts. His wings aren't nearly as curved
as they are on his other toys, being just his kneecaps, and they've got
big ugly bolts in the middle of them; without anything to try to hide his
shoulders or hands, it's painfully obvious that his arms are the main body
of his vehicle mode, though at least they peg securely together with Megs'
fusion cannon in the middle; and those are the BETTER parts of this mode.
The front "nosecone" area of Megatron's futuristic spacecraft mode is simply
atrocious here; for starters, unlike the other Prime Megatron toys, there
isn't even an ATTEMPT to hide Megatron's head here-- it's just there, plain
as day. The middle portion of the "nosecone" is also made of transparent
purple plastic-- an interesting choice color-wise, but nonsensical when
it comes to forming what should be a solid-looking piece. The folding part
of his chest that forms the cockpit or "tip of the nosecone" is about as
effective here as on the other Prime Megatron toys, but that's no complement.
It still looks like a vaguely evil... something. The atrocious actual construction
of this mode aside, the amount of purple helps to keep Megatron from looking
too boring color-wise here; beyond the aforementioned transparent purple
plastic, there's also a pretty good amount of dark metallic purple on his
wings and main body, which contrasts quite well with the light gray. There's
also a nice bit of metalllic gunmetal gray on a few places like his hands
and face, and a darker, swirly plastic version of the color on parts like
his upper legs, both of which complement his main light gray color well
and also just look fairly nice even on their own. For an accessory, Megatron
has a transparent purple plastic sword, which in this mode is usually pegged
above his fusion cannon, though it can also be plugged into the tip of
said fusion cannon, in a manner similar to how he'll have it "flip out"
in front of his cannon in the show. You can also have him just hold it
in his hands, if you want.

    Megatron's robot mode,
however... wowie wow wow! It is SPOT ON accurate to the show model, even
moreso than his larger toys. There's no extras at all-- not even a little
piece or two behind his main body. You really can't tell that he's a Transformer
at all in this mode, and the spikes and evil look of him are captured excellently
in the mold detailing, even at this small of a scale. The facesculpt is
spot-on, and his mold detailing captures the Prime aesthetic quite well,
with large patches of relatively little detail that alternate between round
and sharp edges, with a few spots of intricate detail like the purple "turbines"
on his lower arms. His proportions are also spot-on to the show, and his
articulation is very good for the size-- he can move at the shoulders (at
two points), elbows, hips, and knees (at two points), and most of these
are ball joints. Thus, given his good balance, you can get some pretty
nice poses out of him, though his lack of neck movement does hurt him a
little here. Like the other Prime 2012 Commander toys, Megatron's core
body is composed of transparent plastic, with a peg on the upper back that
allows you to connect one of the Cyberverse-sized electronic playset pieces
to it that will allow Megatron's chest to "light up". It works SLIGHTLY
better than on most other Commander class figures, but it still doesn't
work that well on ol' Megs, and generally isn't worth even trying.

    Prime Cyberverse Megatron
might be a consideration if you're only ever planning on leaving him in
robot mode (as this one has the best robot mode out of his various toys
of this design), but if you ever want to transform him at all, save up
your money for one of the larger toys of him. This toy's alternate mode
is just incredibly bad in pretty much every respect.
