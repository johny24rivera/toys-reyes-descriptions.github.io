    Thunderhoof's tractor
alternate mode is done up... decently... for his 3-step version. The main
body is pretty solid, though Thunderhoof's... hooves... are pretty obvious
right there in the front, especially since they're painted. The little
tractor cockpit section looks pretty nice up top, but there's a light blue
stripe down the center that's accurate to the robot mode, but not to this
mode-- it makes no sense why there'd be a big raised stripe down the center
in this mode. The treaded wheels are big and honkin' and look quite nice
with their wheel covers (though the charcoal black on the wheel covers
would've looked better as a solid black like the wheels themselves). The
best-looking part is the front, with really thick sections that look pretty
decently like the front of a harvester (though they're a bit curved, unlike
the threshers on a real one). The weakest part of this mode, though, is
defintely the rear-sides and the back, which are essentially revealed inner
bits because of the transformation. There's some obvious light blue rectangular
pieces on the sides that are used in the transformation and poke through
underneath the main cockpit. By themselves they're not that bad, but having
faux tractor windows and door hinges instead down
    <i>
     in front of the rear
tires
    </i>
    is a real eyesore and was just a bad idea. (There seriously wasn't
a better way to get those out of the way, even on a simple toy like this?
Really?) There also isn't a real back end to this toy, as it's just the
core section of what becomes the center portion of the main robot mode
that everything else pivots around, surrounded by some blah light milky
gray hinges (thankfully, this color isn't used elsewhere on the toy). It's
also a bit of an eyesore, though not as bad as the faux tractor sides,
that's for sure. Thunderhoof's general color scheme is what you'd expect,
being mostly a slightly dark shade of blue, with some lighter blue paint
on the roof, some milky teal plastic on some inner rectangular parts, and
some dark metallic teal on the top of the front section of the mode. This
latter shade is a nice color, but is too close to the blue plastic so it
doesn't stick out as much as it should. There's some black on the windows
(both "real" and "faux") beyond what I've already mentioned, and that's
it as far as major colors on the toy. It's a decent color scheme, though
I wish the blue was a titch lighter to help the other colors contrast against
it better. The mold detailing is the usual for a RID2015 toy-- fairly sparse
overall, with a few stylistic details on the top of the mode, along with
angular windows. There's also molded smokestacks and even ridiculously
undersized side doors on the cockpit, though they aren't painted. Oddly
there's "door handles" molded into the faux sides near the bottom, but
not on the actual doors. Weird.

    You transform the 3-step
version of Thunderhoof just like the
    <a href="rid21stepthunderhoof.html">
     1-step
version
    </a>
    -- take the front harvester section, rotate it back behind the
tractor, and slot it in above the cockpit, and everything else auto-transforms.
The end result looks much better than the tractor mode and is definitely
the focus of this toy. That said, there still are a few proportional maladies.
For one, Thunderhoof has a real barrel of a chest, which sticks out way
too far and looks kinda odd. The shoulders are also oversized even for
"buff shoulders"-- it's pretty ridiculous-looking, especially if you have
the arms pointing forward. Pointing downwards the arms look a little longer
and more proportional, but facing forward they just barely stick out beyond
the front of the chest. (The shoulders moving forward-and-back at the elbows
is the only articulation this toy has-- of course I wish he had more, but
articulation isn't the point of these simpified toys.) The face and antlers,
though, look VERY good-- great mold detailing with a silver face and bulky
neck, a black "helmet" around the face, and dark red eyes. Unlike most
Thunderhoof toys, the antlers are actually the same as that used for the
thresher bits on the tractor mode as opposed to him having a separate "set"
of antlers for this mode, which I love. The antlers are nice and thick
too, so he looks like he could do some real damage with them. The legs
are pretty solid (although a bit stiff-looking because of a lack of articulation),
though the wheels go back behind his lower legs a bit far. Because so many
parts are shared between this mode and the tractor mode, there's not much
new mold or paint detailing to talk about here beyond the aforementioned
head. The waist and upper legs are nice with some more angular detailing,
and the hands are nicely sculpted poking out from the lower arms. The lower
hands are painted black, while the abs are a nice combo of black, silver,
and light blue, with some silver on the upper legs. Overall the color scheme
is definitely more varied and catches the eye more easily in this mode.

    The 3-step changer version
of Thunderhoof is only a bit better than his 1-step changer, unfortunately,
despite the larger size. His robot mode looks pretty decent for a simplistic
toy-- the arms and chest look a bit funny, but the rest is nice, and the
headsculpt is aces-- but his tractor mode is fairly weak, with robot extras
and obvious "holes" in the sides and back of the mode. Only recommended
if you want to get a larger, simplified toy of him for a kid. Or you're
just a Thunderhoof completist, of course.
