    2016 was the second year
for Robots in Disguise, so Bumblebee gets a new 1-step mold... I'd like
to say because
    <a href="rid21stepbee.html">
     the first
    </a>
    is pretty bad,
but it's probably just to justify him still being in the assortment in
his normal color scheme given that he's pretty much the main character
of the series. Anyways, in alt mode Bumblebee is pretty accurate and proportional,
for the most part. The only exceptions to this are the very front and the
very back. The front section should be a bit more angular but isn't because
of the transformation; as is the front is pretty straight up-and-down at
the sides, which doesn't look quite as good as the slightly angular front
grill on many of his other toys. The back end also has two fairly obvious
robot feet sticking up from the top, with the rear pointy fins not as large
as they are on most other toys of the character. Still, the feet can kinda
look like a spoiler... somewhat. So that helps some, and I'd consider this
only a moderate downside at best, not a mode-ruining issue. There's also
some pretty prevalent and distracting cracks in the front hood, which is
a result of the transformation. The mold detailing is pretty accurate to
the show, i.e. fairly sparse but with some more intricate "layered panels"
detailing on the front bumper. The rear bumper surprisingly has some details
as well including the taillights, though sadly they aren't painted. Bumblebee's
usual color scheme is present, consisting of yellow and a bit of black
(plastic on the wheels, metallic paint on the front and back windows as
well as on the diagonal details on the hood and in the middle of the front
bumper). Beyond those two colors, though, there's only a bit of blue used
for the headlights. It's a really nice shade of blue, and I really wish
it was used for the windows-- it would've been more accurate to most of
his other toys, as well. This mode could've used a bit more color, certainly.

    This version of 'Bee
follows the "jack-knifing" transformation used on several other one-steps,
where you take the back end pieces and rotate them out and downwards, and
the rest falls into place automatically. It's still pretty much my favorite
one-step transformation, it's just so much fun and addicting. The end result
definitely keeps the general look of RID 'Bee, but does have the same issues
in this mode as many of the other 1-steps with this transformation. From
the front he looks pretty good, though his "door backpack" is far too small
proportionally and incorrectly black, to boot. Most of the weakness of
this mode comes when you look at it from a side angle, when you can see
that the legs go way up to nearly the shoulders and are hollow on the out-facing
side angle, with unfortunately no mold detailing inside to help them look
more like the sides of his robot mode. His chest is also just a flap in
front of his super-long legs and doesn't peg into anything, so it dangles
off the front and moves back-and-forth slightly. All this said, again,
from a front view he's pretty nice. The detailing on the chest is great,
complete with the faux window-and-bumper chest, as well as the abs and
waist molded in. The waist and chest are a nice metallic black, with some
silver paint on the abs, though the only other paint visible in this mode
is on his head, which has a black vent on the forehead, a silver face,
and blue eyes. The headsculpt itself is a little bit too "rounded" and
small proportionally-- probably for transformational reasons-- but is otherwise
pretty good. The arms also have pretty accurate detailing, but have no
paint to bring out any of it, unfortunately. For articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the shoulders at two points, and that's it-- though then again,
articulation isn't the point of one-steps.

    The 2016 1-step version
of Bumblebee has the usual "don't-look-at-it-from-the-side" issues in robot
mode that come with the jack-knifing transformation, he could use some
more paint detailing, and his feet are pretty obvious in vehicle mode.
That said, for a 1-step it still looks pretty good from the intended angles
in both modes, and the transformation is just so much fun. If you're going
to get a 1-step version of RID Bumblebee, make it this mold.
