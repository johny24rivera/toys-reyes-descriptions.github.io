    Optimus Prime's "Cyber
Battalion" toy is very much a straight "update" of his
    <a href="g1prime.html">

    </a>
    and traditional look. He's got the rather square, flat-nose truck
look (though with a bit of a windvane this time), and it's pretty obvious
that the truck bed in the back are his robot legs-- I really wish the feet
could have folded down or something. Other than that, this mold is pretty
extra-free and looks quite good. I like the additional mold detailing beyond
simply "the basics" such as all the little lines on the wheels, four sets
of headlights on the roof, and a few other "panel-y" details on the sides
of the cab that aren't the doors. The color scheme is very much your classic
Prime-- he's red, dark blue, and a bit of gray (a more "regular" shade
of gray as opposed to the usual awful light milky shade-- thank goodness).
Some of the red plastic used for his cab is just a tad off, though, and
noticeably duller than the other red plastic for some odd reason. As far
as paint apps, they're mostly adequate, though a few odd choices were made.
The front windows are painted a nice light blue that contrasts excellently
with the red, and the front four headlights are painted yellow; there's
also some silver on the wheel hubs and on what becomes his lower robot
legs on the back. However-- painting the hubcaps instead of stuff like
side windows, or the silver tanks on the side that are kept blue, or ignoring
all the taillight details on the back end and the eight (!) headlights
on the roof of the truck? That's a bit of a bummer. Another issue I have
with this mode is that the joints holding up the legs/rear section aren't
strong enough-- if you pick the toy up by the front as you normally would,
the legs droop down a fair bit-- however, there are little slots for the
upper legs to tab into to keep them "pegged in" in this mode.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
to robot mode is pretty much taken straight from the
    <a href="aalegg1prime.html">

    , with the arms folding out from the sides
with the wheels attached to the bottom of them and the truck grill and
bumper section rotating around to show a more compact faux truck "abdomen"
in its place. At this size, I'm really not a fan of big chunks like the
wheels just hanging off the bottom of the arms, or a big square block behind
the robot head, but other than that this mode looks pretty good, proportional,
and quite accurate to Prime's traditional G1 form. The headsculpt is quite
well-done, with well-sculpted antennae and face mask, along with a painted
center head "vent", face, and faceplate. The abs are also done nicely,
looking pretty well-proportioned while carrying over the necessary details
from the grill and front bumper. However, the lower arms are a little weak,
merely being molded into the sides of the truck mode. Additionally, beyond
the face, there isn't much paint on Prime's robot-mode-only parts; just
a bit of red on his midsection, and the silver vents near the bottom of
his feet. His arms and upper legs in particular could have used some paint.
As for articulation, Prime can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), and the hips (at two points, though as mentioned earlier,
one of the points-- the front-to-back direction-- is rather loose). I see
no reason why the neck couldn't move side-to-side, and there's absolutely
no reason for a lack of knee articulation at this scale, even given the
younger-than-usual age bracket that this subline is aimed at. Additionally,
Prime could really use his trademark gun, or SOME kind of weapon-- he's
got the holes in his fists for one.

    Cyber Battalion Optimus
Prime is a pretty nice representation of his iconic G1 design at a level
of complexity appropriate for younger fans that aren't quite "ready" for
more complex Generations toys, though it does have some noticeable drawbacks,
like the robot arms, a lack of any kind of weaponry, overly loose legs,
no knee articulation, and a lack of paint in some areas. Still, proportionally
he looks nice in both modes and is simple to transform without feeling
overly "cheap" or soft-- which is good, given his price at Walgreens and
especially his more-expensive price at Universal Studios' "
