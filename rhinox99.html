    Beast mode is a rhino.
The color scheme in this mode, is, in my opinion, much better than the
    <a href="rhinox.html">
     original
    </a>
    . The pale greenish blue is already a
nice touch, but when you add a bunch of black stripes on his back similar
to the original

    brown ones, WOW! What
a color scheme! One of the downsides to this mode, however, is that there
is very few points of articulation; mainly just the mouth and the back
legs.

    Transformation to robot
mode is not so actually hard as it is to try to position the "flesh plates"
so that they don't get in the way. That is the major downside to the robot
mode; the large flesh plates on the waist and arms hamper movement a lot,
and get in the way. Other than that, this mode is nice, and is one of the
few deluxe Transformers with two weapons; a rotating "chain gun o' death"
and a sword. The "mutant head" splits in the middle and folds out to reveal
the robot head, but the head plates don't swing all the way out, unfortunately,
so it's better just to leave the mutant head like it is. The color scheme
changes greatly in this mode, revealing the robot inside to look somewhat
like a fire-type transformer, with the fiery reds and oranges dominating
his robot parts.

    A better quality toy
and a better color scheme than the original Rhinox. Recommended over the
original.

      The ground shakes with a terrible thunder
as jungle trees snap like twigs. The noise draws closer in a cloud of dust
and dirt. A herd of stampeding elephants? No. It is Rhinox, defending his
territory from Predacon attackers! Courageous and cunning, has never backed
down from battle, nor been injured in any way. Not even double barreled
laser cannons can cut through his triple thick, steel plated skin! If he
comes your way, run for cover...fast!
