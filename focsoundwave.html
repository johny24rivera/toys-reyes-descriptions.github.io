     Laserbeak-- like all
of the Legends/Legion-sized toys for the Generations "Fall of Cybertron"
subline-- is a data disk in his alt mode. It's a rather thick disc-- but
then again, that's kind of necessary to give him a decent beast mode. There's
not much play value in this mode, but there wasn't much play value in a
cassette tape alt mode either, and a Cybertronian data disc performs basically
the same function. Put simply, this is a ingenious way to update the popular
G1 Cassette 'Cons and 'Bots into a more "modernized" form. There are a
few "cracks" in the side of the disc to make the transformation work, but
they aren't so bad that they compromise the "illusion" of the data disc.
The light red and black colors contrast against each other quite well,
though I particularly LOVE the silver circuitry pattern on the top of this
mode. Granted, it's on all the other FoC data disk 'Cons and 'Bots too,
but that doesn't make it any less awesome.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Like all the other data
disc 'Bots and 'Cons, Laserbeak is supposed to transform automatically
when ejected from his "host" toy. There's a small black button on the underside
of the data disc mode that accomplishes this, and on this mold at least,
this gimmick pretty much always works, and is thus always awesome. (You
have to manually fold and press the pieces back together to get him back
into disc mode, but this is pretty simple and there's an audible "click"
when you're done-- and no, Laserbeak does NOT come undone easily unless
you press his button, which I was pleasantly surprised at.) In bird mode,
Laserbeak's circular wings formed from the sides of the data disc look
great and are ingenious, and I like how his tailfeathers are also formed
out of most of the top of the disc. The mold detailing is also excellent
in this mode, with little FoC-esque circuitry and styling details all over
the figure, along with "spine"-like detailing along Laserbeak's back. His
head is also nicely-detailed and angular, as it should be-- however, the
eyes desperately need paint apps, along with his tailfeather piece. The
circuitry lines on part of his back and the silver detailing on his wings
is good and all, but I'd trade the latter for paint in those other places,
particularly the eyes. Having what LOOKS like an eye-less head, what with
the black plastic and all, just looks bad. Laserbeak also doesn't really
have any feet to speak of in this mode, and due to his spring-loaded gimmick,
he doesn't have any articulation, either. However, given the small size
and how awesome the gimmick is, I'm considerably more forgiving of these
flaws in this figure than I otherwise would be.

       Although it's a completely
new mold, this "WfC/FoC" version of Soundwave emulates the same general
design as the Generations deluxe
       <a href="genwfcsoundwave.html">
        "Cybertronian"
Soundwave toy
       </a>
       , so it's worth checking out that link if you aren't familiar
with the previous version of this design; I'm definitely gonna refer to
it a fair bit in this review. That aside, this version of FoC Soundwave
is considerably larger (even a bit big for a Voyager-class toy in recent
years), and the vehicle mode is a bit bulkier and beefier, particularly
in how tall it is compared to its width. It looks considerably more proportional
this way, and there's a few new features here-- namely, the seat molded
near the top back end (though it can't fit any TF figures I can think of),
and Soundwave's chain-gun weapon mounted just in front of that seat. The
five-clawed front bumper still looks as cool as ever, though the side two
claws in front of the wheels don't stick out as oddly far in this mode
compared to "Cybertronian" Soundwave. A lot of the same general details
that emulate his video game appearance are on this toy as well, though
this version has pretty cool transparent light purple wheels and a chest.
Granted, the former isn't really game-accurate, but it still looks pretty
cool and plays up the "futuristic" look of this Soundwave pretty well.
Unfortunately, the back end of the vehicle mode is still a bit hollow on
this version, and I wish the front section above the piece that becomes
Soundwave's chest had a bit of "window"-like paint/mold detailing on it,
as it still looks like there's a little something missing there. Given
their different color from the surrounding pieces, Soundwave's robot feet
also stick out slightly near the back end in this mode, though this is
a minor issue at best. The overall color scheme of dark blue and gray with
some red is classic Soundwave, and I think it looks pretty decent, if not
spectacular. (I wish the gray had been more of a metallic shade, in particular.)
The bits of red, gold, and light purple do help vary up the color scheme
a bit more, though, and with the exception of the top front area, makes
sure that Soundwave doesn't have too large an area of just one color in
this mode.

      <br/>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       The transformation to
robot mode is mostly identical to Cybertronian Soundwave's, though the
end result-- because of the central "gimmick" of this toy and the bulkier
proportions of the vehicle mode-- is, in turn, a bulker, more beefy-looking
robot mode. However, this is a good thing, considering Cybertronian Soundwave
looked a bit too skinny in his robot mode for my tastes. The central chest
area may be a tad more "square" and sticks out a little more than I'd like,
but other than that Soundwave's proportions are pretty solid here. His
arms are beefy enough, his legs are beefy enough, and though he has a few
"vehicle kibble" bits-- particularly his front wheels, folded against the
back part of his stomach-- they tend to stay out of the way of articulation
and aren't as big of an eyesore as they were on the deluxe version of this
design. I will say that-- though they're "thick" enough-- I'm not a big
fan of this Soundwave's lower arm design; there's fairly noticeable hollow
bits below his fists that are a bit unsightly. The mold detailing is very
game-accurate and crisp, particularly on Soundwave's excellent head sculpt,
and the light piping used for his optic works very well. As for Soundwave's
central "gimmick" that the toy is built around, it's DARN solid. By pressing
on the gray trigger to the left side of his head, the front of his chest
will fall open. Once this is done, you can push forward on the large slider
mechanism on Soundwave's back (made easily pushable because of the large
roof/chair piece that becomes his back in this mode) to launch out Soundwave's
minion in his chest, just like his G1 design with cassettes! The data disc
minions should transform automatically once they're out, which is also
a really nice feature. You can store not one, not two, but up to THREE
data disc Transformers inside Soundwave's chest at one time in this mode,
and he can launch them all in one push, one-two-three, which is just a
super neat effect. (The more data discs you have in Soundwave's chest,
though, the further back you have to pull his slider mechanism to accomodate
them-- so when he has his max number in there, his back can be a bit...
well,
       <i>
        back
       </i>
       there.) He can also fire a minion in vehicle mode, but
it looks a bit more odd, given you have to partially open up the front
end to be able to do so. Soundwave's chaingun weapon plugs into its traditional
position on the right side of his head, or he can hold it in one of his
hands. As for articulation, Soundwave can move at the shoulders (at three
points), elbows (at two points), wrists (at two points), hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and forward-and-back at the ankles. Unfortunately,
his head can't move at all (likely due to all the space his disc-launching
gimmick requires), and he doesn't have any waist articulation, either.
However, he's very well-balanced and many of his joints are ratcheted,
so you can still get a number of great poses out of the toy.

         Soundwave has spent centuries making
himself indispensible to the Decepticon cause. His body is packed with
electronic communications gear. He is capable of teasing even the faintest

code, and jamming the most powerful signal. Together with his minions,
he is one of the most effective weapons in the Decepticon arsenal.

         FoC Soundwave &amp; Laserbeak
is a stupendous two-pack. Neither of them are
         <i>
          perfect
         </i>
         , but Hasbro
has finally brought back Soundwave's "minion-launching" in an effective,
modern manner, and gives you plenty of options of which 'Cons to store
in him if you buy his Legends two-packs, as well. Even ignoring the gimmick
of the toy, though, Soundwave is a pretty good design with better proportions
in both modes compared to his earlier deluxe "Cybertronian" Generations
toy, very nice articulation, and minimal kibble in both modes. Laserbeak--
while not articulated-- still has an awesome gimmick that mostly overlooks
all that, and is the best data disc minion mold to boot, in my opinion.
A highly recommended set if you're at all interested in the "Soundwave
&amp; his minions" gimmick.
