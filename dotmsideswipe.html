    Sideswipe's vehicle mode
has undergone a bit of an underhaul for Dark of the Moon-- although he's
still a Corvette Centennial Stingray sportscar, he's now an open-topped
version of that car. Proportionally, he's still perfect (as you'd expect
a mainline Transformer with a licensed alt mode to be here), with no real
robot extras EXCEPT where you can see through his "open top". Although
there are seats molded in there, it's pretty obvious from the gaps in this
space that they're on the back of his upper legs, and overall it just pulls
you out a little. What pulls you out even more is that Sideswipe's silvery
shiny paint finish that's been on most of his previous toys is gone, with
a very dull brownish gray plastic taking its place. It doesn't look remotely
like a car's finish, and combined with the fact that all of his other major
colors-- fron black to a grayish blue to gunmetal gray-- are rather monochromatic,
he has a very boring color scheme. Sideswipe's Mechtech weapon is quite
cool-- if you push forward on the back end if the blaster, a blade pops
out to make it a sword. It's a simple but neat conversion, though more
than most others this Mechtech weapon could REALLY use a "locking" feature
for its "transformed" mode. Sideswipe has three Mechtech ports-- one in
the center-back, and one on each side in front of the rear wheel.

    Sideswipe's robot mode
transformation is considerably more straightforward than his previous deluxe
toys, but unfortunately it also ends up with a lot more back kibble. Nearly
his entire car body-- the center of his hood, the car doors, the back end--
all hang off his back unceremoniously. They compact a little, but they
don't tab or lock into place anywhere, and his center roof piece in particular
can pop off easily during transformation. His feet are also extraordinarily
awkward; he still has the chicken-walker feet and can stand up pretty steadily,
but the front sections of his bumper that are supposed to form the "toes"
are instead, weirdly, the heels in the recommended transformation, with
little tiny pieces for his actual "toes". It looks off. If you rotate the
heels and toes around on each feet, it does look better, but then the feet
point in the wrong direction. It's a bit of a sticking point with me, given
how unnecessary it seems. The upper leg, chest, and arm proportions are
all spot-on, though, and Sideswipe's arm-blades now look a bit skinnier
and more like actual blades than on previous versions of the toy. Sideswipe's
mold detailing on parts of his robot mode is quite good-- particularly
on the chest, upper arms, and legs-- but his paint detailing is only on
what's absolutely necessary and pretty much no more. He's got no paint
on his arms and only one paint app on each of his legs and chest (not counting
the wheels). It's a shame, as more could've really brought out all that
neat detailing. Sideswipe can hold his Mechtech weapon in this mode, but
like on most other deluxes, it's a bit large for him; plus, his swords
can sometimes get in the way a bit. As for articulation, Sideswipe can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles-- pretty average for
a deluxe these days.

    DotM "mainline" Sideswipe
is a bit of a disappointment, overall. I LOVED both of his previous deluxe
toys, but here he ends up looking very boring (though proportional and
mostly kibble-free) in vehicle mode and with a ton of kibble in robot mode.
I think making him a convertible was a bad idea, as it left less room to
hide some of his bits. I'd get one of the other mainline versions of the
character over this one.

      Sideswipe confronts his Decepticon enemies
on two feet with Cybertanium blades honed and at the ready. He finds projectile
weaponry too easy. Nothing beats the blade. His Autobot pals seek him out
for lessons on the ancient art of Cybertronian swordplay just in case they
have to get up close and personal with a Decepticon.
