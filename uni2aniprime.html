    Odd that a toy based
on the Animated version of Optimus Prime comes out in Universe 2.0, given
that both toy lines were running at the same time. Well anyways, this Prime's
truck mode really isn't the best one you can find when it comes to Animated
Prime's vehicle mode, as there are some pretty noticeable robot mode extras
in it. The biggest is the VERY easily seen feet which make up the back
end of the truck mode. I mean, I they could not have made them more obvious
if they tried-- the legs don't fit in with the overall shape of the surrounding
parts at all, and due the Animated aesthetic on this small of a toy are
pretty big. The knees and upper legs are also fairly obvious near the middle
of this mode, and the arms are fairly obvious coming out of the sides of
the cab as well. The fists are folded in on the front so that they're not
apparent, but it frankly makes little difference-- the arms stick out so
much compared to the rest of the cab they're still obviously the arms.
At least the top half of the cab looks pretty decent, though, and he hasÂ 
Prime's classic blue/red/silver paint scheme. There's a bit of brownish-gray
thrown in, however, and though it's not a major color in this mode so it's
not a huge detail, I don't know why they did it-- Animated Prime never
had that color on him. Prime is also lacking some paint detailing on some
vital parts-- the sides of his bumper are painted silver, but not the top
or the headlights-- he REALLY needs those headlights painted. It appears
that most of the paint apps went to painting the top half of his cab mode
light red (it's not colored plastic), which is an odd choice-- why mold
the plastic in a completely different color than you want it to be? This
is the first time the mold sprue has been used, so it's not like they shouldn't
have planned for the plastic colors to be laid out as they are. This also
makes it a rather odd, abrupt transition between the top half of the cab
(red) and the bottom half of the cab (blue) since there isn't much of the
silver stripe along the side of the cab to help with that transition.

    Prime's robot mode looks
some weird kind of amalgam between his G1 and Animated forms-- the aesthetic
is clearly there in the legs and chest, but due to the small scale and
the tabs &amp; whatnot needed the rest of his body looks relatively normal
and blocky in its proportions. It's odd seeing Animated Prime with an almost
G1-ish head. The brownish gray is more obvious in this mode, what with
his entire stomach being that color, with no paint apps, which not only
is not show-accurate but just looks really odd and ugly. Another odd design
decision is that Prime's feet are molded at an angle to his feet, so has
to adopt a rather wide stance to stand properly in this mode. There are
also some pretty blantant wheels hanging off his arms (along with some
oddly large tabs, though the rest of his body looks alright. He can move
at the hips, ankles, elbows (at two points), and shoulders, and he can
also swivel mid-chest due to his transformation. No knee articulation though,
even though there's certainly nothing design-wise that would prevent him
from having any. The posability in his arms is also more limited than it
sounds due to the arms' bulkiness.

    Animated...Universe...
whatever Optimus Prime's Legends class toy has a few nice points, like
the nice detailing, generally good color scheme and nicely sculpted legs
in robot mode, but he suffers from way too many minor problems (such as
kibble in both modes and lack of paint detailing in important areas) that
all add up and make it hard for me to recommend him to any but the most
die-hard Legends or Animated fans. Get pretty much any other version of
Animated Prime instead, even if you have to pay more-- it's worth it.
