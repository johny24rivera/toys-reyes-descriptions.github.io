    Dreadwing, another of
the Decepticon drones from the
    <a href="tfmovieps2.html">
     console Transformers
movie game
    </a>
    to get his own toy, has the alternate mode of a jet. For
the most part, this mode looks pretty nice. There's plenty of mold detailing,
with panels and "rivets" molded everywhere, a cockpit molded inside the
transparent plastic on the nosecone, and even some robotic-style detailing
on the underside of the wings, which are more visible in robot mode. The
arctic/urban camo looks fairly nice, and all the colors fit together alright,
with the bits of purple used to give Dreadwing a bit of variety so he doesn't
look so monochrome. It's not particularly mind-blowingly awesome of a color
scheme, but not bad, either. There are two major problems I have with this
mode, however-- the first is that Dreadwing has some pretty darned obvious
robot kibble hanging off his underside in this mode. I suppose some of
it could be explained off as a huge missile that's permanently attached
to his underside, as his robot legs SORT of look like that in their particular
configuration on his underside in this mode, but his upper arms, located
under the sides of the main body, don't look like anything and just give
Dreadwing way too much girth down there when he should look more aerodynamic.
Also, although I love the way Dreadwing's two spring-loaded missile launchers--
which are his exhaust engines-- double as "jet plumes" in this mode, his
missiles fire WAY too easily, to the point where it gets so annoying you
just want to leave them out of their ports.

    Dreadwing's robot mode
is just plain doofy-looking, with absolutely ridiculous proportions. His
legs and waist are ludicrously tiny, his arms too long, and his head is
one of the most ridiculous designs I've seen on a Transformer. There's
nothing wrong with a monocle-optic head, considering that he's a drone
and all, but having the entire nosecone sitting behind the head looks...
really weird. His chest splitting apart to make it wider in this mode is
pretty cool, though, as is the piece on each wing that flip out a little
bit to make the wings a bit less irregular in shape-- both are completely
unnecessary, but really help Dreadwing fit in with the movie aesthetic.
(The widening of the chest, by the way, is Dreadwing's "automorph" feature--
it happens by itself as you swing Dreadwing's lower body into its proper
robot mode position.) I also like how the sides of his "exhaust port-hands"
can slide open and closed a little, giving him a little bit of claw articulation--
another unnecessary, but appreciated design aspect. Dreadwing's articulation
is fair, most of it being concentrated in his legs-- he can move at the
neck, shoulders (at two points), two claws on each hand, waist, hips (at
two points), and knees (at two points). His elbow articulation is really
wonky, however, really limited his movement in that area. Because of the
construction of those parts and the transformation, he can only move his
lower arms INWARD at the elbow, and not up, back, or outwards. Considering
that he's supposed to be able to aim his missiles before they fire, and
he can't do this very well, this point of articulation is missed more than
most would be. Also, if you move his shoulders back, you also have to move
his wings back as well, which can look rather odd-- other than that caveat,
though, all of the vehicle mode extras tend to work pretty well with the
look of this mode.

    Dreadwing is the worst
mainline movie mold, in my opinion, with a decent vehicle mode (even if
does have a lot of undercarriage), and a really horrible-looking robot
mode in nearly every aspect-- easily the worst-looking robot mode out of
any of the mainline movie toys. Not recommended except for completists.

      Dreadwing isn't terribly intelligent,
so no one's certain where he got the teleportation technology that allows
him to warp up to two and a half miles instantly. He sure didn't invent
it himself and no one else has it, so he must have stolen it, which makes
sense. He is, after all, a born thief. Sneaky and greedy, he pranks and
steals from his fellow Decepticons as often as the Autobots. No one likes
him, so he spends most of his time alone, plotting grand schemes and spiking
other robots' gas tanks with sugar.
