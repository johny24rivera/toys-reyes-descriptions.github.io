    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Hunters
Blight toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Rot Gut's color scheme
is pretty much what you'd expect from his name-- this guy looks toxic.
His primary colors are a shade of acid-like moderately light green, and
a sort of peaish greenish yellow. Both colors complement each other quite
well, though just a bit more of contrast between both of these colors--
particularly since they're so prominent on the toy-- would have been appreciated.
That said, the accent colors are what help to make this scheme; the blue
paint on Blight's claws/heels, knees/elbows, and on the chest is a really
nice shade-- still fairly light, but dark enough to contrast against Rot
Gut's main colors. There's also a nice bit of black-- used for Rot Gut's
wonderfully-named "Aflliction Hammer" weapon, as well as his beast toes--
which adds a much-needed dark color to the scheme to keep Rot Gut from
looking TOO bright. Honestly, I think using black on the top "fin" in beast
mode or the beast face instead of a spray paint app of the already-prevalent
greenish yellow on that head would have worked better. Rot Gut's eyes in
both modes are both a really nice dark red, which just pops against the
surrounding colors, even if it's used so little that it doesn't contribute
much to the color scheme itself. (Paitning his robot eyes seperate instead
of as a visor was also a good choice to help distinguish Rot Gut a bit
more.)

     Rot Gut is one of the
more imaginative redecos to come along in the Prime toyline. As opposed
to just a differently-colored Blight, giving the character an acidic, poisonous
look and then topping that off with a couple of great accent colors like
the blue and black really helps make the toy its own character in spite
of being a straight redeco. This is another end-of-the-line redeco that
wasn't distributed at all in the U.S., which is a real shame because I
think this is the best, most unique color scheme on any version of this
mold (even if they could've added a bit more paint detail to the beast
head).
