    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Ironhide toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Movie Voyager Ironhide toy

     Ironhide's "Offroad"
repaint is filled to the brim with ALLSPARK POWAH! electric blue, and has
a very interesting and unique color scheme on top of it. The dominant color,
dark metallic blue, makes a really nice base color and is fairly realistic,
while still looking good against the Allspark Power light blue that is
a prerequisite for all the Allspark Power toys. The gray makes a nice secondary
shade on the toy, with the gray actually being two slightly different shades
to mix things up a bit and keep it from just being the same light milky
gray that's been used on a LOT of the movie toys. The accent colors--and
there's tons of them-- look great as well, with plenty of electric Allspark
Power blue being used in all the right places, from his guns to his chest
plate to his vehicle mode lights-- it contrasts very well with its surrounding
colors, and it's not used so much in one place that it looks gaudy. I also
like the addition of a few spots of dull yellow in robot mode-- it makes
the color scheme a bit more original, and goes well with the dark blue
and black. Another detail I'm particularly fond of on Offroad Ironhide
is the brownish gray "mud splatters" on the back ends of his tires, which
look quite realistic and are a nice, unexpected detail.

     No mold changes have
been made to Offroad Ironhide, though the peg that connects to his roof/windshield
parts that go on his back in robot mode seems even more loose on this toy
than on the original Ironhide, so it can get pretty annoying the way it
constantly falls off.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Offroad Ironhide-- with
the exception of the aforemtnioned loose peg-- is superior to the original
in very way, in my opinion. Though it's a good mold regardless, Offroad
Ironhide takes the original's "black, black, and more black" color scheme
and REALLY spices it up with some really nice Allspark Power-y colors that
go extremely well together and tons of paint apps. Highly recommended.

       Infused with the power of the AllSpark,
this old warrior feels like he just rolled off the production line. Its
great to feel young again, and with the war over, Ironhide feels free to
indulge his wild side in the mountains and deserts of Earth. Together with
his new human friends, hes having the time of his life conquering the
most challenging trails on the planet, from Death Valley to the darkest
Amazon basin. Of course, if something gets in the way he cant drive over,
well, he can just blast his way through it with his newly supercharged
weapons systems. No one said the end of the war meant he never got to blow
stuff up again.
