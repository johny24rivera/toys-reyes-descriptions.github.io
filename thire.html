    Lieutenant Thire's alt
mode is the humongous Republic attack cruiser, the precursor to the Star
Destroyer on the classic trilogy. The mold detailing on this mode is the
most interesting aspect of it, as it's COVERED in mechanical detailing
to make it look huge. Unfortunately, it's not-- it's just your standard
price-point SWTF, but actually one of the smallest even considering that.
He's quite tiny for the price and when compared to other SWTFs at the same
price point. And although I wouldn't call it a mech mode "extra", if you
look at the mode from a directly side on view you can see a bit of his
mech chest poking out from the bottom of the vehicle-- heck, flip it over
and you'll see Thire's mech mode pretty much laid out there on the bottom
of this mode. He's got an easy transformation.There's a bit of dark maroon
and dark gray "highlighting" amongst all the gray to give him a bit of
visual variety color-wise, but it's minimal and typical Star Wars colors,
so it'll hardly stand out on your shelf. Pressing down on a small button
on the attack cruiser's tower will fire a spring-loaded missile, which
can also be stored on the underside of the vehicle mode if you don't want
a huge missile sticking out of the tower.

    In mech mode, Lieutenant
Thire gets a pretty straightforward body structure, with most of the parts
of the vehicle mode fitting in quite well to the overall look-- parts of
the Republic attack cruiser form the shoulder pads, and others a neat "skirt"
around his waist. The parts that form his legs also do so while keeping
in proportion with the rest of the "core" mech mode, and fit in quite well.
There are some pieces of his vehicle mode that just hang off the back,
unfortunately, and either don't peg into anything or have very shallow
pegs that don't really fit together well. However, at least these couple
of pieces stay out of the way of articulation. As for his articulation
itself, Thire can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows
(at three points), wrists, hips (at two places), knees (at two places),
and ankles (at two places). In general, his arms have considerably more
movement than his legs, which also look overly stiff, which doesn't help.
His arms, though, aren't broad enough at the shoulders, and just sort of
slump there, unfortunately. His waist can also theoretically turn-- there's
a joint there-- but the back kibble prevents it from moving much more than
a centimeter or so in either direction. Thire's color scheme throws in
the standard white, dark gray/black, and dark maroon into the mix, thereby
adding a BIT more color variety to this figure, but hardly enough to make
him exactly stand out on a shelf. His mold detailing, while good (particularly
on the head), doesn't have the detailing to it to make it look the mammoth
size it would be consider its alt mode. As for his weapon, the tower part
of his alt mode becomes a handheld missile launcher in this mode.

    Lieutenant Thire isn't
a bad SWTF by any means-- his vehicle mode is very solid (though essentially
a brick), and his robot mode, while it has a few pieces of mildly annoying
alt mode parts hanging off his back, is a solid design too. It's just,
well, boring. It doesn't have an interesting transformation, an interesting
proportion, or anything of the sort. Another named clone trooper with nothing
original to add to the Star Wars Transformers line. If you're a collector
of this line, than by no means is this one to skip; but if you only collect
the best designs, this one's probably worth passing up.

      Lieutenant Thire prepares his squad
of clone troopers aboard the Republic attack cruiser. Vulture droids and
droid bombers are attacking Coruscant, and it is Thire's mission to stop
them. Thire activates the cruiser's morphing technology and changes the
ship into a mammoth mech that drives back the swarming aerial droids.
