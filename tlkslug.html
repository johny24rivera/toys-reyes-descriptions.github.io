    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE deluxe
Dinobot Slug toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original AoE deluxe Slug toy

     Well, for his TLK redeco,
Hasbro I guess was a bit stumped. After his original dark blue deco, they
did him in
     <a href="aoeg1dinobots.html">
      G1 colors
     </a>
     , then in
     <a href="dinobotsunleashed.html">
      movie-accurate
colors
     </a>
     ... what now? I guess just make up a new one that isn't really
accurate at all! Slug still has a general "blue" theme to his color scheme,
in that most of his plastic is a light, pale pastel blue-- not really accurate,
but hey, not that bad-looking either. The main contrasting color to the
light blue-- particularly in beast mode-- is gold. For the plastic of course,
it's not REALLY a gold color, but rather a tannish brown with a goldish
hue to it. It's juust that shade of plastic I might be worried about succumbing
to Gold Plastic Syndrome, if Hasbro hadn't seemed to have solved that problem
by this point (Spoiler alert: I still worry about it). This plastic is
used for most of his main body, as well as the feet and lower robot legs.
So all of the pieces the most important to the core of his structure, great!
Anyways, the slightly-more-gold paint is used really liberally in beast
mode and quite well to boot, with stripes on the face and nice "fade" patches
on the sides, rear legs, and tail. In robot mode, there's some bluish-black
plastic visible on his upper arms, fists, robot head, and upper legs, to
give the blue a nice dark color to both contrast and complement against
it-- this is one of the few instances where I think a more "impure" black
works better than straight black. There's also some silver visible in his
robot mode-- specifically on the chest, top of the head, and the knees.
There's also a little bit of that very bland light milky gray used on Slug,
but thankfully only on his bendy plastic parts (the tail, weapons, and
jaw/horns). Finally, a bit of red pokes through on his beast eyes and robot
visor-- it looks particularly good on the visor, some great contast there.

     No mold changes have
been made to TLK Slug.

     The TLK redeco of Slug
isn't really accurate to or an homage to anything, and he wasn't in the
movie for more than a couple of seconds, so it's kind of a nonsensical
repaint in a short line that honestly couldn't spare the slots. That said,
the color scheme itself is pretty nice overall and fairly unique-- about
on
par with his original AoE color scheme. However, the gold plastic on the
core of the toy worries me, even if Hasbro has supposedly fixed that--
as such, I'd recommend this release the least out of the various color
schemes this mold has had.
