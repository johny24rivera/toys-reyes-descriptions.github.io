   : Originally planned
for release in the
   <a href="bmbfts.html">
    Beast Machines: Battle for the
Spark
   </a>
   line, Megatron Megabolt was cancelled at the last minute. Luckily,
the mold was finally released a year later to fill out the end of the Robots
in Disguise line, and again in late 2003 as just Megabolt.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original version of
Megatron Megabolt. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Megatron Megabolt

     This version of Megabolt
is what I like to call the "technorganic" version. Namely because it kinda
resembles what the big head looked like at the end of the last episode
of Beast Machines. It's very jungle-y in its nature; forest green and watery
blue, with some gold thrown in for good measure. The silver paint apps
here and there and the black also help to add to the color scheme. None
of his paint apps have changed from the previous version, though, which
shows that not much thought was put into that area. In fact, not much thought
seems to have been put into the color scheme in general, because although
this scheme would have been GREAT for a technorganic Maximal- like, say,
Optimus Primal- it just doesn't work on a big futuristic robotic head.
I can think of at least a dozen schemes that would have worked well, and
the original scheme was much better. (At least they finally stamped a Decepticon
symbol over his Vehicon spark crystal this time, though.)

     No mold changes have
been made to Megabolt. Yes, he still has those darn floppy knees...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Megabolt is a very nice
toy mold-wise, but the color scheme just doesn't fit the toy this time
around. Only recommended if you can't find the original version.
