    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Plasma Punch Bumblebee.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Plasma Punch Bumblebee

     Out of all the FAB repaints,
Rally Rocket Bumblebee is definitely the least "repainted". Yellow is still
is primary color, though it's a noticeably lighter, more primary shade
of yellow than the orangish yellow used on Plasma Punch Bumblebee. There's
more black to offset the brighter color, though, particularly in vehicle
mode. The black wide stripe down the top of Bumblebee looks particularly
cool, and in keeping with his new racing-themed deco, this version of Bumblebee
has really cool back-to-back "BB"s on his hood and on his car doors. It's
a really slick logo, and quite creative as well. In robot mode, Bumblebee's
secondary colors are two different shades of blue, one being pale light
and the other having a greenish tint. It's not something I would've thought
went well with yellow, but in these small amounts it works surprisingly
well while still letting Bumblebee keep his characteristic "yellow and
black" color scheme. One of the few things I do not like about this new
scheme, though, are the yellow tires. I mean... yellow tires? Seriously?
His missile is also colored a dull light blue, which just doesn't cut the
mustard as a decent color for a projectile. It should have been transparent,
or something.

     Rally Rocket Bumblebee
is an ever-so-slight improvement over the first use of the mold, but his
color scheme is overall so similar to Plasma Punch Bumblebee's I wouldn't
bother with this version if you've already got the original unless you're
either a completist or a huge Bumblebee fan. Rally Rocket Bumblebee's color
scheme, though using a bit lighter shade of yellow, overall is more varied
and the colors just mesh slightly better.

       With most of the Decepticons taken care
of, Bumblebee is ready to enjoy himself. The best way he can think of to
do that is to show his human friends a thing or two on the race track.
With his engine tuned and his new paint sparkling in the sun, he's ready
for anything the other racers can think of. And if the Decepticons decide
to attack, well, he's keep his plasma cannon polished just for them.
