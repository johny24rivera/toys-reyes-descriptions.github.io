    Skyfire's vehicle mode
is a jet. I'm not exactly an ace when it comes to identifying different
types of jets, so I don't know what kind, but suffice itto say that it's
a bit sleeker than
    <a href="windsheer.html">
     Wind Sheer's
    </a>
    . The nose
is rather pointed (or, at least, as pointed as it's going to get on a toy),
and the tailfin's pretty stylish too. There are two Decepticon emblems
on him, one on each wing, and the gray, black, and purple go together EXTREMELY
well on this 'bot. The orange cockpit, although not very realistic, goes
nicely with the rest of the toy as well. The little mini pull-out landing
gears are a nice touch too. The only thing that ruins this mode, though-
and it's quite a bit letdown- is the rather blatant robot arms and legs
sticking out of the bottom. They can easily be seen from any angle except
directly above. This rather detracts from the overall "sleekness" of the
rest of the plane mode, and makes it very obvious that Skyfire is a "robot
in disguise".

    Skyfire's robot mode,
however, is awesome. It's very posable, with posability in the head, elbows,
shoulders, knees, and upper legs. Instead of being just "extras", his wings
on his back and his cockpit on his chest actually complement the robot
mode rather than hinder it. Like his partner in design, Wind Sheer, Skyfire
has his weapon stored in two halves in the back of his legs. This way,
you can either take one half out to make a short gun, or connect both halves
together to form a longer "sniper" gun. Very nice. Skyfire's robot mode
is also very well-done and inhuman looking. The visor-eye and the absence
of a mouth look very cool. The "light piping" effect also works very well
in Skyfire.

    Although his plane mode
may not be the best due to the robot extras on the bottom, Skyfire's robot
mode is very, very nice for a toy his size. Many people like Wind Sheer
a bit better than Skyfire, because of the color scheme, but I personally
see it the other way around. Skyfire's color scheme blends seamlessly together
to make him very appealing to the eye.

      You can always count on Skyfire to get
the job done. He is totally dedicated to Megatrons evil plans, and is
as unswerving in his loyalty to the Decepticons as he is straight and true
in his jet flights. Skyfires strength and determination make him look
like one big, mean flying machine when hes coming in to strafe Autobots
into crumbled bits of sheet metal.
