not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Downshift. For

     "Slice" here is based
on Slicer, a redeco of Action Master Wheeljack released only in Europe
in that "almost G2" period in 1991 when Transformers had stopped being
released in the states for that one sole year. What's also interesting
about this guy is that, though he has large Decepticon symbols painted
on the sides of his vehicle mode, his molded-on Autobot symbol on his chest
is painted purple-- this is because this color scheme, on this mold, was
also used in the "Shattered Glass" fiction to represent Shattered Glass
Wheeljack. So, now this toy can function as both G2-Redux Slicer AND Shattered
Glass Wheeljack! Pretty cool idea, there. As for the toy itself, it's pretty
faith to the original in terms of color scheme. The dark blue is the really
stand-out color, in a particular glittery, semi-metallic shade that really
catches the eye. The red goes quite well with the blue, too, and the couple
of bronze bits on robot mode also work quite nicely with the overall scheme.
Unfortunately, his blue is such a dark shade that the black really doesn't
do much for me except when you've got the bronze coloration contrasting
with it. But my biggest complaint with Slice's color scheme is the extraordinary
dull milky brownish-gray plastic used for most of his small "inner robot"
parts, like his upper legs, lower arms, and feet. It's just a really bleh
color in any situation, but it doesn't really go all that great with any
of Slicer's other colors. The dark transparent red, although decent enough,
could have been a few shades lighter to make his light piping work a bit
better. As far as paint apps go, Slicer has a fair number of them, though
nothing extraordinary. The front half of his car mode, as well as his robot
chest, look the best with all those details working together against the
main dark blue color.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon 2010 Slice. Of note is that in addition to being a
Botcon 2010 exclusive, Slice was only available ("free") if you bought
the expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked the set up in person
at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt going to be worth quite a lot
of money.

     Botcon 2010 Slice's
main selling point is his super-obscure nature, plus his really dynamite-looking
glittery dark blue color. Plus, he's the only toy from this years' set
that I would actually consider DULL as opposed to normal or obnoxiously
loud, so if you're more a fan of these types of color schemes, love Shattered
Glass, or just gotta have a toy from this years' set but don't want a loud
color scheme, this may be right up your alley... so long as you're willing
to pay a lot for it, given its really exclusive nature.

       Most Decepticons make violence their
vocation, others see it as an art or a means to an end. For Slice, violence
is everything. When confronted with a problem, he leaps into battle, lashing
out with every weapon at his disposal until either he or his enemy is a
smoldering wreck, even if that enemy is an uncooperative door. He loves
smashing Autobots and humans but when confronted by other Decepticons,
has a quick temper born of petty cruelty.

       Slice followed Breakdown to Earth looking
for new and interesting forms of ultra-violence. His Neuro-Centre Control
Unit burned out after he landed in Toulon, France, sticking him with a
thick French accent. He doesn't mind. It gives him an excuse to start fights
with friends and foes alike.
