    Vehicle mode is a stealth
bomber. This mode looks VERY nice. Besides the usual excellent mechanical
detailing and style, the entire main body has a dusting of reddish brown
over it, giving it an "old" and rusty feel. Very nice! Besides the Vehicon
spark crystal on the tab on the top of the bomber, there's also a Vehicon
insignia painted on the topside of one wing and the underside of the other
(why they did this instead of just painting both on the top side, I don't
know). Although I would have preferred that the very dark army green was
replaced with black to give it a bit more of a "stealth" feel, it's not
that big of a deal. There are a few minor problems with this mode, however;
for one, it has none articulation whatsoever. Zip, zero, zilch, nada. That's
not really that big of a problem when you consider planes can't really
move much, but all the other Vehicons have some kind of wheels or vehicle-heads,
where this one actually resembles an actual bomber. Also, Spy Streak's
upper legs are a bit visible from a back view, and the robot legs themselves
don't completely connect to the sides of the jet, leaving a small gap in
between the main body of the bomber and its wings, which doesn't make it
look "solid" from a directly-above view. Because of the missiles below
the cockpit, Spy Streak's plane mode also looks slightly odd from a side
view. Still, these are all rather minor nitpicks, and it's still a great
mode. By pushing the spark-crystal tab forward (HARD), you can fire the
two missiles. Unfortunately, it also splits the cockpit in half temporarily
(for use in the robot mode), which looks rather odd in this mode.

    Robot mode looks REALLY
cool, too. His ankle joints are a bit too tight, however, so they may occasionally
pop off during the transformation. Spy Streak is carrying a double-missile
launcher in one "hand" and a friggin' HUGE claw in the other (made by keeping
the spark-tab mentioned before in a locked position). The claw is actually
about as tall as Spy Streak himself! The missiles in the missile launcher
can be fired individually in this mode, by pressing (very) small tabs on
its underside. They're very sensitive, though, so be careful. However,
Spy Streak's "hands" in this mode are really just his intake valves in
plane mode, so they don't really look like hands at all. Also, his claw
and missile launcher can't detach, which is a real bummer. Because of this,
it rather limits Spy Streak's arm articulation because of his bulky lower
arms. Because of Spy Streak's rather skinny legs, he also has a slightly
hard time standing up in this mode, since he's top-heavy. Still, the overall
design and look is great in this mode, and the head looks awesome and very
fitting.

    A great Vehicon in both
modes, with an especially sweet robot mode. Highly recommended.

      Spy Streak is entirely focused on one
task: destroy the Maximals. Impressive aerial abilities and a fully stocked
arsenal make him a serious threat on all fronts. Bomber mode has two powerful
laser-matrix missiles with remote detonation capabilities. Robot mode is
equipped with a giant and powerful clamp mechanism perfect for close-in
hand-to-hand combat and makes a valuable utility tool. Specialized armor
deflects most energy blasts plus radar detection. One of Jetstorm's most
valuable assets, Spy Streak never backs down from a fight.
