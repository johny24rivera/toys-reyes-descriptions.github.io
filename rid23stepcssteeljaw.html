    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Steeljaw toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     "Cybertron Strike" Steeljaw
isn't so much a full-blown redeco of the original 3-step version, but more
of a variant with some different paint details. The base colors of pale
milky blue and a very light milky gray are the same here-- maybe the very
light gray here is just shade or so even lighter, more towards the white
end of the spectrum-- it's hard to tell. The black plastic is also in the
same parts, and the charcoal black paint is largely in the same areas--
on the windows, kneecaps, toes, and part of the waist, though for this
version it's only on the top of this area, more on the abs than on the
waist itself. The charcoal black paint is missing from the tops of the
claw on each hand, but honestly that looked kinda weird anyways, I'm glad
it's gone. The orange highlights from the original have now been replaced
with a dark red on the headlights and wheel hubs, though such paint is
missing from the little lights on the front hood. There's also some dark
red on circuitry-like lines on the abs and knees. The most obvious changes
are twofold; first, there's silver circuitry-like details on several parts,
in a similar pattern to
     <a href="rid23steppsbee.html">
      Power Surge Bumblebee
     </a>
     .
He's got such circuitry paint apps on his shoulders and front hood, along
with a bit more silver on the inside bits on the shoulders. The other major
difference is the face, which still has the same yellow eyes, but is painted
MUCH more accurately to the show model, with silver on the face and a bit
of very light gray/white paint on the front of the ears. This looks MUCH
better than the more prevalent light gray paint apps on the original's
face. In a bit of a give-and-take, the extra paint apps on the ears mean
there's no gray-white paint on the sides of the front hood piece.

     Cybertron Strike Steeljaw
is, more-or-less, the original 3-step changer, but with some neat silver
circuitry paint apps and a more accurately-painted face. Both of these
are positives, so I'd recommend this version slightly over the original,
but they're so similar if you DO already have the original, you don't really
need to bother with this version.
