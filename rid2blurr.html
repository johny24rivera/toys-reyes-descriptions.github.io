    Blurr's alternate mode
is a race car with a surprisingly realistic-sized cockpit. As you'd expect
for such a vehicle, he's very streamlined and curvy, with little mold detailing.
Even for a RID2015 toy, it's fairly minimal beyond the bare basics-- even
his headlights are pretty simple shapes, and his (unpainted) taillights
are of a similar shape, along with a couple of ridges on the back end and
a nice little mini "nose" on the front end. There's also a small bump above
the roof, where you can plug in Blurr's gun if you so desire, and a spoiler
on the back end. As far as robot extras go, there aren't really any visible--
even the rear end looks solid. That is, that WOULD be the case, except
for the fact that his cockpit (and his gun) are a very light pale transparent
blue, and you can see the entire robot waist and upper legs inside there!
Ugh, this is definitely one of those instances where they should've just
painted the windows if they weren't going to mold in a car interior; it
doesn't look good, especially since it's such a large window. As for the
rest of the color scheme, the base plastic of much of Blurr in this mode
is white, but it's painted over with a very generous amount of semi-metallic
sky blue, which looks great overall. The thing is, there is a couple of
bits of this same color used but cast in plastic (where the car doors would
be, as well as the middle of the back end), and the plastic is noticeably
duller, making for a a minor color mismatch here. There's also a REALLY
nice shade of dark milky blue which really catches the eye and is used
mostly for the tires in this mode, and is painted on the spoiler. Additionally,
there's a bit of light blue painted on Blurr's headlights. Given how he's
pretty much all white and blue, these colors both contrast and complement
each other, and of course make Blurr a bit of a throwback to his G1 colors,
even if this is based the Rescue Bots character, not the G1 character.

    To transform Blurr to
robot mode, separate the back side thirds from the body and turn arond
the car doors, which become his arms (also flip up the spoilers so they're
on top of the shoulders). The feet flip down and rotate forward from underneath
the front hood, and then the big step is you just take the entire cockpit
and roof section and rotate it all back behind the body of the mode, and
that's pretty much it other than separating the front halves to become
the lower legs. The limbs thus look fairly familiar in this mode given
how dominant of a role they played in the vehicle mode, though I love those
car front details now on Blurr's lower legs, and the spoilers give his
already big shoulders even more mass. His proportions are largely pretty
good-- keeping in mind the large shoulders, which help enhance his character
silhouette and aren't stupidly big or anything. There is some vehicle kibble,
and it's his entire cockpit window and roof folded behind his back-- granted,
the roof portion is mostly folded against the back and doesn't stick out
much, but the window definitely does a fair amount, and it doesn't peg
in anywhere securely either, though at least it stays in the same general
area that it should. At least such a large piece framing his entire body
is transparent. As far as mold detailing, Blurr stays pretty smooth, though
his body does the RID2015 usual of having faux detailing on it that makes
it look like his hood is crumpled up for the chest, and there's some general
angular details on his abs and waist. His facesculpt is round with a forehead
vent down the center like Bumblebee, and he's got a rather large visor
with a notch down the center to make it more obvious where each eye is.
His face has a bit of a smirk to it, and he's got a small chin guard. The
light piping for the visor works VERY well, though I wish the color was
a bit more blue instead of almost plain clear to make it more impressive.
As for his colors, there's a bit more dark blue in this mode, more visible
on his upper legs, abs, and kneecaps, with the latter two spots painted
and looking VERY nice and metallic. His body is mostly the duller sky blue
plastic, but with the white now separating it from the painted limbs, the
color discrepancy isn't as obvious here as in vehicle mode. There's some
nice added stripes to his chest and abs in this mode, and the helmet on
his head is painted sky blue. For articulation in this mode, Blurr can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points) elbows, hips (at two points),
knees, and ankles (at two points). I wish he had waist rotation, and the
hips are pretty loose (at least on my copy), but otherwise you couldn't
ask for much more in this respect.

    RID2015 warrior Blurr
is a pretty solid toy, with a very nice vehicle mode (though I really wish
his window wasn't transparent so we couldn't see so much of his robot mode
inside), a pretty nice robot mode (though with one big piece of kibble
behind his back), and a fairly simple transformation that still accomplishes
a lot. Unlike a lot of RID2015 toys, his paint apps are fairly generous,
and most of his colors are a nice metallic shade, with white making for
an excellent contrast color. If you're going to get a version of RID2015
Blurr, unless you're getting it for someone who can only handle
