    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Hot Shot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Goldbug is pretty much
exactly what I expected a "mirror universe" Autobot to look like-- i.e.,
the colors were flipped. In G1 Goldbug was an upgraded form of Bumblebee,
and so had the same colors-- yellow with some black. Well, now he's mostly
black with some yellow, and he looks GREAT, particularly on the fantastic
Cybertron Hot Shot mold. The yellow black-bordered stripes in vehicle mode
look utterly fantastic against the black, and they work just as well in
robot mode, as well. So that Goldbug wasn't just two colors, though, a
few more colors were added into the mix. The metallic silver is a particularly
shiny, metal-y shade of that color, and would look good on almost any toy,
Goldbug being no exception. The dark blue is my favorite of the accent
colors, though, as it adds a little something to the robot mode that the
vehicle mode, for the most, didn't have, and also goes extremely well with
the other colors. I think the whole she-bang looks especially good with
all the colors coming together on the chest.

     Goldbug is one of the
'08 exclusives to get a new head mold as well, and it looks pretty good-
spot-on G1 Goldbug, but with a bit more menacing of a glare somehow that
works perfectly for an evil Autobot.

     Botcon Goldbug is one
of my favorite '08 exclusives, and is exactly how I think all of the '08
exclusives should have been done-- obviously the G1 character it was meant
to be, but with a unique, fantastic color scheme (in this case, a "mirror"
color scheme, with a few accent colors added to spice thing sup). Also
kudos for using the more obscure Goldbug instead of the umpteenth version
of Bumblebee for the character. (And, let's face it, "Bumblebee" just doesn't
sound evil at all.)

       Goldbug was once a young Cybertronian
drifter known as Bumblebee. He survived on the streets of Polyhex with
no real purpose. Over time, he became skilled at sneaking around, stealing,
eavesdropping and blackmailing. When he heard of a new cause being led
by Optimus Prime, he eagerly joined the Autobots n hopes of finding a place
to belong and where his unsavory activities would be tolerated. When the
war began, Bumblebee showed extreme bravery in battle and often sought
ways to be noticed by command. In time, he worked his way up the ranks
of the Autobots and when the Autobot Seeker Drench was destroyed, Bumblebee
was offered an upgraded form and a new identity as Goldbug, to take his
place. Although he holds a high position in the Autobot hierarchy, he is
paranoid that someone will one day try to betray him and take his place
as he has done to so many others in the past.
