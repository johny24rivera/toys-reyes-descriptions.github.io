    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to PotP Vector Prime/Metalhawk.

     Alpha Trion is the first
remold done for the Prime Master sets in Power of the Primes, though you'd
be forgiven for not immediately noticing because the most notable features
of Landmine are new, plus so much of the design of the Prime Master sets
is shared between them all anyways. Regardless, in robot mode Alpha Trion
shares all the same (generic) details that Vector Prime does, from the
rather normal head to the rather normal arms to the rather normal feet
details. The body and feet are an orangish "cheesy" shade of yellow-- similar
to that of the many, many movie Bumblebee toys-- while the rest of him
is a slightly brownish, "dirty" shade of light gray. Although they fit
Landmine's color scheme and are vaguely construction-ish, it's still not
a good color scheme. If you've been following my reviews for a while, you
know I'm not the biggest fan of yellow, and this dirty shade of gray doesn't
look that great either. They don't outright clash, but the colors just
don't work for me. The only paint app in robot mode is on Alpha Trion's
face, where you get a bit more of that orangish-yellow paint on him. Otherwise
there's no paint in this mode. Alpha Trion does have a new "core mode"
front, though, similar to how a Titan Master could have a new face molded
into them. For Alpha Trion, there's some rather regal details molded around
the outside-- some angular yet symmetrical details that almost look like
a crown at the top and almost like teeth on the bottom with some divots
in them. In the center are.... nine pink diamonds, themselves arranged
in a diamond pattern? This is by far the most obscure of all the Prime
Master symbols, I'm not sure what the heck this symbol has to do with Alpha
Trion's power of knowledge and history. (It should be noted the top little
diamond is a bit slimmer than the others.) I'm not sure why they're pink,
either-- THIS color DOES clash with the brownish gray, and just looks very
out-of-place. It's just not that good of a core mode. But hey, if you want
to use it for a nine-eyed creepy face it does work pretty well.

     Most of Landmine is
re-used from Metalhawk-- in fact, everything is mold-wise except for the
front portion that folds down for a Prime Master to fit in. The back section
has all the same molded-in details as Metalhawk, as do the arms, and the
weapon that can either be held in the hands in Pretender mode or folded
out
to the front for weapon mode is the same long-barreled, single blaster
weapon used on Metalhawk. Of course, the colors have been changed, with
the main body being that orangish yellow and the arms and barrel being
the dirty light gray. Again, it's not a great color scheme, and unfortunately
there's no paint on the gun barrel this time either, so it looks rather
plain. What HAS been changed, though, helps give Landmine his own unique
look from the front in this mode. The details from his G1 Pretender mode--
another human in a robotic suit-- have been replicated here, though with
the "human" portion taken out and replaced with a little slit for the Prime
Master inside to look out of. Landmine's look is generally ruff'n'tuff
and angular, as befits his general "construction" color scheme. He's got
a gray "helmet", and what look like little missile pods on the shoulders.
There's several little circuitry and vent details on the chest, and he's
got a "work belt" with what look like quite alot of things in their own
pouches. In comparison, the leg details are rather curved, with angular
kneecaps. All of the paint apps for the Pretender mode are on this new
piece, with dark red on the kneecaps and stomach, and dark gray on the
helmet and belt. It helps give him at least a bit of color variety in this
mode, at least.

     If you're going to skip
one Prime Master set, I'd make it Alpha Trion/Landmine. For one, much of
it is remolded from one of the weakest Prime Masters there are (the Vector
Prime/Metalhawk set), only given a color scheme that is borderline ugly,
and doesn't really look all that hot. The Prime insignia for core mode
is rather nonsensical, and the Pretender mode is another "human in a suit",
which to me are the least exciting of the Pretender shells to try to replicate
here. Unless you're a Prime Master completist, I'd skip this one.
