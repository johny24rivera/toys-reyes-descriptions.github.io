    Being dead for two movies
doesn't keep ol' Blackout down, as he has a new mold toy just in time for
the third movie. In his helicopter mode, Blackout looks quite impressive,
especially for a Cyberverse-scaled toy, with proportions that are very
spot-on. You can see the robot hands sticking up rather blatantly in fromt
of the tailfin, but otherwise there's no robot mode extras in this mode.
His main rotor is also on three different levels horizontonally, due to
the transformation (two rotors are on each level so they can fold up under
each other for robot mode), but at most angles this is a minor issue at
best. Both his main and tail rotors can spin freely as well. His mold detailing
is incredibly well-done even for a movie toy, with teeny tiny panel lines
and windows detailed all over his form. The number of paint apps is pretty
decent, with important things like his front windows and engine detailed.
His side windows also could've used some paint, but realistically with
the amount of mold details in this mode some things had to be left out.
His overall color scheme of dull blue and gray is pretty... well... dull,
but it's of course accurate to the movie and doesn't outright clash. Blackout
has a clip at the back end of this mode where you can attach his teeny-tiny
partner Scorponok, though considering the scale Scorponok is far too small
to really have enough much paint or articulation himself to qualify as
a full-fledged extra figure (only his head has silver paint on it, though
he's got intricate mold detailing). Scorponok can move at two sections
along his tail, but that's it for his beast mode.

    Unfortunately, in robot
mode Blackout doesn't hold up nearly as well as he does in vehicle mode.
By far the biggest issue here is that the large side panels of the helicopter
mode hang off Blackout's shoulders a bit too far and serve as awkward intermediary
points for his "real" shoulders. The side panels also don't peg together,
meaning that if you rotate his "real" shoulders out you'll often get part
of the side panels rotating out on a back hinge with them, another annoyance.
On his lower arms there's also some helicopter kibble hanging off them--
it's not too bad for his left arm, but his right arm has the entire tail
rotor hanging off it as well, which is a big eyesore. His lower legs are
also too flat and two-dimensional, being very skinny from a side view.
On the plus side, his mold detailing is still just as incredible as ever,
particularly on his head. His long toes and heels give him pretty good
stability, and by themselves the proportions on the arms and upper legs
look pretty good. His main body is also pretty accurate and well-proportioned,
and the way his rotors fold over each other behind his back is pretty creative.
For articulation, Blackout can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), hips, knees (at two points), and at the ankles-- pretty
darned good movement for a toy of this size. Scorponok can kinda sorta
transform into a gun for Blackout to hold in this mode, though it's only
one in the loosest sense of the term-- a gun barrel folds out of Scorponok's
underbelly and then his tail pegs into the top side of it-- that's it.
It's not much, but it is better than having him simply do nothing.

    Dark of the Moon Blackout
pulls off a pretty nice vehicle mode, has incredible mold and decent paint
detailing, a good range of articulation, and a little partner. Scorponok
doesn't do much, but at this scale frankly I'm surprised he was included
at all. That said, Blackout's huge unwieldly shoulder pieces in robot mode
(which don't look good from any angle), as well as his two-dimensional
legs, are really off-putting and together drastically reduce the rating
I gave the figure. This is nice for a Cyberverse-scaled Blackout, I suppose,
but if you're going for looks I'd definitely just spring for one of the
several voyager versions of this design instead.

      Together with Scorponok, this massive

Blackout leaves no witnesses to his passing, preferring to destroy everything
around him rather than leave anything behind that might benefit the enemy.
