    Optimus Prime's back
with a new mold for this design in the voyager class, and in vehicle mode
it looks pretty accurate to the actual Western Star truck vehicle model.
The proportions are pretty spot-on, though the tires are perhaps a tad
small for a truck-- I mean, he does sit pretty low to the ground. The only
thing I would actually qualify as an extra is a bit of Optimus "skirt"
piece sticking out on the top of part of the rear section, and the edges
of his lower legs, which are otherwise covered up by the trailer hitch
piece above them. Still, for a design as seemingly impossible to make a
reality as Optimus' AoE/TLK model, that's pretty darned good. Plus, Optimus'
shield accessory can be pegged into his trailer hitch in this mode, covering
up even more of these minor extras. (His sword accessory is stored underneath
the bottom of this mode-- slid between two tabs.) Mold-wise, the detailing
is fairly sparse on the vehicle portions, as is correctly the case for
this model of a truck, at least in the front. The wheels have some pretty
good tread detailing, though, and there's quite a few lines on the tanks
on the sides, the trailer hitch area near the back, and the rear end, and
there's the appropriate vents 'n such on the nose and front grill. Color-wise
of course he's in your traditional Movie Prime colors, being predominatly
blue with some nifty red flame paint apps on the front nose and sides around
the cockpit. The blue plastic used for this toy is particuarly good-looking,
being of a milky, semi-metallic variety with quite a lot of glitter in
it-- thus making it about as close as unpainted plastic can get to an actual
truck chassis. There's also a bit of a painted metallic version of this
color around the front grill. The red is about half paint, half milky plastic
(that on the truck nose is mostly plastic). The front grill itself is painted
silver, along with the bit above the front window and the tanks along the
sides. Unfortunately, that all-too-prevalent, bland, light milky gray plastic
is back on this toy, used in this mode on the trailer hitch and smokestacks.
*sigh* Will Hasbro every stop using this awful color for its gray plastics?
Of course, there's also some black-- on the wheels, windows, and a bit
on some small connector pieces behind the front wheels.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
to robot mode is a bit more complex than most other TLK toys (even Premier
Edition ones), particularly when going from robot to vehicle as it requires
placing some parts in juust the right place initially, but the end result
is pretty worth it. Granted, there's still some kibble here-- the most
egregious of which are the sides of his front nose sticking out the sides
and back of his lower legs. There's also his truck doors sticking out of
his back a little, and his roof accordioned up behind that. However, the
rest of him is pretty movie-accurate and well-proportioned, which is pretty
amazing given the size class and this seemingly impossible design. The
mold detailing for all his robot bits is absolutely spot-on and very impressive--
there's a lot of little mechanical greebles all OVER his lower legs and
chest especially, but even on the "less detailed" parts like hos arms and
upper legs, there's lots of movie-accurate curved armor detailing and some
circuitry here and there, with movie-accurate shoulder caps and smokestacks
behind his upper back. His headsculpt is also spot-on accurate. Optimus'
color scheme loses most of the red in this mode, behind the bit on his
chest and on the sides of his legs. The blue is still pretty apparent,
but a dark gray is now present on his arms, upper legs, and the sides of
his chest, making him a bit darker in color. There's still some of that
blah light gray on his feet and sword, but it's relatively minor in this
mode. There is a nice amount of silver paint in this mode-- on the waist,
lower legs, biceps, and much of the chest-- but having it abruptly disappear
on some of the dark gray parts doesn't look right. Optimus' color doesn't
change suddenly there on the model, I'm not sure why they wouldn't want
a closer paint-plastic transition on this toy. Looks kinda weird, especially
on the chest. This is also apparent on his blue "collar" pieces, where
the front two are painted metallic blue but the last isn't, for some reason.
(There is some more metallic blue on his pecs and lower arms, which looks
nice.) It unfortunately makes Optimus look slightly unfinished, albeit
still with a lot more paint than most other TLK toys. Optimus' head also
has silver paint where appropriate, but the light blue paint apps on his
eyes are cartoonishly oversized, which unfortunately is a big deal since
this is right where your eyes normally go-- why didn't they get this right
and make those apps smaller to match the actual molded-in eye details?
Such an odd decision. There's also some light electric blue on the front
of much of his shield piece, which can either be held in his fists like
a gun or pegged into the side of either of his lower arms. His sword, which
has the blade painted a spiffy light orange, can either be held in a hand
or sheathed in a special slot behind his back. For articulation in this
mode, Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points, and two more
points on each outer "shoulder armor" piece), elbows, rotation at the waist,
and movement at the hips (at three points) and the knees. Some ankle movement
would've been appreciated, but otherwise he's very articulated and quite
poseable in this mode.

    TLK voyager Optimus
Prime still has some kibble issues-- such as the truck nose-bits behind
his lower legs and roof behind his back-- but overall, it's a much better
try at the design than his various AoE toys. His proportions are great
in both modes, his mold detailing fantastic when it needs to be, his articulation
is very nice, and the plastic used for his blue and red are of a particularly
awesome shade, even if he could've used a bit more silver paint in his
robot mode and better eye paint apps. A definite upgrade, and if you get
no other toy of this design, I'd make it this one (so long as you're old/patient
enough to handle the more complex transformation).
