    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Voyager Starscream toy

     As you'd expect, Movie
Starscream gets a Seeker repaint in the main movie line-- more specifically,
as Thundercracker. 'Cracker here has all the appropriate colors you'd expect
from a G1-inspired repaint, with dark blue and light gray taking up most
of the color scheme. I'd prefer more of the silver as opposed to light
gray, as it looks considerably better, but the light gray certainly isn't
bad and works very nicely as a light color against Thundercracker's otherwise
dark color scheme. The black and dark red also work very well as secondary
colors, making Thundercracker look considerably more interesting than the
original Movie Voyager Starscream. This goes particularly for the dark
red stripes on the wings of the vehicle mode, which may not be very realistic
but really help to liven up the alt mode and provide more contrast. Like
the G1 toy, Thundercracker also has a transparent orange cockpit, which
also looks quite nice against the other colors. Oh, and the silver Decepticon
symbols on the wings= big win.

     Thundercracker has the
same "G1/Movie combo" head that the
     <a href="movg1starscream.html">
      Target
Exclusive G1 redeco of Starscream
     </a>
     has-- as I mentioned in that review,
I think the G1 homage looks forced on this head mold, as the G1-style helmet
just doesn't fit the rest of the face or the mold at all.

     Movie Thundercracker
is a repaint of an admittedly medicore mold, but color-wise it's much better
than either version of this mold released in 2007. I don't like the new
head mold, but other than that he's better than the toy's original release
in every way.

       Thundercracker lives on fear. Special
materials in his vehicle body allow him to emit controlled sonic detonations
that can be heard 200 miles away. Cruising along at Mach 6, he wants his
enemies to hear him before they see him. He wants them to know he's coming,
and cower in fear at their impending doom. Not as devoted to the recovery
of the Allspark as the other Decepticons, he stays with Megatron because
the evil leader allows him to indulge his chaotic tendencies.
