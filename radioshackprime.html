    Optimus Prime's truck
mode is one of the less-accurate representations of his movie form, though
most of this can be explained away because of the small scale and because
of the included electronics. Still, the truck bed making up the rear half
of this mode is a bit too bulky proportionally. The heels of his robot
feet are also fairly obvious sticking out from the backside, though that's
a small quibble. Prime has plenty of mold detailing, with some nice flame
paint apps for such a small toy, though his red is a bit too pinkish--
I'm not sure why they didn't go with a duller red, as that would've made
the color scheme fit together perfectly. The mold detailing itself is pretty
much "only what's needed", though, which is unfortunate, though a few areas
like the front grill have a fair amount of detailing on them. Prime comes
with a handheld gun-shaped remote controller which, when activated, can
cause Prime to roll forwards and backwards in vehicle mode. When he backs
up, however, he backs up at an angle, so he can do more than just go back
and forth in a straight line, thank goodness. The controller itself is
actually quite cool, with Prime's main colors and a neat stylized version
of his name imprinted on the top of the handle, along with an Autobot symbol.
Prime can also clip onto the top of the controller when it's not in use.
Coolest of all, however, is the fact that the tip of the controller can
come off so it can double as a pen! Now THAT is creative, even making the
controller "transform" in a way.

    Optimus transforms in
the usual Spychanger manner-- unfortunately, in robot mode this makes him
look much more like G2 Laser Optimus Prime than Movie Prime.Â  In fact,
the only thing resembling Movie Prime at all in this mode is the face design.
Even the flat-nosed truck design on his chest is very G1-like, and not
reminiscient of the movie design at all. Being a Spychanger in design,
his articulation is also severely limited-- he can move back and forth
at the elbows, but that's it. His legs are also overly bulky proportionally,
due to the electronics housed in them.

    RC Micro Racer Optimus
Prime works fairly well as a remote-controlled miniature truck, but his
robot mode definitely isn't winning any awards and he's pretty darned pricey
for what you get. Only recommended if you're a
    <i>
     huge
    </i>
    fan of either
RC vehicles or Optimus Prime.
