    Vehicle mode is a cybertronian
motorcycle. This mode is fairly good, considering the small size of the
toy. The only major difference, at least design-wise, between this vehicle
mode and the show version's vehicle mode is that there is no "vehicle head"
on this version. Thus, it actually looks like Thrust is just crouching
down in this mode with his arms turned behind him (which is exactly what
it is, actually). Thrust's arms are also a bit too long and skinny proportionally,
and thus, in this mode, it makes the "engines" look too long.

    Robot mode is pretty
show-accurate, over all. The head is a bit too small proportionally, though,
and the rear vehicle wheel is rather evident in this mode, since it's stuck
in Thrust's midsection. Also, because Thrust's arms are rather long and
skinny, and because they can only move around where connected to the main
body section, Thrust always looks like he's running after something in
this mode, keeping him from assuming any sort of battle stance. What is
neat, though, is that even though Thrust can't stand up by himself in this
mode (his "leg" is just a wheel, as in the show), he comes with his own
stand! The stand is molded in a "smoke" pattern, to make it look like Thrust
is burning rubber! Very nice! Thrust's allegiance symbol is molded into
the transparent plastic on his upper right arm. (Transparent plastic used
as an appendage AGAIN? Yuck!)

    Although there's not
really much to Thrust, he's rather show-accurate nonetheless. He could
have been done a bit better, however. I personally use McDonald's Thrust
as a cycle drone, since he's so small.
