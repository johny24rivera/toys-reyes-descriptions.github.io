    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 warrior
Drift toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     "Alpine Strike" Drift
is actually less of a "themed" redeco and more of an homage to
     <a href="drift.html">
      "G1"
Drift
     </a>
     in his color scheme. By and large, the vast majority of Alpine
Strike Drift is white and black. Almost the entire car mode is white, with
some translucent black used for the windows and wheels. In robot mode,
his main body, middle of the arms, and hands are a solid black plastic.
Those are some okay main colors, but pretty basic. To make him more G1
Drift-y, many of the angular line paint apps from the
     <a href="rid2blizdrift.html">
      warrior
Blizzard Strike version
     </a>
     of Drift have been used and painted red here.
In vehicle mode is gives him a decent amount of red on the side doors,
the sides of the front hood, and on the faux headcrest on his front bumper,
but really some more red paint should have been used on the rear half,
which is basically entirely white and black and looks a little boring without
another color. (Using some Japanese characters would've looked good and
helped link him more to the original Drift.) In robot mode is where the
red really comes through-- not just on the sides of his car doors/arms,
but on his chest, painted around his head, and on his knees, feet, and
sword blades. I wish there was perhaps a BIT more on his waist, but otherwise
the color breakup here in this mode is pretty good. Drift also has a titch
of light sky blue, used for his eyes in robot mode and headlights in vehicle
mode. It's a nice touch and works as accent color, but G1 accurate or not,
he needed a bit more here. White/black/red is an okay scheme, but it's
a bit basic, and another color would've helped him look better.

     Alpine Strike Drift
is a decent buy if you want a nod in the RID2015 line to Drift's original
color scheme, but that's pretty much its sole purpose. The white, black,
and red color scheme-- while okay-- isn't anything to gawk at, and his
original color scheme and ESPECIALLY his Blizzard Strike color scheme look
better on this mold.
