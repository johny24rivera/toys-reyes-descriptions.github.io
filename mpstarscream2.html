not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Masterpiece Starscream.

     Well, this was inevitable--
honestly, given how difficult the original Masterpiece Starscream was to
get in the U.S., I'm surprised it took this long. Anyways, this version
of Masterpiece Starscream takes the same general mold, but with the same
changes made that first appear in the U.S. with
     <a href="mpthundercracker.html">
      Masterpiece
Thundercracker
     </a>
     . The mold is also colored in more traditionally "classic"
Starscream colors-- there's no battle damage on this one, it's just straightforward
Starscream's colors, with light milky gray being the main color, along
with a fair amount of red on the chest and metallic blue on the rear wings,
lower legs and arms, and nosecone. The light milky gray plastic is a bit
of a disappointment-- I wanted something a bit more metallic-looking on
a Masterpiece figure, in particular-- but the dark blue looks really nice
with its metallic shade, and contrasts against the gray and red quite well.
He's got a nice transparent orange cockpit too, along with some metallic
gunmetal gray paint around it and on a few other places like his chest
and face, which are painted quite well. As you'd expect, Starscream also
has the white/red lines on his main wings, and some "F"-shaped lines on
his rear wings, both of which look nice. That said, even if it's accurate,
there is a bit too much unbroken gray, particularly in jet mode. I rather
liked the "battle damage" on the original MP Starscream, to be honest.
Just like with the other MP Seekers, Starscream has the usual platform
and transparent stand with his name on it.

     Beyond the MP Thundercracker
mold changes, nothing specific has been changed mold-wise for MP Starscream
2.0. Unfortunately, this includes the lack of mold renewal, which means
that the issues I mentioned with
     <a href="mpacidstorm.html">
      MP Acid Storm
     </a>
     and
     <a href="mpsunstorm.html">
      Sunstorm
     </a>
     are even MORE egregious on Starscream.
This mold is almost falling apart at this point-- the rear side wings fall
off at a touch, the back wing pieces can come off easily during transformation,
and I've heard reports even of badly-molded sliders on the back that you
use for the wings during transformation. This is just... unconscionable,
especially for a Masterpiece toy that's had these issues two times already
even before its release.

     I WANT to wholeheartedly
recommend Masterpiece Starscream 2.0, given how accurate he is to his traditional
colors, the original one is really hard to find, and at only $60 this is
a big price drop from the other recent TRU-exclusive MP Seekers. However,
the myriad mold issues have all just come to a head here, and it just doesn't
quite make that "recommended" purchase because of it. It's a real shame.

       Unsurpassed in ego or ambition, Starscream
is the scheming second-in-command to Megatron. His all-consuming hunger
for absolute power overcomes what little reason there is in him, driving
him to adopt ever more vile plots in his quest to unseat Megatron as leader
of the Decepticons. With his trademark null-ray cannons and a vast array
of secondary weapons, Starscream is second only to Megatron and Optimus
Prime in power.
