    Optimus Prime's "mainline"
voyager release for the Prime line has a vehicle mode that's a little bit
less accurate to his show model than his
    <a href="prifeoptimus.html">
     First
Edition voyager version
    </a>
    -- in some good ways, and in some bad. For one,
the red and blue are a tad lighter in shade than on the First Edition versions,
along with a lighter brownish gray that becomes more visible in robot mode.
Generally, I think that these lighter colors don't look quite as good as
the darker shades on the slightly more accurate voyager First Edition version,
though by themselves the red and blue certainly don't look bad, and having
the gray being less obviously brown also makes it less obviously "dirty-looking",
if also less show-accurate. (The light milky gray plastic, unfortunately,
is still here, and still as boring as ever.) The black used primarily for
the wheels is also still here, and along with the bits of silver paint
and transparent light blue plastic on the windows (which is just a tad
TOO light for my taste), gives Optimus a fairly varied color palette in
vehicle mode. I wish a few more paint apps would have added to him-- such
as painted wheel hubs, for example, or a little something extra on all
that red in the front to break it up more-- but otherwise it looks great.
The yellow headlights also really pop against the red, though unfortunately
due to his transformation Optimus doesn't have a real back end for taillights
(and thus, of course, they aren't painted). Other than this minor issue,
though, Optimus Prime is largely robot kibble-free in this mode, with a
few telltale pieces behind the central section of the cab making it particularly
obvious that this is a robot in disguise. The overall proportions of the
mode look better than the voyager First Edition version, even if they're
less show-accurate-- the more angular, boxier look of the truck fits it
a bit better, and the windows and back end of the cab are better sized
proportionally this time around. For weapons, Optimus has both a vanilla
milky gray sword accessory that could stand to be longer and a "Powerizer"
gun, both of which can be stored on top of his back end in this mode. His
Powerizer weapon looks like a big clump of nothing when left alone, but
by pushing back on the gray lever it rotates out to form a transparent
blue rifle, with an ineffectual red light coming on in this mode. The light
isn't nearly bright enough to light up the blue plastic, though, and is
just generally a failed gimmick, made all the worse by the fact that its
recognizable mode-- the gun mode-- automatically snaps back into "incomprehensible
junk pile" mode when you let go of it. Sigh.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    This version of Optimus
has a noticeably simpler transformation than his complex voyager First
Edition version (though I still wouldn't call it easy)-- the result is
most definitely Optimus in robot mode but there's definitely a few more
caveats this time around. The most obvious and the biggest flaw with this
mode are the sections of his truck side hanging off his back-- unlike on
his voyager First Edition version, they stick out from behind Optimus'
midsection quite obviously, and the smokestacks don't "reorient" themselves
to be right behind Prime's head, which makes it more of an obvious backpack
and keeps Optimus from looking as streamlined here. I'm also not fond of
the slightly less-accurate shoulder panels that are made from the parts
of the truck above his windows, and the transparent plastic on his lower
arms, which is another failed attempt at using his ineffectual weapon gimmick
to "light up" his arms. The lower legs are also considerably more hollow
on this version, and the upper legs a bit skinner proportionally than they
should be. However, all of this is not to suggest that Optimus' robot mode
is bad; far from it. He still has core proportions that are very close
to his show model, and the mold detailing is exquisitely well-done where
it needs to be, such as on his abs and head. I wish a little more paint
had been used on his arms, but otherwise he's good there too, with silver,
blue, and yellow helping to break up all the gray in the center of this
form. His chest windows are also his ACTUAL truck chest windows this time
around, but in a twist are upside-down due to his unique transformation,
and look pretty good and not too "barrel-chested" for Optimus. (There's
also some nice "tech" detailing on the inside of the windows, which looks
fantastic.) For articulation, Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows (at two points), upwards/downwards slightly at the wrists, and at
the hips (at two points), knees, and ankles (at two points). No knee or
waist rotation is a bit of a bummer, but those small caveats aside you
can still get him into some pretty nice poses, especially considering how
well-balanced he generally is and how well-articulated his ankles are.

    Voyager-class Prime
"Robots in Disguise" Optimus Prime may not be quite as good as his stellar
First Edition voyager toy, but it's still a pretty good mold nonetheless,
with his weak weapons and his obvious backpack kibble in robot mode being
his only major downsides. His transformation isn't nearly as time-consuming
but still innovative, and his vehicle mode actually looks a bit better
overall than his voyager First Edition version, in my opinion (though it
is less show-accurate). If you want a "regular-sized" Prime Prime toy that
isn't difficult to remember how to transform, you can pick up this version
without any real reservations. If transformation complexity doesn't matter
to you, though, I'd recommend the First Edition voyager more.

      It took long years of patient training,
battlefield experience, and constant modifications for Optimus Prime to
achieve the raw might with which he combats Megatron and the Decepticons.
Now, he is a perfect warrior and a courageous leader, against whom evil
