    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars Ramulus. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars Ramulus

     Longhorn's name reminds
me more of a cow than a ram, but regardless, this is a pretty cool repaint.
It's certainly an original paint job-- I never would've thought bronze,
bluish black, blue, and gold-silver would have gone so well together, but
they do. I think the blue should've been a TAD darker, but it's a really
minor quibble. I also really like the goldish-silver plastic-- I've never
seen it used on a transformer before, and it has swirled of both gold AND
silver plastic in it, with both of the colors mixing together most of the
time, but some parts are more silver and others are more gold, and the
like. What I don't like about this plastic, though, is that's a little
bendy, and feels a bit cheap when compared to the other kinds of plastic
used on Longhorn. But what's really amazing about this toy, though, is
that it has a TON of paint apps. They're everywhere on this guy! Nearly
all of his fur detailing is colored bronze, he has maroon decoes on his
chest and his wrist-blades, and other odds and ends all over the place.
He's a beauty to look at, he really is. The "Energon radiation" pattern,
by the way, is, I'm guessing the purplish spray paint app on his horns.

     Longhorn is a fantastic
repaint of an already pretty-good mold-- he's got paint details out the
wazoo! Just be forewarned of the slightly bendy plastic that comprises
two-thirds of his body, though. If you don't have the original, by all
means pick Longhorn up. Heck, even if you DO have the original, Longhorn's
still worth serious consideration.
