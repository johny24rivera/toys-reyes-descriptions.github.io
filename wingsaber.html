    Wing Saber's vehicle
mode is... well, I don't have the slightest clue what it is, beyond a flying
craft of some sort. The front part has a sleek, triangular shape to it,
with a clearly visible transparent cockpit near the front, and I do like
the missile launchers at the sides of that front area, but the rest is
just... robot parts. The big structures at both ends of the vehicle are
obviously the robot legs, although the guns and the triangular silver paint
apps on them help intergrate them into the vehicle mode a tiny, TINY bit
more. He also has three deployable landing gear (with rolling wheels),
though the middle landing gear is so long when compared to the other two
that it's almost laughable. I mean, really, when you look at Wing Saber
in this mode from any angle but above, you have this little slim cockpit
area jutting out the front, while the rest of Wing Saber's vehicle mode
is ridiculously thick for what is supposed to be some kind of spacecraft.
I can't imagine this thing ever flying. I'm also not sure what exactly
the crests on top of this mode (which become his arms in robot mode) are
supposed to be, exactly-- just a big robot extra, I suppose. They don't
really contribute anything meaningful to the mode at all. The mold detailing,
however, is generally pretty good, with some nice stylistic detailing especially
in the arms. The paint detailing is also more than adequate. The color
scheme itself isn't exactly the most original in the world-- red, white,
silver, and blue are pretty typical Autobot colors-- but there's a reason
it's used so often, and that's because it works very well with an Autobot.
So no complaints there. Wing Saber is also HUGE for a Mega-- he's actually
bigger than some of the Ultras. In his vehicle mode, from end to end he's
about as long as
    <a href="omegasupreme.html">
     Omega Supreme
    </a>
    is tall.
So that's certainly a plus, that you're getting more plastic for your money.
But I can't bring myself to say too many positive things about this mode,
because it just looks like a bunch of robot parts thinly disguised as an
aircraft, really.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    In robot mode, however,
Wing Saber looks simply awesome. He's very Japanese in his style-- which
isn't surprising, seeing as how Wing Saber was more heavily developed by
Takara than any of the other Energon toys-- and he's got lots of ornate
little details on him, keeping this mode from being anything but boring.
The robot head also looks tough and a little menacing, with a bit of a
narrow-eyed glare and an angular faceplate. The proportions themselves
are pretty good when compared to the other Energon Autobots, though there
the feet are on the large side, and the waist is pretty skinny when compared
to the hips. I also wish the missile launchers could face forward in this
mode without it looking like Wing Saber has some HUUUGE protrusions coming
out of his kneecaps, but that's a small beef. There is one MAJOR problem
with this mode, however-- Wing Saber has got to be the most brickish new
Transformer mold created in about a decade. He can move side-to-side and
back-and-forth at the elbows and side-to-side at the hips. He can also
rotate his fists and legs at the knees, but that isn't really useful. That's
it when it comes to articulation, making this awesome-looking Transformer
a bit of a bore to play with in this mode, and that's a shame. Makes a
great display piece, though. Wing Saber's Autobot spark crystal is on his
lower right arm, and his black Powerlinx symbol is on the upper left side
of his back in this mode.

     Okay, so let's review;
Wing Saber, so far, has a brickish robot mode and a very questionable vehicle
mode. So then why does he have the pretty decent rating of 8.0? It's because
he also combines with
     <a href="enprime.html">
      Energon Optimus Prime
     </a>
     in two different ways, and both are awesome-- it's easily the toy's main
selling point. And even though Wing Saber splits into four different parts,
he still fits together very solidly in his normal mods. There are two configurations
for when he combines with Prime; Flight Mode and Fight Mode.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     In Flight Mode, Wing
Saber's feet become Prime's feet, and Wing Saber's upper body becomes Prime's
arms. This is my favorite of the two different combinations, as I really
like how Wing Saber's shoulders become winged jets hanging off of Optimus'
arms. The colors really mesh well, and Prime still has pretty good articulation
while he's combined-- he can move at the hips, knees, head, shoulders (at
two points), and at the elbows. My only real complaint-- and this goes
with the Fight Mode as well-- is that Prime's joints don't seem quite up
to the task of supporting Wing Saber's weight in addition to Prime's, so
he tends to be a little on the floppy side. Though, admittedly, I have
one of the earliest Prime toys (he still has a mouth instead of a faceplate),
so perhaps this was fixed on later versions. Other than that, no complaints
at all-- this mode is one of the best combinations in Energon, if not THE
best.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Fight Mode configuration
is a little less cool-looking, but it's still a very solid combination,
and works well with Prime. In this mode, the parts are switched-- Wing
Saber's legs become the arms, while Wing Saber's upper body becomes with
legs. The feet are a little bit long and look almost like large slippers,
so they look a little on the odd side-- that's my main stylistic complaint
with the mode, but that's about it. The arms look fantastic, as they're
big and bulky for some down 'n dirty fighting, and he has big missile launchers
on his wrists, to boot. The shoulders are also heavily stylized, with great
mold and paint detailing. Prime has the same articulation here as he does
in Flight Mode, with the addition of being able to move his four fingers
on each hand (all four fingers are one piece of plastic, though).
    </font>
    <p>
     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Wing Saber's individual
modes aren't particularly hot-- again, he has a pretty poor vehicle mode
and a statue of a robot mode-- but his combinations with Optimus Prime
are outstanding. However, because of this, I'd only recommend Wing Saber
IF you have Energon Prime or are planning to get him soon. Otherwise, skip
out on Wing Saber. And if you do get him, remember that he's a bunch of
extra limbs for Optimus Prime who also happen to form their own Transformer;
not visa versa.

        Wing Saber served as a first class transport
for members of Cybertron's high council before he discovered his true calling
as a warrior. His incredible speed and ariel skills have made him a valued
member of the Autobot team. In jet mode, his stealth abilities allow for
long range attack that have given the Autobots the upper hand during many
offensive maneuvers. Wing Saber takes great pride in his standing with
the Autobots and has proven his loyalty and devotion to Optimus Prime on
many occasions. His ability to powerlinx with Optimus gives their combined
robot form impressive flight capabilities. Megatron has kept an admiring
eye on Wing Saber and hopes to someday sway this great Autobot warrior
to the side of the Decepticons.
