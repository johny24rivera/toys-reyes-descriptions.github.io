    Beast mode is an eagle
with a wolf head and wolf back feet. This character looks like a mythical
character, not like a fuzor. This mode is very nicely done; the only negative
thing I have to say about it is the fact that the robot arms can be seen
somewhat easily inside the flaps on the beast mode back legs. The detailing
and articulation in this mode is superb. The leg proportions are a little
off, though, as the front legs are nearly twice as large as the back legs.

    His robot mode has some
extras, though. His eagle tail feathers and wings sort of stick out, and
so does his wolf back legs off his arms. His wings are supposed to show,
though. His basic body of this mode looks surprisingly normal for a fuzor.
The only major problem with this mode, other than the extras, is his little
connectors that hold his waist together can come apart easily. His last
feather on his wings can be fired like a missle if you pull his tailfeathers.
These can be fired from his beast mode, too. These also can double as swords,
but they look too stumpy for that.

    A very nice transformer;
one of the best fuzors.

      Shadows of mystery cloak this silent
and proud warrior. Part wolf, part eagle, Silverbolt possesses all the
attributes of a great lone warrior: speed, power, wisdom, intelligence.
His uncanny ability to track and then furiously overcome Predacons by himself,
only to suddenly disappear into the backdrop, has inspired myths describing
a fierce winged warrior who has come to defeat their evil ranks one by
one. Preferring to work alone, Silverbolt is a ferociously intelligent
fighter: extremely dexterous, he seems to be everywhere at once, striking
with fearsome talons and firing hidden point-missiles from his wing tips
to ultimately surface victorious.
