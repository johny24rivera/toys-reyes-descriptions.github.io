    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Voyager Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated Voyager Starscream

     As is expected with a
Starscream repaint from any line, Skywarp here is an homage to the G1 Seeker
of the
     <a href="g1skywarp.html">
      same name
     </a>
     . However, like the other
Animated Starscream "clones", Skywarp's color scheme differs in some subtle
ways when compared to his G1 self. Yes, his primary color scheme is still
black and purple, but the silver has been all but taken out of the equation,
with only a few bits of gunmetal gray on his chest and some silver on his
waist. Instead, three different shades of purple have been used, and the
all work marvelously well against the black. The light metallic purple
is used mostly on the front of the jet/chest area, while a moderate royal
purple is used for most of the robot mode connector pieces, and a dark
metallic purple is used for some jet mode accents. They're all different
enough from each other to justify being there, and really help add to Skywarp's
overall color variety even though they're technically the same color. As
is traditional, Skywarp also has an orange cockpit, and this orange cockpit
translates to orange robot mode eyes and missiles as well, which is an
excellent accent color and goes well against both black and purple. However,
I'm not fond of the replacement of Skywarp's traditional "pure" black with
a more impure, charcoal black. It doesn't look BAD per se, but a pure black
would've looked a lot better and made the contrast stand out even more.

     No mold changes have
been made to Animated Skywarp-- which is a shame, as he really could've
used a remolded expression. Starscream's smirk doesn't work well for this
fraidy-cat character. There is also quite a few reports (and this includes
my own) of Skywarp having exceptionally poor quality control. Not when
it comes to his paint apps, mind you, but his joints-- many of them are
EXTREMELY loose, particularly his ankle ball joints which pop off pretty
much if you just touch them. Luckily this isn't a universal thing, but
it is something to watch out for.

     Animated Skywarp is
a great redeco of the Starscream mold, though I would've much preferred
a purer black to help bring out the contrast more. That aside, I'd still
recommend it easily over the original Animated Voyager Starscream-- just
be on the lookout for quality control issues.

       Skywarp wouldn't call himself a coward.
He'd call himself smart. So what if he runs away from combat? Fighting
is dangerous! All those missiles and lasers could really hurt someone!
As a clone of Starscream, he's got all the power and skill of the leader
of the Decepticon air forces, but none of the courage or ambition. He could
easily be one of the most dangerous Decepticons of all time, but since
he screams and runs away the second a shot is fired, he's mostly just a
joke.
