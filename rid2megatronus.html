    Megatronus' vehicle mode
is a Cybertronian tank, though in this case "Cybertronian" is just kinda
short hand for "a little lazy". Thankfully it's not just the robot mode
doing extreme yoga, but there's still definitely some really weak spots
about this tank mode. The treads look largely good, with molded-in wheels
and even a missile rack on the top of each tread. The turret is also fairly
good, with a nice angular look that narrows into a cannon mouth that's
still fairly wide. The back of the robot head is pretty darned obvious
on the back end of the turret section, though at least it's not the full
head and there's a couple of spikes back there to help it blend in... slightly.
A bit of the robot chest panel also sticks out from the sides below the
cannon, but this is pretty minor. The rest of what should be a solid tank
body is just... gone. This tank's all treads and turret. There's just a
narrow body connecting the two, which is obviously the robot waist and
hips. On the front section of the lower body there's little drill details
molded in to kind of logically allow him to "drill away" any obstacles
that would theoretically come in between his two tread sections, but it's
still hard to see how this could be a functional alt mode-- there's just
not enough body to make it look like it would withstand much. As with most
RID2015 toys the detailing is farily sparse, though the treads are fairly
well-detailed and there's the RID-usual trio of "divots" on places like
the top of the turret. There's also cool little details painted light blue
on the underside of the turret (which is where you also slide in Megatronus'
spear, which is his robot mode weapon-- here it's more of a "turret bayonet").
The general color scheme is pretty dull, just a fairly light milky gray
(which is super boring) and charcoal black. The black is semi-metallic,
which makes it look a bit better, but making it a more "pure" black would've
looked better. Additionally, to make the toy show-accurate there should
have been less gray and more black. As far as paint, there's some nice
metallic royal purple on the front end of the turret, as well as on the
front end of the "bayonet", and a bit of silver on the sides of the tank
treads that becomes part of the feet in robot mode. Beyond that and the
aforementioned little blue details, he's pretty sparse paint-wise in this
mode, which is especially a shame around the treads-- all those wheels
really should've been painted silver to stand out a bit more.

    Megatronus' transformation
is fairly obvious from the tank mode-- the treads become the legs (with
a few ingenious panel flips), and the turret becomes the main body and
arms. This is definitely the mode this toy was designed around, and is
pretty solid. The aforementioned tank drill bits kinda stick out from the
sides of his butt, but otherwise there's no kibble in this mode to speak
of. The lower legs are just a TITCH too large-- they do form the entire
treads, after all-- but otherwise Megatronus is quite proportional, with
a fairly wide chest that narrows down to a decently-sized waist and upper
legs, nice shoulders formed from halves of part of the turret, and nice
lower arms that are formed from the tank cannon, complete with that nifty
blue and royal purple paint detailing there. Because of the transformation
the lower arms are a little 2-D, though, and look too flat from a side
view. The headsculpt is very well-done, with two large side horns and two
smaller horns on the forehead, with an otherwise "normal" but stern-looking
face. The red eyes and silver paint on the face really brings out those
details and definitely makes him look like a bad guy. There's also some
nifty angular and circular chest details molded on, but unfortunately they
aren't painted. The color scheme is broken up a little more in this mode,
with dark purple paint on the middle of the chest, the sides of the shoulders,
and the knees, with the other paint apps from tank mode carrying over.
That said, the color scheme is still fairly dull with so much charcoal
black and light gray. Megatronus' articulation is VERY good, with joints
at the neck, shoulders (at three points; four if you count the shoulder
armor moving up-and-down), elbows, waist rotation, and at the hips (at
two points) and knees. Given how well-balanced he is, he can get into some
pretty darned cool poses.

    Warrior Megatronus is
definitely the best toy of this design, but that's fairly faint praise.
The robot mode has very nice proportions, articulation, and an overall
look, but the tank mode is quite poor, and the color scheme is pretty dull
as well. So recommended if you like the character, but if you're not a
completist you can probably skip this one-- there's plenty of better RID2015
warriors out there.

     *This version of Megatronus was also released in Toys "R" Us-exclusive
"Clash of the Transformers" packaging; the only difference between that
version and the mass-release version of the toy, however, is the headsculpt.
On the Toys "R" Us exclusive version, Megatronus has a "helmet down" headsculpt
as seenÂ  in the cartoon. I love the wicked-looking horned, emotionless
headsculpt on the Toys "R" Us version better, but it's also MUCH more difficult
to get and was quite rare, so keep that in mind if you want that version
more.
