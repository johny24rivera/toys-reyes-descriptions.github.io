    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the TF Movie Legends class
Brawl toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the TF Movie
Legends class Braw toy

     Well, here's something
that doesn't happen often-- a Beast Machines homage! Yessir, Tankor here
is a repaint homage to the
     <a href="tankdrone.html">
      BM character
     </a>
     of
the same name. It's not exact due to the small scale, but there's some
definite similarities. The main color is light blue here, whereas BM Tankor's
colors were white and dark blue, so barring that this is a nice compromise.
The main giveaway (beyond the name) that' this is an homage to the BW character
are the robot mode details, however. The yellow "caution"-esque lines on
the legs, similar lines on the left side of his chest, the red X on the
right side of his chest, the silver paint apps on his face and chest, the
color of his treads-- all are copied pretty closely from BM Tankor. (Tankor
actually had missile pods in the shape of an "X" on that side of his chest,
but at this scale it's close enough, really.) My favorite paint job nod,
though, is that a red line is painted not only on the eyes, but on the
"nose ridge" between them as well. At first this might seem like an odd
oversight, but it the nose ridge poking out through the eyes, when looked
at from a head-on angle, actually looks like Tankor's single "roaming eye"
due to the lighting! One of the most ingenious paint apps I've ever seen
on an homage toy when the original mold clearly had no intention of being
this character. Unfortunately, all this attention to this robot mode does
have a downside-- Tankor's pretty sparsely painted in tank mode, with no
paint apps at all on his turret.

     No mold changes have
been made to RotF Tankor.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     RotF Tankor is a fantastic
repaint homage with some nicely done paint apps in robot mode, but his
vehicle mode suffers from very few paint apps and it desperately needs
some. Recommended if you like Beast Machines (or Tankor), otherwise it's
roughly even with Legends class Brawl in terms of the colors, in my opinion.
Oh, what they could have done with this homage on the deluxe scale...
