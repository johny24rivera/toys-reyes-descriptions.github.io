    Beast mode is a technorganic
bat. (IMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, the pic of the beast mode above is
slightly mistransformed. Nightscream's upper body rotates around so that
the wings are in front and the legs are in back, creating a more balanced
look.) This mode might look alright if it wasn't for the fact that the
bat head is rather big proportionally, and, to put it bluntly, it looks
rather doofy. Almost comical, actually. Definitely not the menacing or
heroic look you'd look for in a Transformer. Otherwise, this mode is done
well for a Happy Meal toy. The feet look good proportionally, and this
Nightscream can actually stand on them and not look odd, unlike the Ultra-priced
"official"

    toy. I'm not crazy
about the translucent blue plastic being used for Nightscream's entire
upper bat wings and their appendages, however. It would have been better
to paint the "appendage" part of the wings, to make it look more realistic.

    Nightscream's transformation
is, like most other Happy Meal toys, extremely simple. Basically, you just
twist around his back panel, push down the bat head a bit to make it less
obvious in robot mode, and then straighten out his robot legs and arms.

    Nightscream's mode is,
sadly, more accurate in this mode than his Ultra-priced counterpart! The
wings are attached to the legs, unlike the other version. Nightscream's
hunch is still gone on this toy, but I'll let you decide if that's a good
or a bad thing. The thing that really bugs me about this mode, though,
is that Nightscream's hands are molded into a "begging" position, making
him look like he's about to roll over for a doggie treat. :PÂ  Nightscream's
mini Maximal symbol can be found on a blue circle on his right shoulder
in this mode.

    Nightscream's few problems
could have been fixed easily, and I guess that's why they bug me so much.
Still, Nightscream isn't that bad of a Happy Meal toy, and if you're either
a completist or if you like the little Happy Meal toys, you might wanna
pick one up.
