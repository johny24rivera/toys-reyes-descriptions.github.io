    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 legion Sideswipe

     "Alpine Strike" Sideswipe
is basically RID2015
     <a href="genredalert.html">
      Red Alert
     </a>
     , as he's
in Red Alert's colors (though certainly not in a "police-y" way like Red
Alert, because that would require remolding of the alt mode). In vehicle
mode particularly this scheme looks pretty good, as the white and red--
though a fairly basic Autobot color scheme-- works well together, what
with the long red stripe along each side of the toy and red pieces on the
top that become Sideswipe's feet in robot mode. (Actually, I can't believe
it never occurred to me before, but the red feet pieces on top DO kind
of look like slightly oversized sirens. If that was intentional, nice job
there, Hasbro.) The shade of dull aquamarine on the windows and headlights
also is quite good and goes REALLY nicely against both of the other main
colors, to the point where I wish it was used more often, Red Alert-accuracy
be darned. In robot mode the black becomes a bit more apparent beyond just
the wheels, being used on the upper legs as well. There's also a few red
paint apps on the waist, middle of the chest, and around the entire head
except for the eyes, which are little blue dots. It all looks pretty good,
though I wish a bit of blue was used for the faux headlights on the chest
and perhaps a bit of red on the arms. Those are small quibbles, though.

     Alpine Strike Sideswipe--
regardless of whether you want to make him RID "Red Alert" or not-- is
a pretty nice color scheme on the toy, with the red paint used on the vehicle
mode and robot mode chest really helping to make the color scheme work
and be more visually interesting than Sideswipe's normal red-and-black
scheme. Recommended over the original Legion figure.
