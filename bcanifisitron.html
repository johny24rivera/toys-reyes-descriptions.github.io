    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Cybertron Mode
Ratchet. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated Cybertron

     "Fisitron's" name is
a copyright work-around for his real name, Ironfist (whose name now legally
belongs to a certain Marvel superhero), as Fisitron is an anagram of Ironfist.
(It was also the "pen name" of Ironfist in the IDW comic-verse, which is
mostly what's responsible for his recent surge in popularity.) Staying
true to Animated, Fisitron's scheme is rather colorful and eye-catching,
being mostly a pale dull bluish-green and pumpkin orange, with some black
to serve as a neutral color. The two main colors contast against each other
well enough, but I feel that they're both just a tad too "bold"-- if you
look up pictures of the original Ironfist, you'll see that the orange on
him is more of a tan color and the green is more of a blue, which I feel
would've looked a bit better on this toy. There IS a smidge of tan on this
toy, though it's just used for a couple of mostly interior "connector"
pieces, and this really doesn't add to (or detract) from the overall color
scheme. I do really like the metallic fuchsia paint and transparent red
plastic used for his window/chest, though-- they make for wonderful accents.

     Fisitron has the same
head mold as the
     <a href="bcautotrooper.html">
      Autotroopers
     </a>
     , but it's
been painted sufficiently differently enough where it works very effectively
for his character-- painting the Autotroopers' visor to look like two seperate
eyes certainly helps a lot, and the goggles on his forehead certainly work
well for the guy. No complaints here. Of note is that in addition to being
a Botcon 2011 exclusive, Fisitron was only available ("free") if you bought
the expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked the set up in person
at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt worth quite a lot of money.

     Fisitron is an excellent
re-use of a mold and head originally intended for the Autotroopers that
both makes sense and capitalizes a bit on the character's recent surge
in popularity. That said, I think that although his color scheme is overall
decent, the main two colors are a tad TOO saturated, and at least one of
'em should've been toned down a bit. If you're a big fan of the character
or Animated enough where you're willing to pay aftermarket prices, I'd
mildly recommend him-- otherwise, you can probably pass.

       Fisitron is an overly enthusiastic maker
of tools, and the genius behind some of the most effective weapons in the
Autobots' arsenal. In his cozy lab he makes whatever comes to mind. For
each strange gizmo he dreams up, he also manages to develop devices that
can turn an Autobot into a one-bot wrecking crew. He always keeps a pair
of nucleon shock gauntlets handy. Although Fisitron created Optimus Prime's
laser axe, it is often credited to his rival Skyfall.
