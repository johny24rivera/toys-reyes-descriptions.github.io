    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is, as I'm sure you're familar with now, a Chevrolet Camaro-- only now
it's of the most recent iteration of the vehicle as opposed to the '70s
version that the
    <a href="movlegbumblebee.html">
     Legends class toy
    </a>
    from
the first movie toyline sported. He's pretty much how you'd expect Bumblebee
to look at this scale-- no surprises here. The golden yellow looks a lot
more appetizing than the plain or "cheese" yellow seen on some other versions
of Movie Bumblbeee, and the dark blue used for the windows and the black
contrast well with the yellow. Again, I'm not a particular fan of yellow,
but good colors were chosen to go with it. All of the necessary mold and
paint details are there-- with the exception of the tail-lights, which
are unpainted. Given how many other details ARE painted at this scale,
though, it's fairly easy to let that one slide. There are no robot extras
in this mode, except for the robot feet which are a tad obvious if you
look at him from the rear view.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Even though Bumblebee
transforms mostly the same as his original Movie Legends version, the arms
transform differently, and this small difference makes Bumblebee quite
a bit better of a figure. Besides ball-joint articulation at the hips,
he also has ball-joint movement at two points at his shoulders-- hardly
a master of posability, but it's adequate for a Legends figure and his
arms are no longer incredibly awkward sticks attached to his body firmly.
Granted, the arms are still just molded on the inside of the sides of the
car in this mode, but that's almost unavoidable at this scale. His other
proportions-- legs, chest, face-- are fairly good, though his chest is
a tad large and his head a tad small. The sculpt on the face is fairly
good, though the paint apps seem a tad sloppy around there. I also would've
appreciated paint apps on his arms or feet to emphasize the "robot detailing"
on those parts, as opposed to the oddly-places and superfluous Autobot
symbol on his right knee (given that he's already got an Autobot symbol
on his head)

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    RotF Legends Bumblebee,
even though largely sticking to the same design as his predecessor except
for the arms, is a marked improvement for the size class over the original
Legends toy of the character. His arms in particular are much better, though
his color scheme is a bit more subdued and palatable as well. It still
could use some improvement in some areas like articulation, but I'd say
he's mildly recommended if you like Legends and Bumblebee.

        In his vehicle mode,
Bumblebee is, you guessed it, a yellow Camaro. This time around he is the
2010 camaro as opposed to the 70's camaro. In most respects, he looks better,
no unsightly transformation hinges or anything. Color-wise he's nice, no
complaints there, I'm about the same mind here as Beasty.

        Robot mode is about
average in terms of legends go, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. He
has some similarities to his first version, such as the door wings going
straight back. He has much better arms though, and his chest isn't as obnoxious.
Articulation is about average for a legend (which means no head or knee
articulation...bleh).
       </font>
       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Overall Bumblebee isn't
bad, but I still find his lack of articulation to be angering, seeing as
how a legend costs a little below a scout, but he's still a good figure.
If you're a Bumblebee or legends fan, get him, but otherwise I would stick
to a deluxe one.
