    The Activator version
of Bulkhead's vehicle mode is more deformed than even many of the Animated
Bumper Battlers. It's REALLY squashed up, with the front part looking fairly
normal, but the length of the vehicle mode squished up to roughly half
of what its length ought to be. Needless to say, it looks really odd. There's
also no real back end to the vehicle mode, so Bulkhead's hands and feet
stick out REALLY obviously from any view that's close to a backend view.
On the plus side, I do like how two of his hinges are disguised as side-mounted
machine guns, that's pretty creative. The mold detailing is about what
you'd expect from the scale, and the paint detailing is average, though
many of the paint apps are metallic-colored, which is a bit of a bonus
for me.

    Pressing down on the
red siren transforms Bulkhead mostly into his robot mode, with a bit of
folding out of the limbs the only real manual part of the transformation.
There's.... really not many positive things I can say about his robot mode.
His articulation is decent, I suppose; he can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows, and hips. That's really about it. He's got some really obvious,
huge pieces of back kibble that pretty much comprise three-fourths of his
vehicle mode, his back panel flaps all over the place and doesn't lock
in, his arms and head are too small, his head is actually on a piece of
plastic BELOW his chest, which looks odd from a straight-on view, his arms
aren't connected at all to his chest, which gives him a partially hollow
look from many angles... really, on almost any part of this problem you're
going to find a problem.

    Activator Bulkhead is,
quite simply, a mess. His vehicle mode has some obvious robot parts sticking
out from it and is horribly deformed, and his robot mode is the same. Not
recommended except for hardcore completists and Bulkhead fans.

      Bulkhead is the biggest and strongest
of the Autobots. Unfortunately for the other Autobots, nearby buildings,
vehicles and machinery, he's also the clumsiest. He means well, and most
of the time his wrecking balls smash the right thing. He's just as strong-willed
as he is powerful too, and he never gives up when presented with a challenge.
