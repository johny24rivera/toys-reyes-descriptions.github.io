    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars Buzzclaw. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars Buzzclaw

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Buzzclaw is repainted
to look similar to a G1 Insecticon, with purple, black, and yellow being
used, as well as red to add a bit more variety to the mix. It's definitely
an intentional homage, seeing as he and
     <a href="bcdirge.html">
      Dirge
     </a>
     are meant to be two of the last surving members of the G1 Insecticon group
in the 2005 convention's comic. Regardless, Buzzclaw's new color scheme
is EXCELLENT-- the transparent purple is an absolutely wonderful color,
especially with the dull yellow used on top of it to contrast-- in fact,
the way the yellow is painted on the face almost makes it look like a skull!
The black parts help to add more "darkness" and evil to the way Buzzclaw
looks, and the red used for the wings, tail-shield, and bug eyes is just
the right color to top it all off. The black-and-red detailing used on
the wings is especially astounding, and one of the most eye-catching parts
of the figure. Buzzclaw has a small Decepticon insignia on the underside
of his tail-shield to help identify his allegiance-- no old Predacon rub
symbol on this repaint.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Buzzclaw from his predecessor; however, like on the other
Botcon Buzzclaw repaints, the mandibles have been assembled the wrong way;
to fix this, you need to unscrew the bolt connecting the insect head to
the neck, crack open the halves (don't put too much force into it), switch
the mandibles around so they're facing the other direction, and then reassemble
the thing again. It's rather difficult, though, and you can break some
of the pegs holding together the two head halves if you're not careful,
so I only recommend doing this is you're experienced with taking apart
and reassembling toys.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon Buzzclaw is an
astoundingly good repaint, with all the right colors in all the right places.
No complaints about the scheme at all-- this is as good as the mold's going
to get. My personal favorite color-wise of the Botcon 2005 Exclusives.

       Buzzclaw is one of the few remaining
members of the ancient Insecticon clan, a group of powerful Transformer
warriors dating back to the beginnings of the Great Wars. He is brash,
loud and obnoxious. However, he is also dedicated to helping Deathsaurus
bring the Decepticon Empire back as a major power in the galaxy. He sees
this as an opportunity to practice his own brand of brutality on the population
of planets everywhere. His past as a warrior in the gladiatorial pits of
Polyhex have afforded him skill and preference for hand-to-hand combat.
He relishes the feeling of an enemy's body going limp at death in his hands
or claws.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Abilities: Buzzclaw is trained in various
forms of hand-to-hand combat and has spent eons using those skills in battle.
His insectoid beast form allows him to use his skills in both modes, each
allowing him to utilize different weapons. As a beast, he can use his claws
and mandibles to tear enemies apart. In robot mode he uses his wrist mounted
claws and shield in combat. Like all Insecticons, he has an innate ability
to create clones out of himself from existing raw materials in his immediate
vicinity, however the ability has become diluted over time as he has changed
his exo-structures. It is this ability that Deathsaurus hopes to unlock
from his genetic code.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Weakness: Buzzclaw's over-reliance on
hand-to-hand combat makes him vulnerable in situations requiring more artilery-based
solutions.
