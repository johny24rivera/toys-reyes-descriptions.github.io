    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Sideways. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Sideways
    <a href="cysideways.html">

     Given that the Sweeps
are meant to essentially be "extensions" of Scourge's will, it makes sense
that not only do they use the same mold, but they're colored similarly.
All of the silver paint apps on the Sweeps here are the same shade of color
and in the same exact same places as the silver on
     <a href="bcscourge.html">
      Botcon
2009 Scourge
     </a>
     , and the white plastic is the same on the Sweeps as on
Scourge as well. There are only two differences between the Sweeps and
Scourge, though they are major-- the darker blue on Scourge has been replaced
with a paler, more teal blue on the Sweeps, and the red &amp; transparent
red on Scourge is a yellow &amp; transparent yellow on the Sweeps. This
gives the effect of making the Sweeps look like less-powerful, less-evil
versions of Scourge-- which they are, so it works. That said, I think the
yellow and pale blue don't quite as well together as Scourge's red and
darker blue. The Sweeps also come three-to-a-pack, and though there are
three different bio cards for them, they're all identical, which I think
isn't a particularly cool decision for something like Botcon exclusives,
I would've preferred if they had just allowed you to purchase one, but
make more of them then the other exclusives so people could "troop-build"
if they wanted to. (Still, at least for Botcon exclusives they're cheap--
they're only about twice retail price if you divide the price of the set
into thirds, which is honestly rather impressive.)
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Botcon Sweeps have
the same tiny head mold as Scourge, so my comments on his head are reflected
on the Sweeps' heads as well.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The Sweeps are a nice
idea, and their color scheme comes off quite nicely (though not quite as
nicely as Scourge's). I wish that they differed a little more from Scourge
in terms of their paint apps, though, just to help differentiate them more.
I also think it would've been a better idea if there were some slight differences
between the individual 3 Sweeps since you can only buy them in sets of
three, just so you know which is which (either that, or sell them individually).
I don't think the Sweeps are overall quite as good as Scourge, but you're
probably going to find them for cheaper on eBay, and it's still an excellent
mold with good colors, so if you're in the market for Botcon exclusives,
you might wanna check out these.

       Created from Decepticon wreckage, Sweep
Two is the hand-to-hand combat specialist of the Sweep legion. While his
fellow Sweeps generally prefer using energy and ballistic weaponry, he
prefers to use his knowledge of Cybertronian martial arts to enforce Scourge's
will. He is extremely disciplined and believes that following orders is
paramount to everything else. He represents the most brutal aspects of
Scourge's personality and fulfills his role with no remorse. Scourge often
relies on him to keep the other Sweeps in line, and his mere presence is
often sufficient to reach this goal. Sweep Two is an expert in the use
of his dual electron blades. He is often seen using them to dispatch his
enemies instead of utilizing his array of energy weapons. This is both
a strength and a weakness as he will sometimes opt for close combat when
ranged combat would be the more tactically sound option.

        Forged from the remains of fallen Decepticon
warriors, Sweep Six is the most skilled tactician among the Sweeps. He
is always quiet, calm and self-spoken. This disposition should not be taken
as a sign of weakness, however. Underneath his muted exterior is a strong,
calcuating mind. He sees the Autobot/Decepticon conflict as a carefully
planned series of tactical decisions. Scourge often consults him on planning
missions for the Sweeps, and it is a role he executes with grim determination.
Utilizing finely tuned sensors and communications equipment, he often creates
three-dimensional battlefield images and transmits them to other warriors
as he flies over the combat zone. Sweep Six lacks patience for those who
he deems his intellectual inferiors and has been known to lash out against
them. This sometimes causes friction with other Decepticons.

         Like all the other warriors in the Sweeps
army, Sweep Seven was created using parts from the bodies of deactivated
Decepticons. Decepticons often have trouble maintaining conversations with
Sweep Seven due to his tendency to walk off, deciding his time is better
spent developing some new weapons system for the Sweeps. Scourge relies
on him to keep the weaponry used by the Sweeps the most current and lethal
available. He sees weapons development as an intellectual challenge and
grows quickly bored once a new weapon has been developed. Scourge often
feels Sweep Seven is an extension of both his own intellect and creativity
and uses him accordingly for the benefit of the Decepticon Empire. When
called into battle, Sweep Seven is often eager to test his new weapons,
but they sometimes backfire on him.
