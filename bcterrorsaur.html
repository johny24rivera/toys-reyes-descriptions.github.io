    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Air Raid.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Combiner Wars Air Raid

     Given that he was one
of the characters obviously missing from the 2006 pre-BW set, Terrorsaur
getting a BotCon toy this time around was pretty much inevitable. The Air
Raid mold works remarkably well for him, all things considered, with a
fitting alt mode and a robot mode with proportions generally accurate to
his show model (but definitely with boxier lower legs). Plus the pterodactyl
jet "parts" go on the upper back, just like on
     <a href="terrorsaur.html">
      the
original toy
     </a>
     . As for Terrorsaur's color scheme, it's mostly a fairly
pale red-- it's an okay shade, but a darker/"richer" shade of red would've
looked better, methinks. In vehicle mode he's got a lot of dull red blotches
on his wings to simulate his coloration on the BW TV show, though again,
I wish they were a little darker for better contrast. The nosecone has
the best paint apps, with a light pumpkin orange tip and a "mouth" painted
on the sides with teeth on the underside. You can practically hear Terrorsaur's
screeching voice coming out of that. There's also black and metallic gunmetal
gray lining on much of the vehicel mode-- the cockpit, the sides of the
vents to the front and sides of the wings, and the sides of the tailfins.
The light orange at the end of his wings also helps bust up the color scheme
a bit more as well, and complements the red nicely. In robot mode Terrorsaur
is definitely a bit more plain-looking, with more unpainted pale red visible.
He's got some blah light milky gray plastic, but thankfully it's limited
to his upper legs and a few minor parts-- most of his "gray" is silver
paint. This is visible on his shoulders, face, waist, toes, and triangles
on his lower legs that are meant (somewhat unsuccessfully) to mimic the
angles on his knees on the original toy. There's also a bit more gunmetal
gray in this mode on his fists, stomach, and lower legs, but I wish his
chest and underside of his wings had a bit more paint, given that this
is a BotCon toy.

     Terrorsaur has a new
headsculpt, and it's fairly accurate and proportional, with the little
black "jewel" in his forehead, a silver face, and light orange eyes (they
technically should be red, but he's already got enough red). My only issue
here is that his mouth looks... off, slightly. I get that it's supposed
to be a smirky smile, but it looks a little weird-- maybe the lips are
a little too large? Other than that the headsculpt's fine-- though there's
no "open" area around the balljoint in the back, so he can't look up much.
Additionally, no, I didn't forget it in the pics above-- Terrorsaur bizarrely
does not come with a hand/foot/gun accessory, so you'll have to borrow
someone else's if you want to combine him. Otherwise, no mold changes were
made to Terrorsaur compared to CW Air Raid.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     BotCon Terrorsaur fills
a very obvious gap in a pre-Beast Wars collection, but unfortunately in
addition to being a BotCon exclusive, he was only available with each Primus
package a preregistrant picked up in-person at the 'Con-- thus he goes
for quite a lot on the aftermarket. They should've made this guy a regular
attendee exclusive as opposed to, say,
     <a href="bctigatron16.html">
      Tigatron
     </a>
     .
Terrorsaur's an okay mold with an okay color scheme, and the nosecone in
particular is well-done, but my want of this toy has less to do with the
quality of the paint job and mold and more with the character, and I'd
imagine that's the case with the vast majority who want this guy.

       Terrorsaur flies through the skies a
silent warrior. Using a bright crimson fuselage as his camouflage, Terrorsaur
likes to attack with the sun at his back as he descends upon Autobot and
Maximal alike with reckless abandon. One of Megatron's most skilled fliers,
Terrorsaur has secret ambitions to rule the Predacon army and stays by
Megatron's side only as a means to an end. He has studied military history,
particularly that of Decepticon lieutenants and their usual deceitful ways
of advancement through the ranks.

       Using an advanced hyper-wave sensor
array to triangulate potential threats, Terrorsaur can outmaneuver most
land- and air-based attacks. Armed with concussive missiles and laser blasters,
Terrorsaur is a terror not only in the air but also in ground assaults.
Each time Terrorsaur dismantles a Maximal in a dogfight or strafing run,
he imagines the day when it is Megatron in his crosshairs...
