    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RotF Legends class Optimus Prime

     There's not much "Power
Armor-y" about Power Armor Optimus Prime. He's basically in the same colors
as his original Legends class toy-- with nearly the same paint apps-- but
everything's been dulled down and darkened a bit. The red is a lot less
eye-catching and just looks really blah, almost rusty. The gray plastic
has been also dulled down a tad, but I think the biggest negative about
Power Armor Prime's color scheme is that his blue has been darkened and
dulled to such an extent it looks almost black-- which of course, doesn't
make it contrast well with the ACTUAL black plastic. The flame paint apps
on the front of the vehicle mode have also been darkened to a similar color.
The silver paint used on places like his windows, face, and shoulders is
still a nice color, but it's too little to make this guy stand out from
other versions of Prime.

     Power Armor Optimus
Prime takes Optimus Prime's traditional color scheme and makes everything
more blah, like he's being viewed under a dim light or something. And more
dull colors is not something that the movie aesthetic needs. Given the
multiple other releases of this mold, all with better color schemes, there's
really no reason to get this version of him unless you're a big Prime completist.
