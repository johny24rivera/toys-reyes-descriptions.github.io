    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Blast Off.

     Topspin's color scheme
is a bit of a nod to his G1 toy-- in terms of it being white with blue
being another main color-- but he's also a partial homage to the RiD Ruination
member
     <a href="movor.html">
      Movor
     </a>
     in terms of the orange. The white
plastic color that's used for most of Topspin is certainly appropriate
for a space shuttle-esque vehicle, though it also makes him look a bit
too similar to
     <a href="focg2bruticus.html">
      G2 Blast Off
     </a>
     , as well.
The two different shades of blue-- a darker periwinkle on the sides of
his legs and back, as well as the bits of lighter blue on his knees, chest,
eyes, and cockpit windows-- both contrast with the blue very well and complement
each other too-- they certainly look more interesting than just one shade
of blue would have. Silver paint on his engine "stripes" and some dark
brownish gray on his weapon and some minor connecting pieces help add a
neutral color to the scheme, though a more metallic, less brownish shade
of the gray would've looked better. The light orange is an accent color,
to be certain, but it contrasts with the blue stripes on the chest extremely
well and is quite eye-catching. That said, against the white the orange
is too bright to really contrast against that color much, and I'm glad
it wasn't used anymore than it was.

     Topspin, appropriately,
has a new head mold, based off of his G1 character. Unlike his G1 version,
though, his head's mostly white here, with his optic visor and forehead
vent blue and his face silver. I wish there had been a bit more blue to
call to mind the G1 character a bit more here, since his headsculpt is
otherwise so crisply detailed and so definitely G1-ish, but it still looks
quite good as is. A upgrade this mold gets when compared to Blast Off,
however, is that in addition to the two "wing guns" Topspin also has a
fairly large gun that-- when you push back on the lighter gray lever on
the side it-- has a sawblade come forward, spinning a bit as it does so,
while the front of the gunbarrel retracts into the weapon a bit. Unfortunately
it can't be locked into that "sawblade out" position, but I honestly don't
mind-- it's a really cool gimmick that calls to mind
     <a href="dotmratchet.html">
      Dark
of the Moon Ratchet's
     </a>
     , and is just fun to use again and again. It also
has some 5mm ports-- including the gun barrel-- so you can plug other weapons
ino this toy to make it even larger and more unwieldy for Topspin to handle.
(A port has also been molded into the top of the vehicle mode for this
weapon to mount easily in its center.)

     FoC Topspin's colors
are pretty fitting, and by themselves look good, even if I would've preferred
more blue to both make it more visually interesting and distinct from G2
Blast Off, and because I don't like the toy's color scheme "sorta homaging"
two completely different TFs at once (Topspin AND Movor). However, the
addition of a really nifty, solid weapon and great headsculpt puts him
above all the various releases of this mold except for the mass retail
version of Blast Off. Recommended.

       The conquest of new territories is just
as important to Autobot Topspin as the defeat of the Decepticons. Whenever
he's not charging into battle alongside his teammates, he can be found
alone in the galaxy's wildest places. He is an explorer and adventurer
at heart, with an unquenchable desire to see whatever mysteries lie behind
the next mountain.
