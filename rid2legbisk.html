    Bisk's lobster-car mode
makes it down to Legion size pretty darned well-- compared to his
    <a href="bisk.html">
     Warrior
class
    </a>
    toy, for example, there's almost a one-to-one correlation in
terms of the overall proportions, so they're largely spot on. The bottoms
of the feet stick up a bit behind the top hood, and lobster bits hanging
off the back end aren't quite as long/pointed (likely for safety/fragility
reasons), but otherwise things look pretty good. (If you wanted to get
REALLY picky, Bisk has no back end in this mode-- just the tops of his
robot knees-- but this is true on the Warrior class version, too, and on
a toy this small this is honestly to be expected.) The base orange color
for this version of Bisk is a milky orange, but it's also semi-metallic,
having a titch of glitter in it; it looks really good, almost like an orange
car finish, something I was NOT expecting on this small of a toy. The mold
detailing is pretty minimal-- beyond the barebones basics, you've just
got the basic grill-and-headlight details etched out, as well as the lobster
armor-like segments behind the front hood. However, the number of paint
apps visible on this mode make you able to ignore this slight downside
pretty easily. The tires are of course black plastic, but beyond that there's
black paint on the windows and front grill design; a fairly light blue
on the main headlights; and some dark dull red on the rear knees/lobster
bits and even on the teeny tiny Decepticon symbol in the middle of his
grill, something totally unexpected on this tiny toy. The black contrasts
against the orange pretty decently, and although I wish the dark dull red
was a bit darker to provide contrast, it's pretty good. As an accent color,
the light blue looks pretty good against the orange, too.

    Bisk's transformation
to robot mode is a simplified version of his Warrior toy; the legs fold
out from the rear, the front hood goes behind the head and body, and the
sides become his claws, with little bits flipping out from the bottom of
said claws to make them articulated. The front hood is a minor piece of
kibble in this mode, sticking up from the top of his back and behind his
lower body a bit, but it's relatively minor. My biggest issue with this
mode is honestly the claws; given how much of the side of the car mode
they make up, they're a bit too long and skinny, and this is exacerbated
by the lack of any knee articulation, so they look awkward in most poses,
even if the ability of the claws to articulate on such a small toy is appreciated.
The legs look pretty good overall-- the wheels stick out of the sides of
the knees, but for a Legion class toy this isn't really a huge deal. The
inside of his lower legs is actually painted black, like faux windows--
this is show-accurate, but something TOTALLY unexpected on this small of
a toy, and very much appreciated. The body, proportionally, is pretty nice,
with a fairly slim dull red waist and a fairly wide chest with the faux
car window detailed on the front (and interrupted by the allegiance symbol,
given the small scale). The headsculpt looks off, though. I mean, it has
all the right DETAILS there, but they're still off. The silver that is
on Bisk's mouth is painted across his entire face, which shouldn't be the
case. He has little blue-bug eyes-- you can't reasonably expect them to
stick out much at this scale-- and his little chin-antennae, which look
okay. His main antennae are WAY too tall, though, almost looking like exaggerated
cat ears proportionally. All this plus Bisk's head not hunching forward
a bit just makes this look a bit weak. For articulation, Bisk can move
at the shoulders (at two points), at the base of the lower part of each
claw, at the hips, and at the knees-- slightly above-average for a Legion
toy.

    Bisk is a good Legion
class toy, with a VERY solid alt mode, a particularly nice shade of orange
plastic, and generally good proportions in robot mode. He definitely has
a few downsides compared to his Warrior class toy-- beyond the expected
diminished articulation, his arms are a bit oddly proportioned and his
head is weirdly sculpted-- but if you're wanting a tiny Bisk for your Legion
class toys, this'll do.
