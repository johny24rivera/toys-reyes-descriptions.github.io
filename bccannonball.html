    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime deluxe
Ratchet. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Cannonball is an homage
to one of the most (in?)famous redecoes of all time-- the redeco of the
     <a href="cycannonball.html">
      same
name
     </a>
     from the Cybertron line, to be precise. It was such a weird, funky
redeco, you pretty knew he was gonna show up again at some point, and here
he is! This version of Cannonball is a bit more angular than the original
due to the Prime Ratchet aesthetic, but shares his original version's alt
mode of a weird-looking ambulance, so it works pretty well. Pretty much
everything you'd expect from the original Cannonball's paint job is replicated
pretty faithfully on this version-- his main colors are black and silver,
with a fair amount of bronzish gold plastic and paint-- the latter of which
primarily shows itself in robot mode, on the shoulders, waist, upper legs
and upper arms, and a few other minor parts. (It should be mentioned that
the painted and plastic versions of the bronzish gold are noticeably different--
the paint is a bit duller, oddly--- but only just so. They both still look
prety good, even next to each other.) All three colors go together exceptionaly
well-- I particularly love how the molded-in lines are painted silver on
the back top of the ambulance mode-- it looks quite nice and unexpected
among Cannonball's myriad other paint apps. Cannonball also has silver
all around his bottom rims and at the center of his tires, around the center
middle of his vehicle mode in a way that mirrors his original paint scheme.
Cannonball also has yellow headlights, purple sirens and purple paint on
all the windows that aren't transparent. (That said, the windows that ARE
transparent are a bit too light in terms of the shade of purple used--
I would've preferred a darker transparent color.) Of course, Cannonball
also has-- VERY faithfully recreated-- the bizarre seafoam green "skeletron
being run over" paint apps on the sides and the "flaming skull" paint on
the roof, though given that there's less real estate on the top this time
the latter looks just a TAD "cramped in". This seafoam green goes quite
well with Cannonball's status as Star Seeker captain, given that that same
color is the color of the emblem of the Star Seekers and is on Cannonball's
collar in robot mode. There are also a couple other ingenious paint apps
done; in particular I love how the robot chest details-- originally made
to be miniatured versions of Prime Ratchet's side doors-- are here painted
to look like Cannonball's front bumper and headlights. It's amazing how
well that works. The bronzish gold on his waist also makes it look like
he has a belt on-- certainly fitting for his character, as does the mold's
collar around the head Making Cannonball's swords gold was a good call,
as it emphasizes them more, which fit the character better than the original
version's medic tools.

     Cannonball does have
one mold change-- a new headsculpt based faithfully on
     <a href="cyredalert.html">
      Cybertron
Red Alert's
     </a>
     , and it's all quite crisp and well-done. No complaints
about the headsculpt itself, but rather the usage of it on Cannonball.
The original Cannonball had half of his face painted black to liken itself
to an eyepatch because there wasn't budget for a new headsculpt; however,
this time around Cannonball's head is the one and only use of this head
mold, so why does he still have the full visor? FunPub missed a PERFECT
opportunity to give him a "real" patch with a detail like a plate bolted
over half of his visor or something. Additionally, Cannonball's upper leg
pieces were unfortunately switched during assembly, and they can't be "made
right" without taking out pins, a very risky proposition on a toy this
expensive. For the most part it's not a huge deal, but this can cause the
paint on these parts to slowly scrap off after multiple transformations/poses,
so caution is recommended.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     BotCon Cannonball is
pretty much a perfect example of what BotCon exclusives should be-- incredibly
well-done redecoes of fairly obscure characters that probably wouldn't
get a mass-release. Mold-wise this isn't the best toy in the 2014 boxset,
but I absolutely LOVE his color scheme and all the paint on him-- color-wise
this is my favorite from the boxset. The only real missed opportunity was
his headsculpt.

       He rules through charm and subterfuge, rather than force and intimidation
(not that he isn't capable of both). While he may prefer a more subtle
approach, this bot is a skilled swordsman and an accomplished warrior.
His hands are capable of transforming into a variety of armaments, but
being a true swashbuckler, his weapons of choice are a pair of golden dueling
daggers. When these are drawn, it's almost certain that the decks will
be stained with mech fluid.

       His crew is a ragtag group of mixed
bots and beasts, with an army of Dread Pirate Crew troopers at his beck
and call. He prefers that his enemies underestimate him, and puts on a
false veneer of simple desires: that of simply pillaging and plundering.
In his spark, his truest wish is to become a legend; that of being the
greatest pirate of all time by pulling off the greatest heist ever contemplated
in Cybertron's history.
