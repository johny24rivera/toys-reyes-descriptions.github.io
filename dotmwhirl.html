    Whirl's alt mode is a
sort of personal helicopter, as it's a little "skeleton-y" compared to
most other helicopter Transformers. Considering that, though, the proportions
are pretty good on this, and the robot mode extras are pretty minimal.
The back end obviously has the robot hands molded into them, and on a lesser
note, the parts of the helicopter to the sides are kind of obviously his
robot legs, but the latter's not a big deal at all, and understandable
given the scale. The mold detailing is decent enough, though not outstanding
when compared with most other toys of a simliar size-- there's the occasional
really detailed bit like where his rotors converge or on the sides, but
generally he's got what is needed in terms of mold detailing and not a
whole lot more. The color scheme is a bit on the unique side for a Transformer--
there aren't too many mostly brown TFs. The light milky gray is a blah
color and I wish it wasn't used even as much as it is as a secondary color,
but having some of the silver painted gray was a nice touch, and the black
helps provide another dark color to contrast against the gray. The paint
apps of bright orange, red, and white also look quite well against the
brown and/or light gray, so no complaints there. As you'd expect from a
Human Alliance figure, Whirl has a peg hole in his cockpit area for Major
Sparkplug or some other Human Alliance human figurine to fit in, and there's
also handles for that figure to grasp the "controls" in the cockpit. (As
for Major Sparkplug, he's your typical soldier human figurine-- nothing
special, here. He has all the standard points of movement that pretty much
every other human figurine in this subline has.) As far as other features,
Whirl's rotor rotates quite well, offering little resistance. He also has
two machine gun emplacements on C-clips, which can be used on four different
places on his rotor tail. In addition, those weapons also have two additional
bars on each to allow for more C-clip weapons to be attached to THEM, so
you can give Whirl quite a lot of firepower if you so desire.

    Whirl's weapon mode
is essentially his helicopter mode turned on its rear end with the rotors
combined together to look like a large railgun and the side pieces and
cockpit slightly rearranged so that it looks like a genuine "protection
cage" for the human figurine piloting him. The rotor-rail gun is a really
creative usage, and the missile packs and guns on the sides definitely
give this mode firepower, but otherwise it's a pretty weak weapon mode.
The tail rotor section hanging down doesn't even try to look like anything,
as do some of the parts on the sides of the vehicle. Like most weapon modes
from the subline, it's best ignored.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    All of the pieces come
together quite well in robot mode, which is arguably Whirl's best mode.
The rotor on his back is the only real vehicle mode extra in this mode,
and it enhances the silouhette of the figure-- plus it can still rotate
in this mode, and if you REALLY dislike it, it can slide off and be put
aside. The proportions are a tad off, with his arms being a little small
and short, while his hips stick out way too much from his body. (His arms
also can't hold any weapons, either, which is a bummer.) On the plus side,
the skis on the feet really help to give his design some more uniqueness,
and are a throwback to G1 Whirl's feet as well. The cockpit bits compress
quite impressively to form a chest that doesn't stick out TOO much from
the head-- and the head itself is a completely new design and looks great,
particularly with the orange and bronze paint apps on the forehead and
sides. The black faceplate paint does mesh a little too well visually with
his pale blue transparent visor, so they're rather indistinguishable from
each other in most light. (The visor's light piping doesn't work too well,
for some reason.) As far as weaponry, Whirl also has C-clip points on his
shoulders, so his rotary guns can still be mounted in a good position this
mode. His articulation is pretty good for the size, too; he can move at
the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), hips, knees
(at three points), and ankles (at two points). Given his wide stance and
lack of back-heavyness, this means he can take on a pretty good number
of poses.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Dark of the Moon Whirl
is one of the better molds in the Human Alliance deluxe line, with a pretty
solid robot mode and a vehicle mode with only a few minor kibble problems.
His weapon mode is pretty crummy (railgun aside), but it doesn't impact
the other modes and can be easily ignored. Mildly recommended.

      Autobot Whirl prefers to observe what
occurs around him and base his strategy on the information he gathers.
His human partner Major Sparkplug agrees, having spent much of his life
behind enemy lines and deep undercover.
