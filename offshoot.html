    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Signal Flare. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Signal Flare

     Offshoot's color scheme
seems to be leaps and bounds above Signal Flare's, and Signal Flare's wasn't
that bad to begin with. Offshoot has quite an original color scheme- green,
blue, and red, with some bits of red, tan, and black thrown in. And reading
it, you wouldn't think it works. But, looking at the toy, it really, really
does. He's got just the right amounts of each color in just the right places
where it all fits together perfectly. The gold on the blue parts looks
especially great. Not to mention that "Offshoot" kinda reminds me of a
plant, and given the amount of green on him, it kinda points in that direction.
The only complaint I have about his color scheme is the odd blue-green
"worn" patterns used on the rear treads. On the blue of Signal Flare, it
looked okay, but it doesn't sit right on the light green of Offshoot. It
looks too weird and fake.

     Offshoot's Energon color
is the same basic color as on Signal Flare-- red-- but it's a bit darker,
more muted color of red this time. It still fits in nicely with his color
scheme, though, and I can understand the decision given the "Red= Autobot
Energon" theme for the line, so I don't mind it.

     Offshoot takes all the
features of Signal Flare, but applies a much more original and fitting
color scheme to the mold. It's also just great to look at. Recommended
over Signal Flare.

       Offshoot is the twin brother of Omnicon
Signal Flare. Like his brother, he is a skilled energon welder and weapons
craftsman. Unlike Signal Flare, Offshoot is not very dedicated to his work.
He feels that welding Energon is more of a burdensome task then a true
artform. He would rather fight in battle then work the energon mines. Optimus
Prime has noticed this Omnicon's impressive fighting skills when thwarting
Terrorcon attacks and has asked him to accompany his team on several offensives
against the Decepticons. Though a skilled warrior, Offshoot often lets
his guard down during battle when trying to impress his Autobot comrades.
