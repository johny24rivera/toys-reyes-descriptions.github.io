not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Classics Snarl toy.

     Catilla is the only one
of the secondary retailer exclusive DotM "Dinobots" that isn't based upon
a past G1 Dinobot, but rather, loosely on the G1 character of the same
name. G1 Catilla was a sabretooth tiger as well, and his main color was
yellow while this guy's main color is a dull glittery brown-- so the alt
mode is pretty much the only thing connecting this toy to G1 Catilla. Leaving
all that aside, Catilla "switches up" the colors to a certain extent compared
to the other Mini-Con Dinobots in his assortment, with his main color being
bronze by far and the silver only being a secondary color. Both colors
contrast well and look great together-- the bronze is a semi-metallic shade
with some glitter in the plastic, while the silver-gunmetal is all paint.
He still has a few other accent colors to mix things up a bit more, though,
like a few light red paint apps against the bronze, dark blue cat eyes,
and a black head in robot mode. All of the accent colors go together with
their surrounding colors and prevent any one area on Catilla from consisting
of too much of one color, though his beast eyes are such a dark shade of
blue that they're essentially black under all but very strong light.

     Dark of the Moon Catilla
is probably the most original out of the group of Dark of the Moon "Dinobots",
since it's based on a lesser-known character. The mold itself is very weak
in robot mode, but the colors and paint apps on this guy are quite good--
my favorite out of the various releases of this mold.
