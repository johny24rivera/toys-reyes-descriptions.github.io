    Grimlock's back again
as a robotic T-Rex. Generally, this mode looks pretty good, and is definitely
recognizable as Grimlock, right down to the gold band around his neck.
The overall color scheme is admittedly a bit dull, however, as two shades
of gray with a bit of black and gold admittedly aren't all that eye-catching.
Still, it's Grimlock's classic color scheme, so I can hardly blame the
toy designers for that. I do like the black paint wash used on the main
body, however-- it really helps to bring out Grimlock's ample mold detailing.
Grimlock's overall proportions are pretty good, though I really don't like
the way his head is sculpted. It took me a while to figure out what looked
so "off" about it, but I finally did-- it's the puffed-out "cheekbones".
They really make Grimlock look odd, especially since tyrannosaurs never
had cheeks like that. That, combined with the all-too-flat forehead, makes
Grimlock look more like an angry gremlin than a T-rex, if you're just going
by his face. For a dinosaur mode, Grimlock has pretty good articulation--
he can move at the shoulders, the jaw, up-and-down at the neck, side-to-side
at four seperate points at the tail, and three points at the hips, two
points at the knees, and at the ankles. He can even rotate at the waist,
especially rare for a dino Transformer. However, his hips aren't really
held to his body by much at all, so they tend to come undone from the body
really easily. I do like how his gun-sword begs into his back in this mode,
however-- who said having a dino mode meant Grimlock couldn't have any
long-range weapons? Grimlock's allegiance rub symbol is on his main body,
on the left side.

    In robot mode, Grimlock
looks rough 'n tough, with bulky arms and a very nice head sculpt with
excellent light piping for the visor. (It could have used some paint detailing,
however.) The asymmetrical transparent red bulb on his chest is also a
really cool detail, as well. He has articulation at the head, shoulders
(at three points), elbows, waist, hips, knees, and ankles-- however, it's
restricted a bit by all of Grimlock's kibble, especially when it comes
to the legs. And that's Grimlock's biggest problem-- in the effort to give
him a unique transformation, the designers made his transformation a bit
overly complicated, and instead of improving on the original G1 design
they made the design much more kibbly. I really don't like his there's
shells of his dino body around his lower legs, or how his dino feet hang
off the back of his hands. Normally I wouldn't have any problem with his
feet being made from his dino head, but the jaws don't flatten out all
the way to give Grimlock flat feet-- they're slanted, which makes Grimlock's
stability a bit less than it would have been otherwise. There's also several
little panels that just hang off his backside, without pegging into anything.
In addition, his shoulders (hips in dino mode) still don't peg into his
body nearly as well as they should, though I've been told that this has
been fixed to a limited extent on later releases of the toy. As for his
weapons, his tail whip is admittedly pretty lame and un-whip-like, though
at least it can store easily on his back. His bayonet missile launcher
is pretty cool, though I wish the hand peg could rotate to the bottom of
the weapon so that the sword portion of the weapon could actually be used
as a sword instead of just a "poker". The missile launcher can also store
on Grimlock's back in this mode, though all the little aforementioned panels
can get in the way a bit.

    Classics Grimlock is
a bit of a dissapointment-- his dinosaur mode looks cool, except for the
oddly-shaped head, but his robot mode is way too kibbly. It actually is
worse than the original G1 toy in several ways. My least favorite of the
"mainline deluxe and voyager" Classics toys, though he's still not an outright
bad mold, just fairly mediocre.

      Grimlock keeps a collection of the parts
he's torn off his Decepticon enemies. His super-thick ultramantium skin
in both robot and dinosaur mode is coated in energy-absorbing materials,
making him nearly impervious to damage. There are many who might say much
the same thing about his mind. He is acutally quite smart, but a programming
flaw in his speech cneters gives him only the most basic communications
skills. He dislikes the weak, but is dedicated to the protection of those
he views as lesser creatures. The only thing he hates more than weakness,
in fact, is those who exploit the weak.
