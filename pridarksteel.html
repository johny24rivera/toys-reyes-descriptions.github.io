    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Prime Grimwing. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Prime Grimwing

     This is one of the very
few times in TF history where the original release of a mold-- Grimwing--
never appeared in official fiction, but the redeco is actually in the show,
having a role in the "Predacons Rising" mini-movie that is the epilogue
to the Prime series. Unfortunately, his model on the show only shares the
"big strokes" in terms of the design, with the toy being much bulkier and
more round than the show model-- though the show model was created later,
so I can't really fault the toy in this instance. As far as the new color
scheme goes, Darksteel lives up to how name by having a lot of both light
and dark gray paint and plastic on him, to give him a more colder, "steelier"
look. Thankfully, neither of the shades of gray are of the particularly
milky, blah shade-- both are fairly flat in their appearance. This is alright,
but adding a bit more of a metallic shade to the gray really would've helped
more here. Thankfully, the gray is broken up by a lot of dark flat navy
blue, which contrasts with all the other colors excellently, and also helps
to tie in Darksteel thematically with is Predacon "brother", Sky Lynx.
Oddly, just the tail is a slightly different shade of dark blue, being
more of a dark perwinkle compared to navy blue. There's also a bit of black
on the figure, such as on the beast heads and sides of the chest, but it
blends in so much with the dark blue that it's not really noticeable. No,
what really stands out on this figure are the excellent bright orange accents,
which both highlight many of the "Cyberglyphs" on his wings and arms and
also helps his heads (in both modes) and his weapon-head stand out quite
a bit. The color just goes especially well with the dark blue, and upgrades
what would be a fairly dull color scheme to one with a bit more of a punch
to it.

     Darksteel is generally
a pretty decent redeco of the Grimwing mold in colors that are definitely
more pleasing overall. I wish Darksteel had a bit more of that bright orange
for accents, and that his grays were a bit more metallic for shade, but
overall he's pretty nice-looking and a solid addition to your Prime Predacon
collection. (That said, he's not all that accurate to his show model in
terms of the details, but unfortunately as far as Prime Darksteel toys
go this is all you've got.)
