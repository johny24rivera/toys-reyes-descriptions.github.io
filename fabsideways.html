    Magna Missile Sideways'
vehicle mode has no robot mode extra whatsoever, but its proportions are
one of the most "squished" out of any of the Fast Action Battlers. It's
more than half as wide as it is long! For a REALLY small-kiddy line like,
say, Gravity Bots, I wouldn't have a problem with, but most of the FABs
have fairly realistic proportions, and it seems kinda pointless to make
Sideways look so "Playskool-ish" in vehicle mode given the look of most
of the rest of line... as well as his own face design, for one! The mold
detailing is a tad on the sparse side, given both the fact that he's a
sleek sportscar and that he's in a line aimed at younger children-- though
the rear engine detailing is quite nice. The color scheme isn't exactly
the most exciting-- being mostly dull gray and black-- but he looks a lot
more dynamic here than on the mainline toy, due to the sleeker, more movie-accurate
paint job where the black stripe comes back from his front grill to sweep
over his roof. (It also helps to break up the gray more, as well.) The
dark blue really works well with the dark color scheme as well, and all
the necessary paint apps-- such as the headlights and taillights-- are
here, too.

    Sideways' robot mode
certainly suffers a little from "simplification syndrome" due to the line's
nature, but all things considered it's still quite alright. His legs are
overly stiff-looking due to them being made out of just the sides of the
car mode with no elbow movement, and the legs are a bit short, making his
stature a bit gorilla-ish. At least his feet are actually large enough
to keep him stable though, unlike the other Sideways molds, and I do like
that despite the transformation simpliciation they still gave him the movie-accurate
ability to put up those pieces of his windshield over his shoulders like
insect wings. There's a few minor vehicle mode "kibble" parts like the
roof panel behind his back and the rear bumper shells on his lower legs,
but generally stay out of the way so I don't mind them too much. The mold
detailing on his robot parts is GREAT, with tons of great, evil-looking
detailing on his arms and head, in particular (which is why it clashes
so much with his chunky vehicle mode). Like most Fast Action Battlers,
Sideways doesn't exactly have great articulation-- he can move at the shoulders,
waist, hips, and his knees, though his knees are quite restricted and can't
move backwards much. As for his gimmick, he can fire a rotating "sawblade"
wheel out of his right arm if you slide back a lever, which is pretty cool.

    in some ways, such as having larger feet, a cool gimmick, and a
movie-accurate paint job in car mode. Overly stiff arms, bad articulation
and a chunky vehicle mode are his only problems that I would consider not
"necessary" given the FAB line's nature.

      Sideways usually relies on his speed
to stay out of fights. When he does have to fight, he likes to make the
other guy run, if he can. His magna missiles lock onto the metal of his
opponent's armor and chase their target anywhere it goes. While that happens,
Sideways kicks back and laughs.
