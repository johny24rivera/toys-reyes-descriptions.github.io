    Sentinel Prime's alt
mode is a rather hefty Rosenbauer fire truck. As is the case with most
licensed vehicle modes, this mode is pretty spot-on accurate in terms of
proportions, with only the ladder/hose (which can move at two points at
the base and another point about a third of the way up) being a bit too
short proportionally, likely so it doesn't stick out too much in robot
mode. The only real extras are the parts that can be seen on the front
of this mode-- the interior chest piece in particular sticks out a bit
if you're looking at Sentinel from a relatively straight-on angle, and
the clear plastic used for his windows makes his head incredibly obvious,
just sitting there in the middle behind the window like it does. (There's
also no molded interior, which is a bit of a bummer at this scale.) Sentinel's
main shield weapon stores on the underside of this mode and can stick out
a tad in front of the rear tires, but if it bugs you that much you can
always simply detach it and put it aside. The color scheme is certainly
appropriate for a fire truck, being mostly dull red, black, and gray. The
gray's rather boring (if movie-accurate)-- I would've preferred white in
its place-- but otherwise the color scheme is decent enough for the more
realistic tones of the movie toys. There's a fair bit of silver paint on
the red to change things around a little, like the Autobot symbols near
the back, a silver line down the sides with the Rosenbauer emblem on it,
and a bit of lettering like "316" and "FIRE RESCUE". His headlights and
taillights are also painted off-white and yellow, and his transparent light
blue sirens give a tad more color variation at the front end. I would've
preferred a bit more paint on the gray or the black (like the wheel hubs,
for instance) to make things a bit more visually interesting, however--
he's still a tad bare there. As far as electronics, pressing the small
gray button behind the sirens will cause them to blink orange while a siren
wail is emitted from the toy.

    Sentinel Prime's transformation
is both straightforward and complex at the same time. A lot of his alt
mode simply folds up behind his back or waist in robot mode, and his arms
fold out in a very simple transformation. However, there's one sticking
point no matter which way you're transforming him-- if it's from vehicle
to robot, it's the chest that's rather difficult to remember how exactly
to get everything to line up; if you're going to vehicle mode, it's getting
the legs in just the right position to close up the back end. As such,
I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone who hates difficult transformations,
as it'll take several times before you get the "gist" of it, particularly
for the legs. An interesting bit here is that the difficult parts are the
most ingenious parts of his robot mode-- the way the entire front folds
up into his chest in such a "fragmented" look that emulates the movie model
so well is incredible, and everything locks into place securely. The way
the lower legs fold around themselves with only a little bit of obvious
"vehicle paneling" forming the heels is also awesome, and his legs are
pretty beefy without looking too blocky. He's remarkably movie-accurate
in this mode, with his arms being a bit short but otherwise his proportions
being pretty darned spot-on. Unfortunately, the entire top of his vehicle
mode just hangs behind his back, along with a few large side panels hanging
off the back sides of his shoulders and waist (though the latter looks
like a "skirt"). Granted, in the movie this whole bit moves and acts like
a "cape" of sorts, but in hard plastic it's just a bunch of backpack kibble.
Even with his somewhat substantial feet and heels, he can fall over on
his back quite easily, as back-heavy as all this stuff makes him. The ratcheting
joints-- at least on mine-- are also a little weaker than they should be
to hold up Sentinel Prime, which of course only makes this worse. The detailing
is definitely more intricate for this mode, with the head, hips, and shoulders
looking particularly well-detailed in terms of decorative mold and paint
detailing. The addition of bronze and more silver really helps Sentinel
Prime look less boring color-wise in this mode compared to his vehicle
configuration. As for articulation, Sentinel can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at two points), wrists, at the mid-points of his
curled fingers on each hand (with all four fingers on one joint), and at
the hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles (at FOUR points!).
Most of the major points are ratcheted too, with the only major articulation
points missing being the waist and a way for his head to look up or down.
As for weaponry, Sentinel comes with an awesomeÂ  (albeit a bit small
proportionally) double-bladed sword that his hands can grasp fairly well,
as well as a Mechtech shield that, with the press of a button, converts
into a blaster (though it's admittedly not much of a transformation, just
a few parts popping out or sliding further open). That said, this weapon
can actually STAY in either mode, unlike most Mechtech weapons, which is
certainly a welcome feature. The handle on the back side of the shield
is also adjustable, though you'll need to use one of the pegs on the backside
and slot it into Sentinel's lower arm if you want him to wield the shield
as a blaster. For electronics, you can access his siren sounds by pressing
the same button mentioned earlier, AND if you press the gray-and-copper
button slightly below his neck, his mouth will open slightly, his eyes
will flash orange, and he'll say "I am Sentinel Prime!" in a voice that
is nowhere near Leonard Nimoy's-- just a generic deep-sounding hero's voice,
sadly. I do wish he a greater variety of electronic sounds, as well.

    Leader Sentinel Prime
has an incredibly accurate robot mode and a pretty impressive vehicle mode
to boot. His weaponry is also pretty darned awesome, as is the way his
legs and chest transform. That said, he's a bit of a chore to transform
and all his back kibble is quite a downside in robot mode. If you want
a simpler version of the character, I'd go for the cheaper
    <a href="dotmcysentinel.html">
     Cyberverse
version
    </a>
    of the character. If you want a "mainline"-sized Sentinel Prime
toy, though, this is definitely the one to go for. Recommended-- the best
Leader class toy in the line.

      Sentinel Prime is a legendary warrior,
thought lost long ago. The strength of his will and the power of his sword
are spoken of in reverent whispers by Autobot and Decepticon alike. Now
that he has returned, the final defeat of Megatron and the Decepticons
