    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is one of his more accurate toys, with a fairly movie-accurate version
of his Chevrolet Camaro alt mode, with the small spoiler in the back and
longer front bumper that's characteristic of his model in the film. Proportionally
everything is spot-on in this mode, with ALMOST no robot mode extras; you
can see just a BIT of his chest plate below the middle of the car mode,
and his heels below the back end, but that's it. All of the needed mold
details are here-- the Camaro-esque front grill, the edgy and extended
front lower bumper, the vents on the front hood, the spoiler, and the slim
lines on the rear end. The wheels also have some nice small treads on them
as well. Unfortunately, as is par for the course for the TLK line, when
it comes to paint it's another story. He does have black across much of
the top, as you'd expect, and there's also some black paint on his front
grill, and yellow on many of the details on his rear end. However, there
still needed to be a better variety of colors here; with the exception
of the tiny bit of metallic bronze on his all-important Chevy logo on the
grill, he's ALL either black or orangish yellow in this mode. His windshield
and rear window COMPLETELY blend in with the black stripe on the top, and
definitely should've been painted another color like light blue or silver.
His headlights also definitely needed some paint. That would've been enough
honestly, but to up the wishlist further the obvious door handles and taillights
also could've used some paint.

    To transform Bumblebee
to his robot mode, pull apart the rear sections and fold them out and down
to become his robot legs, and the rest of the figure will open up/auto-transform.
The end result looks fairly similar to the
    <a href="rid23stepblizdrift.html">
     RID2015
Drift 3-step changer
    </a>
    , with the side rear chunks of the car forming
the legs, the front chunks forming the shoulders and upper arms, and the
car doors forming the sides of his lower arms. (The roof is on his back,
and out of the way visually in this mode.) There's a pretty big positive
with going with this general idea, as it keeps Bumblebee pretty kibble-free
in both modes while also giving him a very simple transformation. Sure
his shoulders are a bit bigger with some extra bits of the car mode on
them, and his lower legs are a bit blockier than they should be, but when
it comes to simplified transformers these little bits of kibble are small
potatoes. The problem here is that instead of using a push-pull locking
mechanism like Hasbro did on the RID2015 3-step Drift toy, this time around
the legs just expand out and down on a hinge system-- one with NO LOCKING
MECHANISM. I can't overstate what a huge mistake this was, and it's by
a large margin my biggest problem with this toy. Because the legs don't
lock into place, gravity causes this toy to "sag" noticeably at the knees,
with the lower legs sliding out to the sides a bit when they should come
more-or-less straight down from the upper legs. This also causes the shoulders
to be up a bit higher due to everything being interconnected because of
the transformation. As if that wasn't enough, it ALSO causes Bumblebee
to be rather unstable, as his legs don't have a solid foundation and can
give a little if you put him down on a surface a little unevenly. Still,
overlooking that BIG issue, Bumblebee's proportions are otherwise fairly
good outside of the aforementioned minor bits of kibble, and his upper
legs, which are oddly more like his hip details extended down the entire
length of said upper legs, what with the yellow bits on the sides. Still,
other than that the mold detailing is quite impressive, with the usual
movie 'Bee details on the legs and fold-out feet, silver robotic details
on his arms, and the faux car front-chest. Bumblebee's headsculpt is also
pretty accurate, with all the necessary details very well-sculpted. The
only slight oddity is his "ears" have been elongated a bit at the sides,
as that's where the pivot point is for his special "Knight Helmet". And
speaking of the helmet gimmick, pressing down on the small button in the
middle of his chest has the helmet flip down over his normal face. It looks
pretty cool, like a more "EXTREME" version of his AoE mask, with multiple
sets of slitted eyes this time and what look like multiple antennae off
the sides, with most of it painted a light blue. With the exception of
his chest, which is bare, Bumblebee is actually painted pretty well in
this mode, with a good amount of silver paint all over his arms, his pelvis,
and on his face. There's a bit of light blue on his eyes and a decent amount
of yellow paint on the black pieces that make up his legs, too. As such,
even though he's still mostly black and yellow (he IS Bumblebee, after
all), his colors are broken up considerably better in this mode than in
vehicle mode. For articulation, Bumblebee can move back-and-forth at the
elbows, which is pretty much the standard for this subline.

Bumblebee is painful, because for a simplistic toy it was SO CLOSE to being
one of the best. Little kibble in both modes, a good color break-up in
robot mode, a nifty flip-down helmet gimmick, great mold detailing... all
he would've needed would've been some more paint colors in car mode and
maybe another point of articulation or two (can't get too picky on that
last point for these simplistic TFs, given the age they're aimed at). But
making the absolutely HORRID choice to put his lower legs on hinges instead
of pull-and-lock mechanisms means he sags in robot mode, ruining the look
of his legs and hunching his shoulders up too much. Oh, and it makes him
unstable too, which I'm sure will delight little kiddies trying to stand
him up straight. Because of that sole huge downside I'd recommend this
the
    <i>
     last
    </i>
    out of all the Knight Armor Turbo Changer figures. This
design needed more time in the QC department.
