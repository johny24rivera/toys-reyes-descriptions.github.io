    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 3-step Bumblebee

     As with his wave-mate
     <a href="rid23stepprime17.html">
      Optimus
Prime
     </a>
     , the (first) 2017 version of 3-step Bumblebee has been changed
to more accurately reflect his
     <a href="rid2actbee.html">
      Activator Combiner
toy
     </a>
     with its gimmick deployed. The transformation and basic design
is the same here, but there's been a couple of major mold changes. The
most obvious is that the middle of the shoulders have been overhauled,
as well as the back middle portion of the vehicle mode. On the back portion
of that vehicle mode, the rear window is smaller, but has a raised port
that you can put a Mini-Con Weaponizer or accessory with a similar-sized
peg into. It's surrounded by a couple of mechanical details as well, though
the biggest mold details added are large extensions made to make the shoulders
in robot mode (or back sides of the vehicle) quite wide in both modes.
There's lots of power circuitry-like lines on this new wider area, along
with rectangular thruster-like details that emphasize Bumblebee has some
oomph in alt mode (and they can double as shoulder-blasters in robot mode).
The other major mold changes have been made to the front hood/bumper pieces,
which become the lower legs in robot mode. They've been completely changed,
with the stripe patterns made a bit different on the hood, with no angular
bits around the trio of divots on the front hood. The front wheels have
been extended out a bit, though not nearly as much as the rear wheels,
and there's more of that circuitry detailing around the wheels-- again,
like part of the toy has "popped out" a bit, even though that's not the
case on this toy. The front bumper is also a bit more fragmented and detailed,
as if it's been partially reconfigured as well. In general this makes for
a bigger, meaner-looking alt mode, though the shoulders don't compress
anymore during transformation, so the vehicle mode doesn't look as solid
as it used to, with obvious hollow gaps on those "extended" parts around
the rear and front wheels.

     As for the color scheme,
it's mostly the same as you'd expect on Bumblebee, with the major change
being the addition of light blue on all those circuitry details around
the front and back wheels. There's also more of that light blue on the
trio of angled divots on the front hood, the headlights, the underside
of his thrusters, the faux headlights on his chest, and on the center vent
on 'Bee's forehead and on his eyes. Black paint has also been added more
to the front hood and on the front bumper, along with higher places on
the shoulders. Otherwise, the placement of colors and plastic breakup is
basically the same as on the original. The only real change-- very slight--
is that the yellow used for this version of Bumblebee is a more milky,
slightly duller shade than the more "solid, pure" yellow used on the original.
Personally I think the more solid yellow looked better on 'Bee.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The first 2017 3-step
version of RID2015 Bumblebee has some neat, detailed mold changes that
give Bumblebee a more futuristic, "teched-out" look compared to his other
versions, and some missile packs on his shoulders in robot mode. In general
I feel the robot mode looks a little better than the original, but with
slightly less of a transformation and those ugly gaps, the vehicle mode
looks a fair bit worse. Overall I'd give the original version a SLIGHT
edge over this toy because of the vehicle mode, but they're still both
great large, simple toys.
