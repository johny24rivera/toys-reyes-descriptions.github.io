    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Hunters
commander Shockwave. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Beast Hunters commander Shockwave figure

    .)

     Well, this isn't what
I would've guessed they would have remolded Shockwave into, but I'll definitely
take it. Beast Hunters Bludgeon takes many cures from his
     <a href="rotfbludgeon2.html">
      Revenge
of the Fallen figure
     </a>
     , as he's got a color scheme based his "inner robot"
from his G1 version but also has some aspects of his robot mode that call
back to that same version's Pretender shell of a skeleton samurai. Bludgeon's
main colors are a dark military green, light orange, and black. The orange
works the best here, providing excellent contrast against all the colors,
but especially the black. The dark green helps to tie Bludgeon to his tank
mode via giving him "typical" tank colors (even if his tank mode is an
alien "Cybertronian" tank). The black on the robot feet and treads-- as
well as the bluish gray used for some minor robot pieces-- serve as nice
neutral colors for Bludgeon's other shades to work off of without making
the color scheme look overly loud. Plus, Bludgeon's gray is a duller, bluish
gray, so it doesn't look quite as boring as the usual light milky gray
plastic that's used for gray on many TFs these days. Bludgeon has a surprising
number of accent colors that are used sparingly-- for example, the silver
just on his cannon; the bone white on just his face; and the dark reddish
brown on just his helmet and shoulder details. These help to mix things
up a little and look nice, but neither of them is prevalent enough to really
matter in terms of the overall color scheme.

     Bludgeon has two mold
changes when compared to Shockwave; first, the head has been remolded into
a really fearsome, red-eyed robotic skull samurai, who just looks about
as evil as you can get for a character in a kids' toy line. The bone white
particularly pops, and it's just an amazingly detailed sculpt for such
a small piece. The robot chest/vehicle front also has a similarly red-eyed
demon-skull face molded onto it, which helps Bludgeon look even more fearsome--
particularly in vehicle mode, where it gives him a "face". Additionally--
because Bludgeon just ain't Bludgeon without a sword-- he comes with the
same sword accessory that Beast Hunter commander-class
     <a href="pricybhprime.html">
      Optimus
Prime
     </a>
     comes with, with his painted red. It's an appreciated little
extra, and you can stick it in a hole in either of his treads for storage.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Beast Hunters Bludgeon
is quite the imaginative remold, and does a great job of both homaging
his G1 alt mode and Pretender shell while "modernizing" his design a bit.
The new sculpting is incredibly well-done, and the color scheme is decent
enough and more fitting of a tank than Shockwave's purple. All of this
said, this is still the Cyberverse Shockwave mold, and as such his vehicle
mode is still just awful. (Plus, he only saw a limited release outside
of the U.S., so he's going to go for more than your usual Commander class
figure.) If you want a modern version of the character, I'd recommend getting
his Revenge of the Fallen verison instead.
