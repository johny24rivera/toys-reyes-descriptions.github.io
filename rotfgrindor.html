    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Blackout w/ Scorponok toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Movie Voyager Blackout w/ Scorponok toy

     Grindor isn't Blackout,
no sir! He's totally his own character... who's never named in the movie...
and looks very similar to Blackout in said movie. Anyways, because of this
his toy isn't exactly all that movie-accurate, given they needed to make
the toy different enough to warrant it being a different character. For
this iteration, he's primarily an off-whitish gray and black. It's a decent
color combo-- after all, they certainly contrast against each other very
well-- but it does look a bit boring in vehicle mode. There's some pretty
big spaces of unpainted plastic along the back of said mode, as he doesn't
have nearly as many paint apps as voyager class Blackout does. One triangle/arrow
on each side is about it as far as "aircraft markings" go. His windows
are still painted, though, and the couple of yellow spots help to keep
him from being completely monochfome in vehicle mode. In robot mode he
looks a bit more visually striking, as not only is the black more prevalent
to help break up all that whitish gray, but he's also got some really nice
pale metallic gold paint apps on some of his robot parts that look particularly
good against the black. The miniature Scorponok he comes with shares the
same Beast Wars homage colors as the deluxe

     RotF Grindor has a pretty
nice-lloking robot mode, but that's pretty much entirely because of how
well his metallic gold contrasts with his black. Take those away and he's
a bit boring-looking, particularly in vehicle mode where he could really
use some more paint apps. I'd recommend Blackout slightly over this guy.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Grindor is a born soldier. He is both
a highly talented fighter, and an instinctive strategist. Every moment
of a battle is laid out in his head before the first shot is ever fired.
He is so talented at anticipating his enemy's moves that he is almost never
surprised. Whenever he can, he ensures himself a place at the direct center
of a fight so that he can bring his powerful weaponry to bear on the Autobots
around him, destroying as many as he can as quickly as possible.
