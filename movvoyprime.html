    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Target Exclusive Robovision
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Robovision
Optimus Prime

     Okay, so technically
this mold was designed first and THEN Robovision Prime's paint scheme was
decided afterwards, but Robovision Prime came out first, so hey, that's
the way my reviews work. The differences between Robovision Prime and the
mass-released version of Voyager class Optimus Prime are fairly minimal,
to where it you weren't comparing both side-by-side, you wouldn't notice
much of a difference. As a whole, this version of Optimus is duller and
more realistic in his color scheme-- the red and blue are both noticeably
darker than on his Robovision version. This version of Prime also has a
few extra details on his robot bits, such as some extra blue detailing
on his lower chest and upper legs that Robovision Prime lacks. On the other
hand, Voyager class Prime does not had silver paint covering up nearly
all of his grey parts like Robovision Prime does, and Robovision Prime
also has a few extra flame paint apps in his vehicle mode, as well as a
black matte paint app covering the rear section of his that mode.

     No mold changes have

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The mainline release
is SLIGHTLY less impressive of a toy than Robovision Prime, in my opinion,
primarily because he doesn't have that spiffy silver paint all over his
grey parts. Which one I'd recommend more depends on what kind of a look
you'd prefer from this toy; if you want a bright, more vibrant and metallic-looking
Prime, then spring for Robovision Prime. But if you want a duller, more
realistic-looking Prime, than this bot's the Prime for you.

       Optimus Prime is defined by his optimistic
outlook and the care he feels for his comrades and those they protect.
Though he may seem grim when contemplating the battle ahead, he looks always
ahead to victory, refusing to contemplate the slightest chance of defeat.
This attitude informs all that he does, and infects the other Autobots
as well, leading them all to approach each fight with absolute confidence
in their ability to win. It is, in turn, this that proves to be their advantage
in each and every engagement against the Decepticons, for in the face of
superior numbers and fearsome weaponry, the Autobots never back down, never
bend, and never break.

        As the Autobots race to hide the AllSpark,
the Decepticons close in. Bonecrusher catches up to the Autobot convoy
on the freeway near Mission City, ruthlessly tearing through civilian traffic
in an effort to reach the AllSpark before the Autobots can stop him. Sick
of the carnage, Optimus Prime takes it on himself to stop the hulking Decepticon
once and for all. He falls back, converts to robot mode, and dives into
battle with his energy sword ready.

         *In addition to the normal release, Voyager Prime was also released
in a Target Exclusive "Freeway Brawl" 2-pack with
         <a href="movbonecrusher.html">
          deluxe
Bonecrusher
         </a>
         . There were some slight changes to the paint deco, such
as changing the light gray to more of a tannish color, but it was mostly
still the same.
