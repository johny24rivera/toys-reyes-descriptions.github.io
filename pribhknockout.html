    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" deluxe Knock Out figure. For a review on the mold itself,

     Knock Out's another re-use
of the 2012 Robots in Disguise mold, with extensive beast-like remolding
as is typical of the Beast Hunters Autobots and Decepticons. Also like
most Beast Hunters remolds, most of the remolded parts are more obvious
in vehicle mode-- he's got armored, scaly-looking ridges and the like molded
into the sides of his car mode, with the front remolded quite ingeniously
to look like a mouth, with the gold "teeth" at the bottom and top in front
of the grill. It looks quite lovely, as do all the ridges along the back
end of Knock Out's car mode, ending in a stubby "crocodile tail" which
clamps onto the rear end quite securely. (You can plug the tail onto the
top of the car mode if you don't want it hanging off the back end.) This
tail section becomes a weapon in robot mode, with the handle separated
from the rest of the claw (which is spring-loaded, clamping shut unless
you pry it open) by a plastic chain. It's easy to see Knock Out using this
weapon like a grappling hook or just rather short-range weapon to crush
Autobots. Having little red-painted eyes on the main body of the weapon
to make it look like an exaggerated gator head is also a really nice little
touch. Some of Knock Out's robot parts have also been remolded-- namely,
his lower legs, his head, and waist piece. All three parts-- though functionally
the same as on the original deluxe Knock Out-- have more layered, armor-like
details, giving Knock Out a slightly more regal appearance that helps him
fit in with the Beast Hunters Predacons a bit more stylistically. The more
swept back arcs on the sides of his head and his central head crest look
particularly good-- I love this new headsculpt, which has an expression
that's a bit more grumpy than on the original Knock Out toy, like he's
sick of all these darned dragons everywhere. The "central" part of the
car hood, windows, roof, and the rest of his parts of his robot mode are
unchanged from their original release.

     Knock Out's color scheme
on the "core" parts that haven't been changed from the last release of
this mold also keep Knock Out's traditional colors of dull dark red, light
red, and light milky gray (with too much of his robot mode still that super-boring
milky gray, unfortunately). His clear plastic is a bit more tinted, but
otherwise the same shade. The big color changes have to do with his remolded
vehicle mode parts, with a lizard-esque green making up most of the color
scheme in said mode. The dark green is mixed in with a lighter shade of
the same color, both of them complementing and contrasting against each
other quite well and helping Knock Out look a lot more like "Croc Out",
along with the gold teeth around the silver grill and pale yellow headlights
that look a bit like "eyes" in his vehicle mode. I wish his main green
color was just a touch lighter to contast better with the dark dull red
used for the center of the vehicle mode, but generally it's a good color
scheme that accentuates Knock Out's unique "crocodile" theme to his upgrades
quite well. Since his robot mode has much more of the original toy visible,
there aren't nearly as many color changes, as I've already mentioned, but
the addition of a bit of gold on his waist and head (and some off-white
on his face) look great against the red, and the addition of dark red to
the light red kneecaps on his legs makes his leg colors pop a bit more,
as well.

     Beast Hunters Knock
Out is one of the most inventive remolds of an existing mold for the line--
I LOVE the unique crocodile theme that's been given to him, which is a
bit more distinct than the usual bird-like features given to many of the
other Beast Hunters remold upgrades. He has a great fun new weapon, and
his color scheme is considerably better than the original with the addition
of green and more accent colors like silver, gold, and generally more numerous
paint apps. Recommended over the original Prime deluxe Knock Out, no contest--
so long as you're not a stickler for realistic alt modes, that is. (That
said, I like the

     colors even more.)

        With Megatron missing, Predaking running
wild, and the other Predacons wreaking havoc all over the Earth, Knock
Out begins to think it might be high time to vacate the planet in favor
of somewhere less occupied by dragons. Lucky for him, Shockwave seems to
have the same idea. The Decepticon scientist comes to Knock Out looking
for his expert help in packing up what remains of the destroyed cloning
lab-- including the final two Hyperevolution Chambers. Knock Out isn't
entirely certain it's wise to be bringing cargo this dangerous with them--
but he doesn't really care as long as Shockwave pays for his help by getting
him off the planet.
