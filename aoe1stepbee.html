    Bumblebee's Camaro alt
mode is represented pretty faithfully for this one-step changer, with the
proportions pretty much spot-on to the actual Camaro in the movie. You
can JUST see the tiniest bit of his robot feet underneath the sides, but
other than that this mode is robot extra-free-- always a positive. The
usual colors are used for Bumblebee bere-- an orangish yellow and some
black for contrast. You probably know well by now whether you like the
colors or not. The addition of the silvery blue for the windows was a nice
decision, as it gives some much-needed diversity of color in this mode--
and thankfully, unlike on many TFs, his rear window is painted as well.
'Bee also has that nice stripe down the middle of his car mode, but other
than that this mode is lacking some paint. The front and rear bumpers are
wonderfully detailed, but they're both completely yellow-- not even some
red for the head/taillights. As such, despite even the painted windows,
this mode does look a little under-painted.

    Bumblebee is technically
a two-step changer; you press back on his windshield piece and slowly unfold
his vehicle mode into his robot mode accordion-style, though the hands
have to be rotated out manually to complete the transformation. Not a big
deal at all, but worth noting. As far as colors go, this is where Bumblebee
shines through a bit more, with considerably more black visible in this
mode-- not just the stripe on his stomach, but also the added black details
on his upper and lower legs, lower arms, and the black stripe down the
center of his head. His headsculpt is painted fairly well with some silver
on the face and some silvery blue eyes, but it looks "off" ever-so-slightly
for a reason I can't quite put my finger on. Maybe the face is just a tad
too small? Anyways, the mold detailing on the other parts of the robot
mode are pretty accurate too, with the expected details on his legs and
feet in particular pretty accurate to the movie, even if they are just
details. The colors and detailing are about all I can say that's positive
about this mode, though-- the proportions are absolutely horrid. Proportionally,
'Bee's head is far too small; his legs too skinny and actually looking
like a chunk was taken out of the upper sides; his chest too long; his
shoulders too narrow and two-dimensional; and his lower arms too wide and
two-dimensional, but in the opposite dimension as the shoulders/upper arms,
so there's always one part of the arms that looks too fat and one part
that looks too skinny no matter what angle you look at him from. From the
side Bumblebee's legs certainly gain more mass, but there's a noticeable
gap between the back of his robot mode and the shell of the top of his
vehicle mode, which is a bit unsightly. As expected from a one-step changer,
the articulation is also minimal, though that's not the point of this subline;
Bumblebee can move at the shoulders (at two points), rotation at the elbows,
and slightly inwards at the wrists-- which is actually pretty good for
a one-step changer.

    The "normal" one-step
changer Bumblebee toy has a pretty darned good (if a bit underpainted)
vehicle mode, but that all changes when you convert him to robot mode.
His proportions as a robot look utterly ridiculous, with pretty much no
part looking "normal". I understand getting a one-step transformation gimmick
involves some sacrifices, but this is too far. Only 'Bee completists should
get this one; if you want a simpler transforming Bumblebee toy for this
movie, go for either the Flip 'n Change version or one of the Wal-Mart
exclusive Legion versions instead.
