    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE 1-Step
Changer Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     The TLK (mass release)
1-step changer Optimus Toy follows very closely the color layout-- at least
when it comes to the plastic-- of the original AoE 1-step changer mold.
The milky dark blue plastic is in the same places, although a shade or
two lighter on this toy than on the AoE version. The moderately light brownish
gray is also in the same places, and the same shade, as far as I can see.
Same with the black plastic on the wheels. Some of the paint apps are the
same too, such as the blue on Optimus' eyes and the silver on his faceplate,
front grill and bumper, front of the roof, and on the smokestacks. The
red paint used for Optimus on this version, though, is decidedly duller
and darker on this version-- a negative, in my view. The flame pattern
used for this red on the front hood and sides of the vehicle mode is a
bit different on this version, with the flames a bit bulkier and shorter.
This is necessary, because, like the other mass release 1-step TLK Turbo
Changers, Optimus Prime has a "Cyberfire" gimmick where if you shine Mega
1-Step Changer Dragonstorm's "fire breath" light at his front hood (or
another UV light), some hidden paint apps appear. However, though they're
usually fire, since Optimus Prime already HAS flames on his front, it's
just a hidden Autobot symbol on the front hood for Prime here. Underwhelming.
The Autobot symbol on the transformation-activation button is smaller on
this version, and most obvious of all, the red paint used on the robot
mode is used MUCH less than on the AoE version-- just some small paint
apps on the sides of the blue portion of his chest, and that's it. Silver
paint is also missing from the legs on this version, making Optimus' robot
mode desperately needing more paint here. One final change made to this
version of Optimus compared to the original is that the blue paint used
for the front window (but not on the side windows, sadly) is a bit duller
than on the original-- again, a slight negative, in my opinion, as the
contrast isn't as good.

     No mold changes have
been made to TLK 1-Step Changer Optimus Prime.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The TLK version of 1-step
changer Prime shows what happens when you re-use the same mold multiple
years later, what with inflation and all-- you can't cut costs on the mold
itself, so the paint apps sadly decrease. The use of a much duller red
and blue doesn't help much, either. I'd get basically any other version
of this mold if you want one, as this one is the dullest of all the "regular
colors" Primes. That said, the Knight Armor Turbo Changer is a better choice
if you want a simplified toy of the TLK design, overall-- this mold in
general is pretty weak.
