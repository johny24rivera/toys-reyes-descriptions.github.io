    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original PotP Swoop.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original PotP Swoop

     The "Red" version of
Swoop isn't so much of a complete redeco as it is more of a variant if
you want him with a color scheme that more closely matches the other PotP
Dinobots, what with the red and all. And indeed, the most obvious change
for Red Swoop is that his body is... well, red instead of blue. The other
main, obvious difference is that the gold paint on the inside of the pterodactyl
head has been removed on this version; it's just clear plastic now (though
the Autobot symbol is still there, as well as the red paint on the beast
eyes and lower jaw). The black and gray plastic are all in the same places
as on the original PotP Swoop, though the gray is of a noticeably lighter
(and in my opinion less interesting) shade. The red paint apps are all
the same on this version, such as on the dino feet, sword, and lower robot
legs. The robot face is painted the same too, and there's the same metallic
light forest green on the wrists. It's very difficult to tell, but that
metallic light forest green might be just a SHADE lighter on this version--
it's so close, though, it could just be that it was applied more heavily
on my blue Swoop than on my Red Swoop. No, the only real differences in
paint apps are where this toy is most obviously different-- the robot chest.
This time around, Swoop has some metallic bronze details on his inner abs,
and the silver-painted "decal-like" paint apps on the sides of his upper
chest are a bit different and a little more expansive, mimicking slightly
larger stickers, but still with simplistic detailing like you'd expect
to find on a G1 toy.

     No mold changes have
been made to Red Swoop, but for some reason nearly all of his joints--
not just his ball joints-- are VERY loose, or at the least more loose than
on the original version. Like, mine couldn't even stand up under its own
power, the joints were so loose, and good luck getting him to hold up anything.
Get out the nail/floor polish for this one, you'll need it-- and this is
a universal problem, unfortunately.

     PotP Red Swoop is a
nice idea for an alternative to make the color scheme of PotP Volcanicus
more uniform, but I find the original to be better. The blue looks better
than the red in my opinion, but more importantly, the gray plastic on the
original is darker and looks better, and the joints can actually hold up
under their own weight without having to put several layers of nail/floor
polish on the toy to tighten them up. Only recommended if you're willing
to put in the effort to straighten up all those joints AND just really
want a more red, uniform Volcanicus.
