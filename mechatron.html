    Mechatron is the Beast
Rider for Megatron, and it reflects it pretty obviously. The Mechatron
Beast Rider is designed like a giant dragon head, with small claw "spark
extractors" on the sides. There is a double-barrel missile launcher coming
out of the mouth, and a wheel on each side. There is little difference
between the two modes, which are named "pursuit mode" and "battle mode".
"Pursuit mode" is the first picture shown above, in which the claws are
tucked behind Mechatron, and the top weapons are concealed. "Battle mode"
is the second picture shown, in which the claws are rotated out to the
front, and the top weapons are revealed. A claw behind the top weapons
is available in both modes to hold any Transformer riding Mechatron. The
gimmick is also active in this mode; if you press Mechatron's "head" down
and let it go, Mechatron will zoom over a flat surface for a while, his
claws in front rotating around. A rather neat feature, but I would have
prefered that the claws did an up-and-down movement to signify a "slashing
attack", rather than the claws just rotating around in place, which looks
rather odd. The claws also don't stay in any position when not activated,
so it's hard to get them to stay the way you want them to (face-up, so
to speak, instead of out to both sides and such). Since the two modes are
so similar, it rather defeats the purpose of transforming Mechatron, and
I usually just leave my Mechatron toys in "battle mode". Unlike
    <a href="che.html">

    </a>
    ,
which cannot hold the toy it was made for, Mechatron can easily have the
    <a href="bmmegatron.html">
     Beast Machines Megatron
    </a>
    held still on its
rear platform. This, needless to say, is pretty necessary for a Beast Rider
built for a specific toy. (Although why Megatron modeled his Beast Rider
after his dragon mode, which he hates, is beyond me.) The detailing on
this toy is also pretty good, and a bit better than Che's. The mechanical
tubing on the upper dragon jaw is really neat! The missile launcher can
fire its two missiles individually as well, which is a definite plus. The
original Mechatron (shown in each above pic on the left) has its color
scheme very similar to Beast Machines Megatron, which is rather neat. I
especially love the color scheme on the sides. The dark blue and black
go REALLY well together. The silvery-gray detailing pattern on the upper
sides could not look cooler, and is definitely a nice aesthetic detail.
The Mechatron repaint, however, is not done nearly as well. First off,
its color scheme does not represent Beast Machines Megatron at all, which
is rather odd. Second, the color scheme just doesn't go that well together,
period. Although the purple and black are nice, the tan and the rather
bright yellow just completely clash and throw the whole thing off. The
silvery-gray detailing on the original Mechatron has also been dulled down
into just dark gray detailing here, and it doesn't show that well over
the dark purple coloration (although it still looks rather neat).

    The original Mechatron
is a pretty neat toy visually, although its play value is limited because,
after all, it is only an accessory, and its transformation is a joke. The
Mechatron repaint has a bad color scheme, and still retains all the flaws
of his predecessor's design. Still, I think Mechatron is the better of
the two different Beast Riders, and I'd recommend him if you're into accessories.

      Megatron created the Beast Riders technology
to hunt down the remaining inhabitants on Cybertron and capture their sparks.
His personalized transport, Mechatron, is unstoppable and fashioned from
his sinister recycling projects. Though purely mechanical, Mechatron resembles
his master's dragon mode, due to a failed attempt by the despot to erase
the organic beast from his very being. This eerie battle chariot is programmed
to shred through or bombard anything that gets in its path. Twin "claw"
flame-throwers debilitate enemies from large distances, and its central
fusion cannon nullifies all resistance. Mechatron is outfitted with an
upgraded spark-capture claw that can tear out the entire laser core of
any Transformer defender.
