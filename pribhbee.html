not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots

     Beast Hunters Bumblebee
takes his cue from most of the Beast Hunters Autobots &amp; Decepticons,
and is an extensive remold of his original Prime "Robots in Disguise" mold.
And what a remold it is-- no longer rounded, Bumblebee now practically
bursts with black spiky "feathers" all over his form (particularly in vehicle
mode), and beyond the original two dual-barreled wrist cannons he comes
with, he also now comes with a nifty-looking "Eagleshot Bow", which is
an angular bow with a spring-loaded missile launcher. It has two missiles
that can be stored on it at once, though it can only fire one missile at
a time. In addition to the two missiles that are kept with the launcher,
there's FOUR additional projectiles on this toy-- two on each of Bumblebee's
car doors. What an impressive arsenal, particularly for a deluxe! The mold
detailing makes Bumblebee look a lot more "armored up" and deadly-- beyond
the aforementioned spike-feathers, he also has armor plating and angular
detailing all over his form, with the new details ranging from small spikes
to armor plating. Bumblebee's headsculpt has also been changed, with his
curvy head instead coming to a long point, the design and detailing making
him look a bit more bird-like. On a side note, Bumblebee's wheels are now
clip-on wheels and not pinned, but this doesn't really bother me given
all the other stuff 'Bee has gotten in place of those four pins.

     As for the color scheme,
Bumblebee's is largely the same as on his original Prime toys-- he's mostly
yellow with black and some light milky gray. The yellow is a bit more plainer
of a shade than on his earlier Prime toys, which I'm not fond of-- but
on the other hand, a fair amount of this yellow is mixed in with some dull
orange plastic in a plastic-coloring gimmick that comes to define many
of the Beast Hunters toys, and it gives more color variation without paint
apps while also just generally looking cool. The light milky gray-- while
still rather dull-- has a bit of a glittery tint to it, and thus doesn't
bug me quite as much as light milky gray plastic usually does. (It's almost
entirely confined to his robot mode bits, anyways.) A few accent colors--
like the dark blue windows, the gunmetal gray on his exposed engine and
a few other minor details, and the light blue on his eyes and headlights--
helps add a bit more color variety beyond the usual. I particularly like
the dark flat blue, as it provides a bit more "dark" to this toy without
being black, and contrasts excellently with the yellow. All this said,
particularly with the Eagleshot Bow removed, Bumblebee is really missing
some paint apps on the back end of his vehicle mode, where nifty molded-in
details like spikes are just begging for some paint. Same with his robot
mode parts, which are basically unpainted except for his face. With all
this plain yellow, a few more paint apps were definitely needed.

Bumblebee is an impressive remold with a TON of weaponry and some pretty
awesome details, such as all his extra spiky "feathers". However, the base
mold is still mediocre at best, and without a fundamental redesign there's
only so much you can do to make such an oddly-proportioned robot mode look
good. A bit more paint-- and a less primary shade of yellow-- also would
have been appreciated. If you're a Bumblebee completist or just love the
Beast Hunters vehicle aesthetic that much, this is a pick-up; otherwise,
I'd at least get the better-looking redecos of this mold, instead.

        With the thread of Predaking looming
over them all, every Autobot dedicates himself to discovering some means
of battling the Predacon overlord. But it is the scout Bumblebee who discovers
what may be the key to victory. Buried deep within data recovered alongside
one of the Iacon Relics he finds evidence of a derelict transport starship--
a courier packed with weapons more ancient than any relic yet recovered--
set adrift ages ago among the asteroids girdling Earth's solar system.
With no other way to reach the ancient ship, and not wanting to waste time,
he contacts Wheeljack, hoping the Autobot mercenary can provide transport
and-- if it turns out to be a trap-- an extra blaster.
