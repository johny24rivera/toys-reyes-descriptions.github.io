    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     Dirge is the only "official"
Classics Seeker repaint to not be completely accurate to his G1 self in
vehicle mode. His actual
     <a href="g1dirge.html">
      G1 jet mode
     </a>
     had slightly
different wings, but since he shares the same mold changes as
     <a href="clasramjet.html">
      Ramjet
     </a>
     ,
and Ramjet's wings are close enough to Dirge's, it's not a big issue for
me (particularly if you consider how impractical/costly it would have been
for the Botcon folks to remold TWO Seekers' wings). Dirge's blue is a bit
lighter than it was on his G1 toy-- probably to distinguish it more from
Thundercracker-- but otherwise the colors are spot-on G1, only with a bit
more variety in robot mode. All of the colors come together very well--
blue, black, and light brown make for a great color combo, and the silver
and red are used in just the right amount to break up the colors, and look
great against the black and blue as well. I especially like how detailed
his chest and waist are. The only complaint I have with Dirge when it comes
to his colors is that he has the dull slavish-G1 white/red stripes down
his wings, as opposed to the more dynamic stripes seen on the mass-released
Classics Seekers.

     Dirge is a great repaint
of a great remold, and with the exception of the dull wing stripes in vehicle
mode, I really don't have any complaints about him. My personal favorite
of the Botcon 2007 exclusives.

       Dirge always had a mean side, but with
his new lease on life his desire to end the lives of others has grown.
After all, now he knows for certain that there's nothing there when you
go offline. He thinks about it a lot, that nothingness. Every time he blasts
another living creature into atoms, it gives his turbine blades a little
thrill to imagine that life just blinking out and being gone forever.
