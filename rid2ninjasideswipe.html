    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 1-step Sideswipe

     "Ninja" Sideswipe follows
     <a href="rid21stepnobee.html">
      Night
Ops Bumblebee's
     </a>
     lead in essentially "reversing" his original colors.
To keep things from being TOO similar to Night Ops 'Bee, though, instead
of the main color being black it's a fairly light gray. Honestly black
would've worked better for a "Ninja", but the red does actually work as
a decent accent color against the gray. Of course, if you've been following
my reviews for long at all, you'll know that I'm not a fan of light milky
gray plastic, and this redeco certainly has quite a lot of it, particularly
in car mode. In car mode the wheels are a fairly dark, dull red, while
the red paint on his Japanese symbols near the rear and on the front hood
are painted, along with a bit of black paint on the front window. It looks
a bit plain, but honestly? Compared to the original version of this mold,
it's not bad, given how lean Hasbro's paint budget was on the previous
version. The red wheels also may not work on a realistic toy, but on a
RID2015 toy I actually like it. In robot mode the gray is broken up considerably
more, with light red paint on the arms, waist, and upper legs. The dull
red plastic is on the spikes behind his head and some small connector pieces,
while the blades coming out of his wrists are still a nice metallic bronze
shade. In general where there's a good amount of red it makes for an okay
scheme-- as long as the gray doesn't get too prevalent, as it is on the
lower legs and chest. Then things get a bit too dull. The final paint apps
for "Ninja" Sideswipe are light blue on the faux car headlights and eyes,
and white on his face. (Oddly there is no blue on the ACTUAL car headlights.)
I quite like how these accent colors work with the gray, and honestly I
wish the blue had been used a bit more as it really would've looked good
against the red and/or bronze.

     Despite Ninja Sideswipe
having noticeably more paint apps than the original version of this mold,
I think it's the worst color scheme this mold is in because of all that
boring light milky gray plastic. Granted, if you like/don't mind light
milky gray plastic, you may like this version more, as it IS a rather unique
scheme, and particularly in robot mode the addition of all the red paint
and some of the accent colors is well-done. But with all that gray, I just
can't like it that much.
