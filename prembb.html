    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe '08
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy

     Like most Premium toys,
Premium Bumblebee has a metallic sheen to his vehicle mode-- his yellow
has a pretty good-looking metallic tint to it. The black of the robot mode
has also been replaced with a dull gray, which is accurate according to
the movie stills, but not so much of the actual in-movie CGI model. Hrm.
Well, regardless, I don't think gray and yellow work together quite as
well as black and yellow, so I don't think Premium Bumblebee looks good
in robot mode as the original release, even with the "battle mask head"
that was also used on
     <a href="stealthbb.html">
      Stealth Bumblebee
     </a>
     . Additional
paint apps include the extra "outline" around his black stripes in vehicle
mode to make him more movie-accurate, but other than that the paint differences
are sadly minimal when compared to the original release.

     Beyond the battle mask
head used on Stealth Bumblebee, no mold changes have been made to Premium
Bumblebee.

     Premium Bumblebee is
a decent pickup for those who couldn't find the original release, as the
metallic yellow looks really nice in vehicle mode, but I don't like how
the gray looks in robot mode compared to the original's black. Add to this
the fact that his paint apps are barely different, and I can't really recommend
him anymore than the origianl release-- they're about tied overall, in
my opinion.

       Ever since the final battle against
the Decepticons, Bumblebee has been meticulous about his appearance. With
Sams help, he immediately buffs out every scratch he gets in his finish,
and he gets detailed once a month. Hes even convinced Autobot Ratchet
to learn a little bit more about cosmetic upgrades to Autobot systems,
so that he comes out of any post-battle repair looking just as good as
he did before.
