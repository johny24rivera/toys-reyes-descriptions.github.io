    Megatron's popular War
Within form is finally made into a toy! The thing is... in tank mode, at
least, it doesn't really look like War Within Megatron at all. The front
treads look pretty similar, and the colors are the same, but that's really
about it. In fact, it's obvious from even a casual glance that this is
a very, very poor alt mode-- it's waaay to obvious that it's just his robot
mode laying down with a few other minor changes. Geez, where do I start?
Okay, first off, the front treads don't sit at all flush with the rear
treads, which are faaar too back to really be functional if this vehicle
was real. It's far too obvious that the whole rear half of the tank is
just his robot legs. In fact, there's a peg that's supposed to hold the
two legs together as one piece on this mode, to at least make the leg-ness
of them a tad less obvious, but even that doesn't work-- the peg doesn't
hold together at all, so there's definitely a visible gap in between the
two halves of the rear portion of the tank mode. There also isn't really
any main turret whatsoever-- the red-and-black gun on the top can rotate
around, but it doesn't really sit on a turret. The main gun on the front,
which should actually be on a turret, instead just sits static on the front,
always facing forwards and slightly downwards. And when the main gun's
slanting downwards and it's already that low, Megatron better hope his
enemies are ants or he's cooked. Really, the front treads are the only
thing good about the mold in this mode. The colors are great, though--
black, red, and silver are certainly G1 Megatron's colors, and they all
fit together very nicely on this toy, not to mention they're great for
a tank as well. Megatron also has plenty of mechanical mold detailing and
a fair amount of paint detailing, too, but he could use some more paint
of the front portion of the tank mode.

    Megatron's robot mode
looks much, much better, though it better after that pitiful tank mode.
His proportions are pretty nice, with only two exceptions-- his head is
a bit on the small side (though it's an excellent sculpt), and the lower
arms are too small compared to the beefy upper arms. Those small quibbles
aside, though, it's a great robot mode. The asymmetrical chest design looks
especially cool, and I like how the main gun in tank mode becomes his famous
arm-gun here-- however, the peg that holds the gun to his arm is rather
loose, so the gun falls off far too easily. His large over-the-shoulder
gun is also boss, and he can hold it in his hand as well if you so desire.
The rest of his main tank gun "turret" becomes a shield that he can hold
in his other arm, though he can't really hold it like a shield due to the
peg placement. Megatron has pretty good articulation-- he can move at the
shoulders,
elbows, wrists, head, waist, hips (at three points), and knees. Unfortunately,
in an very annoying QA oversight, his joint pegs that rotate his lower
legs slightly below the hips are VERY rigid, and snap off if you don't
hold both parts of the upper leg very carefully when moving it. Also, the
tabs that hold his shoulders to his main body are a bit loose, though this
isn't as big of a problem as the aforementioned joint pegs. Megatron's
diecast parts, if you're wondering, are his main body and lower legs.

    War Within Megatron
is a big dissapointment for such a fan-favorite character, with an extremely
poor tank mode that looks very little like it did in the comics and a robot
mode that looks great, but has some annoying QA problems. One of the least-recommended
of the 6" Titaniums-- poor Megs, he just can't get a good toy in this line...

      For years he waited. For years he planned.
For years he sat in the shadows of the arena in Kaon watching as Transformers
fought and died. As the taste for destruction grew within those who fought,
he sowed seeds of his own rise to power, and the subjugation of Cybertron.
Those who proved themselves worthy through a talent for viciousness or
simple, raw power, he recruited. No more would they call themselves Transformers.
Now they are Decepticons.

      When the time came, his Decepticons
rose up all over the planet. In that first lightning strike, thousands
ceased functioning. So far, all of his planning has gone perfectly. Before
his assaults, the Autobots are helpless, capable of fighting only long
enough to barely manage a retreat to the next fallback position. All the
while, his plan progresses. The Autobots will be destroyed utterly, Megatron
thinks, the universe subjugated beneath my immortal heel, and the history
of my conquest read by the flickering flames of a thousand burning civilizations.
