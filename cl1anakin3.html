    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Class I Clone Pilot
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Class I Clone
Pilot toy

     Anakin Skywalker's venture
with the Class I Y-Wing mold doesn't look very different in vehicle mode
at a first glance, but upon comparison with the Class I Clone Pilot, it's
apparent that the yellow deco job is a bit different on this version, with
the sides colored with more of the yellow paint around, but with the shoulders/front
part of the vehicle boosters left unpainted in their stead (along with
a few other, more minor, variations in the yellow deco job). The yellow
is also a slightly brighter shade of the color, which I'm not as fond of,
but your mileage may vary on that. The black cockpit does continue to contrast
well against the otherwise bright color scheme of the vehicle mode, though
having the parts immediately around the cockpit painted yellow looks...
odd, for some reason I can't put my finger on. In mech mode, the skinny
part of the legs is also dark brown to simulate Anakin's "pants"-- but
even ignoring that, it helps to vary up the color scheme a bit and contrasts
excellently against all that white and yellow.

     Anakin has two mold
changes when compared to the Clone Pilot version of this mold-- the first
is that he's given a lightsaber accessory instead of a gun. It's less individualistic
than the Clone Pilot's blaster and still doesn't store in alt mode, but
it obviously works for the character. The second is a Clone Wars-styled
new head sculpt, which captures his likeness fairly well at this small
of a scale. Most of it looks adequately robotic, though I've never been
fond of the "hair" on SWTFs in all but a very few instances, and this isn't
one of them.

     Class I Y-wing Anakin
has better color variety than the Clone Pilot (in mech mode, more specifically),
but he's yet ANOTHER SWTF of Anakin, which is getting beyond old now considering
how many other characters there are in the Star Wars universe. Thus my
recommendation is to stick with the Clone Pilot version of this excellent
mold if you want one, but if more color variety is that important to you,
this might be the one to pick up instead.
