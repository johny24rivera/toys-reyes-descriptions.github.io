    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
Strongarm toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 1-step Strongarm

     The "Patrol" version
of Strongarm is in the more traditional colors of a police car-- by far
her dominant color is black, but there's also a fair amount of white on
her as well-- on the front bumper, small stripes on the sides, on the lower
legs, and on the upper arms. What's weird about it is that it's a metallic
shade of white, which is really odd as this color is almost never made
metallic. That said, it looks nice and is quite glittery, so it helps "spice
up" the scheme a bit against all that black. As far as accent colors, there's
some of the usual blue and red on her sirens, and some metallic blue on
her front window (but only her front window-- sadly the other windows are
unpainted). In robot mode, there's also a bit of metallic blue on her robot
chest to at least hint at her original color scheme. Though the helmet
is black because of the plastic breakup, otherwise her head is pretty show-accurate
with blue eyes, a silver face, and a yellow headcrest. All of these painted
colors look great against the black, but there needs to be more of them.
Particularly in vehicle mode, there's just too much black, particularly
on the front hood and on the back quarter or so of the toy. She really
needs some more of her mold detailing brought out.

     The 1-step version of
Patrol Strongarm-- overall-- has a better color scheme than the original,
as the original had a very oddly broken-up color scheme due to the way
the plastic colors were separated and just didn't look quite close enough
to Strongarm's actual color breakup. Even ignoring that, the predominantly
black scheme on Patrol Strongarm looks better overall, though with all
her plastic being black she really needs a few more paint apps. Oh, and
there's that whole issue with this just being an awful mold. Get the other
version of Patrol Strongarm instead if you want her in black.
