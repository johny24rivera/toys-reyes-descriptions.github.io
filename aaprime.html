    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RotF Leader Optimus Prime.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RotF Leader Optimus
Prime

     This redeco of RotF Leader
class Optimus Prime is more of a re-release with a few extra featuresl,
to be honest. All of the plastic colors on this version of Optimus Prime
are basically the same as those on the RotF. The only difference when it
comes to paint apps are the battle-damaged "blackened armor" paint apps
on his lower arms and chest. He's also got a few mold changes-- namely,
his face is molded so that it looks like his faceplate is retracted, and
his flip-out swords have been replaced with hooks. Given all these put
together, it's fairly clear this is meant to be the outnumbered Optimus
Prime in the "forest fight" scene in
     <i>
      Revenge of the Fallen.
     </i>
     Oddly,
there doesn't seem to be any battle damage on his vehicle mode at all,
whcih kind of makes for an incongrous appearance betwen his two modes.

     This is a fantastic
mold with a terrific (though very difficult) color scheme, and if you either
hadn't gotten a chance to purchase the original or like battle damage,
I'd highly recommend this figure. However, a new head, hooks, and a few
black paint apps on the robot mode aren't nearly enough to justify purchasing
him again for any by the most hardcore Prime completists. I'm not quite
a fan of the blackened paint apps and head without the faceplate, so I
think the initial release of this mold is SLIGHTLY better than this one.

       Optimus Prime is under no illusions
about how dangerous Starscream really is. The Decepticon second-in-command
might be a coward, but he's still smart and powerful enough to present
a real threat to Earth. The Autobot leader has human and Autobot agents
combing the globe for the hiding air warrior. As soon as they find him,
though, it will be Optimus Prime alone who goes in to bring him down.
