    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
sportscar. I have few problems with Rodimus Major's (better known as Hot
Rod's) alt mode, since it abides by the G1 normality of having no robot
parts visible and a good mesh of colors. The actual mold detailing could
use a bit of sprucing up, though- it's rather lackluster, even for a G1
toy. What I especially like about this toy is that the transparent windows
actually show real seats inside, instead of robot parts, like most of the
other TF vehicles with transparent windows do. A real nice touch, there.
His silver engine on the hood also has a peg in which you can insert one
of his guns, for some shootin' action in vehicle mode. (Too bad they're
both not storable in this mode, though.)

    Robot mode is average
for a Generation 1 toy- too stiff by today's standards, but decent for
back then. No major proportions problems or huge extras- although if you
do look at him from a side view, he's very...uh... hollow. The yellow fin
on the back really accentuates this mode, as does the fire deco on the
chest. The stickers on his upper legs tend to get scraped due to his transformatiojn,
though. His articulation is sparse, like most G1 toys- he can move his
arms at the shoulders, at the elbows in two places, and at the hands, but
he has no movement anywhere else. Go figure. The diecast metal bits are
his toes.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    A slightly above-average
Generation One toy- no huge positives, but no huge negatives, either (not
counting the articulation, of course). A rather nice car mode, and he's
actually *gasp!* reasonably priced, considering his limited production
run. Recommended for G1 fans.

      Rodimus Major is a typical adolescent
who dreams of being heroic and important. Although he means well, his impulsive
actions often get him into trouble. Carries two photon lasers that temporarily
electromagnetize an enemy robots microcircuits. An enthusiastic and idealistic
thrill-seeker who acts like the immature adolescent he is. Can be hot-headed,
but is a brave, admirable and honorable fighter. Major is an honorary
title bestowed on Autobots who exhibit great potential.
