a slight change of the shade of gray, Universe Nightbeat is the exact same

          I don't know what it
is about this mold, that we need TWO lazy repaints of it for the Universe
line just a few months apart. Anyways, the actual vehicle shell components
have a new color scheme-- the red-purple and black looks quite good together,
and Treadshot does have some new paint apps in his vehicle mode. They're
in a rather G2-style, though; you won't find too many Transformers nowadays
with their name emblazoned on their vehicle mode somewhere. I think that
was a little corny, myself. He has a racing stripe, but on one side of
his vehicle mode-- again, another oddity. I would have preferred a racing
stripe on the other sode of the vehicle mode rather than "TREADSHOT", myself.
"DECEPTICON" is also spelled out on the top of his front window, and a
large transparent Decepticon symbol is on his back window. Treadshot also
has a remold, just like his fellow mold exclusive
          <a href="oilwidow.html">
           Oil
Slick
          </a>
          -- he has a Decepticon symbol on his chest in robot mode now,
instead of an Autobot one. Unfortunately, also like Oil Slick, nothing
really has changed color-wise when it comes to Treadshot's robot parts--
they're the same as they were on Armada Sideswipe. And that orange yellow
really doesn't fit well with the red-brown, let me tell ya. The gray is
a slightly less milky color on Sideswipe, but it's something that you really
have to look for-- you won't notice it right off the bat. His other robot
mode paint apps are the same as on Sideswipe, too. Well, his robot mode
optics are a different color-- light blue-- but that's hardly anything.
Other than that, same color, same place, same everything-- it's deja vu
all over again. Bleh.

             Over-Run is VERY similar
to his predecessor Armada Over-Run-- the diff is only in the details. This
version has glossy red windows, like Armada Run-Over, and some of the smallest
plastic parts connecting the arms to the rest of the body are white instead
of blue. He also has the dark blue paint apps removed from his rear wings.
But that's really it-- very minor, minor differences which aren't even
worth the webspace needed to take pictures of them. Another boooring Minicon
repaint.

               Ultra Magnus is a very
nice repaint, especially for a Universe Exclusive, and is a great G1 nod
to boot.

               toy, but entirely
white with blue accents. Well, here's Ultra Magnus, a repaint of ARMADA
Optimus Prime, but mostly white with some accents. Normally, I'd expect
a white-and-gray repaint to be pretty dull, but Hasbro spiced it up quite
a bit with all the red, blue, and yellow paint apps on him-- they really
make him just great to look at. He really doesn't have a big-time secondary
color like his mold's predecessor, but that's the only think keeping him
from passing up Armada Deluxe prime, in my view. Well, mold-wise. It appears
that there's a rather serious assembly error when all these Universe Magnuses
were put together-- the lower arm pieces were put on backwards, restricting
elbow articulation unless you fix them. It's rather difficult to fix, but
if you have a moderate amount of skill, you can check out a fix on this
               <a href="http://www.capturedprey.com/Scripts/magnusfix.asp">
                web page
               </a>
               .
It's still pretty annoying, but luckily, it's pretty much the only downside
to this repaint.

                The Minicon repaints
in this set are very lackluster, and Treadshot's entire robot mode is pretty
much a carbon copy of his predecessor Armada Sideswipe's. Ultra Magnus
is the real star of this set, with a great, attractive color scheme that's
also a G1 homage. Unfortunately, there is that assembly problem... If you
don't have either of this set's previous molds, and you don't mind fixing
Magnus' assembly problem, then this set is mildly recommended at its $16
bargain price. Otherwise, pass.
