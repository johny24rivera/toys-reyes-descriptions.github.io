    Beast mode is an iguana.
Iguanus, by the way, was remolded from
    <a href="megacroc.html">
     Megatron
(Crocodile)
    </a>
    . This is one of several repaints that is, in my opinion,
better than the original. Some of his parts are remodeled, though, including
his robot and beast faces, and the frill on his beast neck. This mode is
nice-looking, although there is an odd yellow stripe down the middle of
his back. The detailing is pretty good, too. The articulation is pretty
much limited to only his mouth and front legs, though. His front legs have
the robot arms on the back of them, which looks very abnormal, and his
back legs are pretty small, and they cannot move by themselves. One of
the major downsides to this mode is not obvious just by looking at it,
or even after you first get the toy. After a while, the knobs that hold
the tail in place may wear, and, because the tail activates the spring
transformation, you may eventually have Iguanus permanently stuck in robot
mode. Thus, it is ideal to be gentle with this toy.

    Robot mode has some
extras- his iguana legs, folded behind his robot legs, and his frill, although
this doesnt get in the way much. The hardest part is getting his robot
gun (its his tail in beast mode) off. You have to literally pull it off
of the tail, and, after a while, the end of the tail wears a bit.

    A nice repaint, and
a pretty good basic toy overall. Recommended.

If Optimus Primal installs an infrared detection dish near a Predacon outpost,
Iguanus will alter it to self-destruct when fired. Body scales are actually
titanium-plated armor, as is the deflective headplate that shields him
from laser fire.
