    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Clocker. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Clocker

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Clocker's more realistic
deco for the movie line may be rather absurd considering his vehicle mode
is so obviously futuristic, but regardless, it's a nice color combo. The
metallic dark blue looks very, VERY nice and is a great color, but the
other colors complement it very nicely. Normally the dull gray and black
would look boring together, but something about combining them with the
silver and metallic dark blue really makes them feel appropriate, like
Clocker wouldn't feel "complete" without those two duller, more realistic
colors. The dull red used as accents not only contrasts nicely with its
surrounding colors, since it's the only "warm" color on Clocker while all
the other colors are "cool".

     No mold changes have
been made to Clocker-- a shame, since his Speed Planet Cyber Key really
doesn't make any sense in the movie-verse. Why couldn't he have gotten
a cool Sector 7 Cyber Key like

     ,
darnit!?

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Movie Clocker
is one of the best paint jobs this mold has had, right up there with
     <a href="unit2.html">
      Botcon
pre-BW Tigatron
     </a>
     in terms of awesomeness. Plus, he's a lot cheaper to
boot. Unless you already have Tigatron, get this version of Clocker if
you only get it once.

       Before the war for the AllSpark began,
Clocker was a professional racer on Cybertron. His speed and skill dazzled
millions of fans, and for a while, he seemed unbeatable. He was on top
of the world. Then war came, and there were suddenly no more races to run.
He turned his skills to finding the AllSpark, stopping the Decepticons,
and bringing peace to Cybertron. He dreams of the day the war ends, and
he can race again alongside his Autobot friends with no limits on how far
or fast he can go.
