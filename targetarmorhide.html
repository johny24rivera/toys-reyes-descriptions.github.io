    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Armorhide. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Armorhide

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Armorhide's repaint for
the Target Exclusive scout movie line is, as expected, duller and more
realistic than his Cybertron color scheme. Black and gray may not be the
most exciting colors in the world, but they're certainly realistic on a
truck, and Hasbro has made sure to throw in just enough real color to make
Armorhide look pretty cool this time around as well. The black is easily
the dominant color here, not the gray, so Armorhide doesn't look too much
like many of the actual Movie characters, for one. The use of silver on
the wheels and truck grill also adds some great contrast against the black,
and the usage of yellow here and there really helps out the colors a lot,
to keep Armorhide from looking too monochrome. In fact, I'd say the yellow
is what makes the color scheme-- without it, Armorhide would be really
dull-looking, but with it he looks sleek and cool.

     With the exception of
a pack-in "Sector 7" Cyber Key instead of his normal Earth Cyber Key, no
mold changes have been made to Movie Armorhide.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Movie Armorhide is one
of the better repaints to come out of the Target Exclusive scout assortment,
with realistic yet interesting colors (primarily due to the yellow, which
serves as a GREAT contrast color). Recommended over Cybertron Armorhide,
as I think the black &amp; yellow on this toy looks cooler than the blue
on the Cybertron version.

       Up against an enemy like Megatron and
his followers, the Autobots can't afford to be nice. To Armorhide, this
fight is about nothing other than total victory, and the only way he sees
to achieve that is to become as much like the Decepticons as possible.
He knows Optimus Prime doesn't approve of his methods and he doesn't care.
Once the Decepticons are wiped out the historians can argue as long as
they'd like about whether his way of fighting this war was right or not,
but at least they'll do it in peace and safety.
