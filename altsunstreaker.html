    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Sideswipe. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Sideswipe

     , is now
obviously the character the toy was meant to be in the first place, and
in the proper colors-- yellow and black were Sunstreaker's main colors
in G1, so it would make sense that they carry over to his Alternator form.
Yellow and black are also certainly realistic colors for a car, and the
stripes down the center look good, just as they did on Dead End. I'm not
nearly as fond with yellow as I am with Dead End's black-and-silver, however.
Sunstreaker is also the first Alternator to be a straight repaint without
at least some remolding done, and his colors are a strict pallet switch
from Dead End with no new paint apps-- a bit of a dissapointment, really,
considering how much effort was put into the previous Alternator redecoes.
I'm also not sure what the whole red/gray arms thing that's going on with
Sunstreaker's arms is all about-- Sunstreaker's arms in G1 were yellow
and black just like the rest of him, and they look almost identical in
their colors ot Alternator Dead End's as well, which is kind of a lazy
color choice, in my opinion.

     It's nice to see Alternator
Sunstreaker finally get done, but the color scheme is far inferior to Alternator
Dead End's, in my opinion, and it's a shame Sunstreaker didn't at least
get some remolding done. Unless you're an Alternator completist, I'd get
Dead End instead.
