    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Megatron (T-Rex). For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Megatron (T-Rex)

     Beast mode is a tyrannosaurus
rex. Although this guy has a rather lame name, he more than makes up for
it with his great color scheme. His red color scheme is perfect for a T-Rex,
and makes him look really cool. Don't get me wrong, Megatron (T-Rex)'s
color scheme was cool too, but a purple tyrannosaurus just reminded me
a little too much of Barney.

     In robot mode, T-Wrecks
keeps the same pros and cons of the original Megatron (T-Rex), with a few
exceptions. For one, the neon orange does NOT fit in with the other colors
at all, and makes me wonder what the guy who came up with it was thinking.
This is a complete repaint, with no mold variations whatsoever, not even
for a Dinobot spark crystal, which is kind of a let-down. Also, it doesn't
make much sense that a leader of the good guys has a face exactly like
MEGATRON, the main 'bot he's up against. I really wish they would have
remolded the face a little to make this fact a little less apparent. The
chest compartment seems to stick on the back plate a little firmer than
did the original Megatron (T-Rex), but this could just be my toy.

     A great toy, except
for the neon orange part of his color scheme. Recommended over the original
Megatron (T-Rex).

       As a strong defender of the Maximal
cause, this former attack specialist stationed in sector 17 of the Mirtonian
constellation has returned to Cybertron. Reformatted into the charismatic
Dinobot platoon commander, T-Wrecks, his fellow Maximals bestowed him the
nickname "Big Rex" as a testament to his powerhouse presence on the battlefield.
Serrated steel jaws can snap most materials in two, acidic breath instantly
corrodes most alloys and dual hip-mounted launchers fire air-imploding
projectiles.
