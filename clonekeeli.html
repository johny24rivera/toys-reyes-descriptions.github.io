    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Captain
Rex. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original SWTF

     Like many SWTFs, Clone
Captain Keeli's main colors remain a light bluish gray and white, even
though it's a redeco of a toy that was also primarily those colors. They
do tend to be the standard colors of Star Wars vehicles, after all. However,
there are a few pretty noticeable differences on Keeli here when compared
to Rex, the most obvious being the forest green adorning most of his AT-TE
mode. This particular shade of green is VERY striking, and gives a lot
of visual pop to the alt mode that Rex didn't quite have. Unfortunately,
it isn't nearly as prevalent in mech mode, but the intricate paint details
on the mask look REALLY cool, and appear to take their cues from a cheetah
or perhaps tiger. The half gray/half dull red paint apps on the chest also
look pretty neat, and the other bits of dull red and black on Keeli's mech
mode help to break up the colors some from all that gray and white-- though
it's not nearly as successful as the vehicle mode's green.

     Clone Captain Keeli
has a really nice, attractive shade of green adorning his AT-TE mode, and
some really cool paint apps on his head (and to a lesser extent, his chest)--
plus, the mold itself is above-average for Star Wars Transformer. Mildly
recommended if you like this and don't have the AT-TE version of Captain
Rex (I'd recommend this version slightly over Rex)-- but if you already
have the mold, Keeli isn't really different enough for a purchase from
all but the most hardcore collectors.
