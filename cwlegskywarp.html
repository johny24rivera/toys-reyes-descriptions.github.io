    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Legends

     This is a G1-inspired
Skywarp redeco; you pretty much know what you're getting by now if you're
familiar enough with Transformers to be reading this review. His main color
is black, with a fair amount of purple and silver, with the latter being
more prevalent in robot mode. He also has the standard nice metallic bronze
paint on the cockpit, which contrasts extremely well with the black. Thus,
my main comments are on how this Skywarp redecos differs from the "norm"
when it comes to Skywarp redecos. For this version, the purple is a bit
darker than normal; in general I'm not as big a fan of this compared to
a lighter purple, as it means that it doesn't contrast with the black as
much. Again, it still looks GOOD, just not AS good, in my opinion. Additionally,
the stripes in vehicle mode are wider than normal, which I like, as it
helps keep that mode less black-focused. The white stripe also looks pretty
good against these thicker purple wing stripes.

     No mold changes have
been made to Skywarp, though like

     , he unfortunately doesn't come with a little
Targetmaster partner. On the upside, since Skywarp's vehicle mode is mostly
black the hole in the middle of it for said partner isn't as obvious, so
it doesn't feel as much like something's missing.

     Since you learned about
the existence of this toy, you probably already have decided whether you
want it or not, and I'm here to inform you that there aren't any real surprises
or QA issues big enough that will likely change anyone's mind from their
initial decision. In my opinion, Skywarp has the best color scheme of all
the Seekers and this version doesn't change that, so I'd recommend it the
most out of all the Generations legends Seekers. However, usually people
don't want just 1 Seeker and focus on the whole set, so there's that, as
well.
