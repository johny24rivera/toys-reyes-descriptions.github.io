    Only available if you
buy a specific cake at Wal-Mart (that's blue with flame frosting-- pretty
cool, actually), this cake topper Prime's vehicle mode is surprisingly
good. The proportions are pretty spot-on for the most part, though the
front nose of the truck should be a bit longer proportionally and the main
body of the truck a tad shorter. The mold detailing, though adequate, is
a bit lax in this mode, but Prime has quite a bit of paint detailing--
his flame decals really look great. The gray paint can be a bit sloppy,
though. There's no robot extras visible in this mode, either, which is
nice. The main thing that bothers me about this toy is the coloration--
the blue, gray, and black are fine and work well together, but why is the
red so light it's practically pinkish? It just looks off when compared
to Prime's other colors.

    Prime's robot mode doesn't
look nearly as good as his vehicle mode, but hey, it's a cake topper, what
do you want? The mold and paint detailing on his robot face and chest are
very well done, even if his main body is just detailing on a square block,
really. His legs are too short, with the upper legs being see-through due
to the sliding-out nature of that part of the transformation. He's also
got a rather noticeable big piece of vehicle kibble right behind his head,
made up of the front bumper. I normally wouldn't have a problem with his
arms-- they're a tad skinny, but that's only because they're next to Prime's
big blocky body-- but the wheels fold out of the way very nicely, and they've
overall got good proportions and detailing. The shoulder ball joints are
very loose, however, making it difficult for Prime to raise his arms. (In
case you're wondering, Prime's other points of articulation include his
head and waist-- not a very posable piece, but again, it's a cake topper,
you can't really expect that much.) His feet are also rather small and
make him a bit unstable as far as being able to stand up by himself.

    The cake topper version
of Movie Prime isn't nearly the best version of the character as far as
the toys go, but it's surprisingly good for a cake topper and made of fairly
good-quality materials. Unless you're a Prime completist, I'd recommend
skipping this one, though if you know a young Transformers fan who has
a birthday coming up, he'd make a great accent to the perfect cake.
