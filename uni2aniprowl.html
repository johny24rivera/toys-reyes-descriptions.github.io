    It's rather odd that
they took one of the most unusual transformations among the core Animated
characters and gave him a Legends-class toy, of all things. Regardless,
Prowl's unusual design, at such a small scale, definitely means a lot of
sacrifices in vehicle mode. The two wheels are about the only thing about
this mode that says "motorcycle". Beyond the mold detailing, this version
of Animated Prowl doesn't look very "Animated", simply of all the sacrifices
that have to be made at this scale-- his proportions are more weird than
stylized and smooth. His robot mode arms are the biggest thing-- they clearly
stick out of the top of the motorcycle, His wheels also look rather odd,
looking overly "rigid" for some reason I can't quite figure out, and the
nose/windshield of the motorcycle doesn't stick out of the main body--
another huge proportion problem. You can also see the top of Prowl's head
sticking out from his shoulders in this mode, and there's no motorcycle
to speak of. Plus, he has no kickstand, so it's incredibly hard to get
him to stand on his two wheels in this mode. Still, on the plus side, his
black/tan/gray/gold color scheme is replicated here very well, and he has
enough paint apps for a toy of this size.

    Prowl's robot mode fares
considerably better than his vehicle mode, due to most of the design effort
likely going into making this mode look more show-accurate. It pulls it
off surprisingly well for a Legends toy, all things considered-- he still
has the wheels in the lower legs, the motorcycle panels behind his shoulders,
etc. Unfortunately, like most of the other Animated Legends toys, due to
the design constraints he has an odd mix of Animated and more "traditional"
proportions. His face is really well-molded and painted, and is a perfect
representation of his Animated self, as are his chest, waist, and lower
arms. However, his legs and arms are a bit overly blocky and stiff-looking
to look like they belong to an Animated character. His wheels also stick
out rather oddly from his lower legs instead of meshing into their surrounding
parts seamlessly like on the
    <a href="aniprowl.html">
     mainline deluxe toy
    </a>
    .
His feet are asymmetrical because of the transformation, and the pegs that
hold the wheel on his right foot and his waist together are rather loose
and come undone way too easily. As far as articulation goes, Prowl, can
move at up-and-down at the neck, as well as at the shoulders, hips, and
knees. His shoulder movement is extremely restricted due to the hinges,
however-- he can only move them up and down in a "jumping jack" motion.

Animated Prowl is one Legends toy I'd definitely stay away from unless
you're a particularly huge fan of the character. His transformation is
simply too unusual for a toy of this small size, and both modes suffer
form it. His motorcycle mode barely looks like a motorcycle at all, and
although his robot mode looks considerably better, it still has its fair
share of problems like odd shoulders and wheels sticking out uncomfortably
from his lower legs.
