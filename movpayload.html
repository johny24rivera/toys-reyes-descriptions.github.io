    Payload, based off of
a drone from the main console version of the
    <a href="tfmovieps2.html">
     Transformers
Movie video game
    </a>
    , has the alternate mode of a armored transport truck,
like the kind you see transporting money to banks. This alternate mode
is very convincing, with spot-on perfect proportions and absolutely no
robot mode extras to speak of. The color scheme of dark blue and light
gray isn't exactly exciting, but it certainly doesn't clash and looks quite
realistic, which is sort of the point of the movie toyline. The "Armored
Security Services" logos on the sides and the stripes down the front hood
of this mode help to liven things up a little. Payload's myriad panels
that comprise the main body of his vehicle mode to present a bit of a problem,
though, as they intersect at several different angles and are rather obvious,
making the main body look less "solid" than it otherwise would appear.
This is particularly annoying around the aforementioned "Armored Security
Services" logos, as the lines in between the pieces bisect the logo into
not just two, but THREE parts, which is rather distracting. Another, much
more minor, annoyance with this mode is that the front grill tends to pop
off pretty easily. He's also pretty small for a deluxe, even taking into
account that he's pretty compact in this mode.

    Payload's robot mode
has the typical "Decepticon robot drone" face, which consists of a singular
optic and little else. I rather like this drone style, and Payload is no
exception. I also really like his skeletal fingers, they definitely make
him look more evil. Overall, this mode is pretty good, though with a few
downsides. For one, parts of the sides of his vehicle mode sit on his shoulders,
and are rather unapologetically kibble. Plus, they don't really lock into
a space, so they tend to wobble around a bit as you play with Payload.
The piece that forms his upper chest and head pops off extremely easily--
the pegs that hold it to the lower chest are entirely too shallow-- and
this can get rather annoying, needless to say. Payload's gimmick is EXTREMELY
cool-- push forward on the pole extending from behind his body, and a HUGE
(proportionally) capture claw will extend forward out of his stomach, ready
to crush and/or suck the life out of unlucky Autobots! The downside to
this gimmick is that this pole extends way, WAY behind Payload's actual
back-- about twice the width of his actual body, to be more precise. It
can lead to him getting a bit off-balance, it's so bad. His legs could
stand to be a tad longer, but otherwise Payload's proportions are spot-on,
and he's got pretty good articulation, too-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows, wrists, waist, hips, knees, and ankles. I like
the addition of the metallic teal to the color scheme in this mode, it
really helps Payload look more visually interesting. Plus, as you'd expect
from a Movie toy, his robot parts are exquisitely detailed mold-wise, with
gears and panels of metal everywhere.

    Payload has a somewhat
dull, though well-proportioned, vehicle mode, and an excellent robot mode
with a few minor kibble problems. Given his unique look and really awesome
gimmick, though, I'd mildly recommend him to any Transfan looking for a
fun $10 figure.

      Two things are crucial to maintaining
the Decepticon cause and the hunt for the AllSpark - energy and currency.
Energy powers weapons and combat systems, and money allows the Decepticons
to purchase modifications and integrate them into their bodies. Payload
is tasked with seeing that Decepticon forces in need of either commodity
get it on time and in full. He's armored and armed to plow through or destroy
any Autobots that get in his way, and fast enough to outrun almost anything
on the road.
