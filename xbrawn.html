    Vehicle mode is a SUV
(sports utility vehicle). This mode is very nice, and, if it wasn't for
the small cracks and crevices in the vehicle, it would be of model quality.
The detailing is very good, and you can pick out door handles, headlights,
etc. There's even a "spare tire rack" molded on the back, and guard rails
under the sides! The wheels are also made of rubber, which is always a
good "quality" sign. The silver is a very accurate color scheme for an
SUV, and the blue-green fade toward the back looks good, too. A nice, hidden
feature is available in this mode, too- life up the front hood, and you'll
see a nicely-detailed, chrome silver "engine" under it! Very nice! The
only major problem I have with this mode is that the X-Brawn robot parts
are pretty visible under the transparent plastic windows in this mode.
It kind of detracts from the overall "robot in disguise" look in this mode.
It could have been easily eliminated by giving X-Brawn tinted or painted
windows, too...

    Although X-Brawn's robot
mode isn't quite as good as the vehicle mode, it's still pretty nice-looking.
Even if the proportions are a bit odd (the main body is unusually small),
it definitely gives this 'bot a lot of personality in this mode. My favorite
of X-Brawn's unusual quirks is that his left arm is HUGE, consisting of
the entire front of the fan mode, while his right arm is puny in comparison,
definitely giving X-Brawn a "strong-arm" look to him. His legs are also
rather odd-looking- the upper legs are normal-sized, but the lower legs
are, again, huge. This would be okay, if it wasn't for the fact that they're
largely hollow from the back, and that detracts from the overall look a
bit. The feet are also very odd-looking as well, since they're made up
of the halves on the spare tire rack from the vehicle mode. X-Brawn's detailing
is excellent in this mode, in both ways. Mold-wise, there is tons of robotic
detailing on every part that can only be seen in this mode, and there are
tons of wires, buttons, and mechanical detailing everywhere. Paint-wise,
this mode is nice in detailing, too- especially the chest, which has, besides
the nice colors of black, blue-green, and silver, some lime-green coloration,
which is used nowhere else on X-Brawn. The robot face is also nicely detailed,
with transmetal gold eyes, a small "forehead laser-optic" on one side of
the head above one eye, and a nice "gas mask"-like face. There is also
a chrome red Autobot symbol on the underside of X-Brawn's left arm; a nice
touch. The only major problem I have with this mode is that the car doors,
attached to the side of the left arm, get in the way quite a bit, and they
don't really move out of the way at all or "appear" to be something, so
they are very blatantly extras. Not to mention that, since they're long
and thin, they're relatively easily breakable. X-Brawn's van hood on the
back is also a blatant extra, but at least it doesn't get in the way much.
X-Brawn has two "weapons" in this mode, made from his side guards from
the vehicle mode. He has a sword and a laser-gun, either of which can plug
into his right fist and be fired (although why X-Brawn would want to fire
his own gun off is beyond me). The thing is, because the missile-pieces
are so large compared to other missiles, the spring-action is rather weak,
and the sword or laser gun don't fire very far. X-Brawn's two projectiles
can be stored either on his van-hood on his back (a nice touch), or one
can be stored in a small peg on the side of his upper right arm. It comes
off a bit too easily in that position, though. X-Brawn can also carry his
detachable front bumper (which detachs a bit too easily, I might add) in
his left hand, but it doesn't really look like a weapon at all, so I jut
leave the bumper attached to the front of the van, myself.

    A very nice transformer
in vehicle mode, and a pretty good one in robot mode, too, with a lot of
personality. He has a few rather blatant extras in robot mode, however,
which is the only thing keeping him from getting into my "Must Buy" category
(9.0 or above).

      X-Brawn loves extremes and is at his
best in disastrous situations and brutal climates, such as dry deserts
or snowstorms. He doesnt waste time on long-winded speeches and can be
counted on to say it all in just a few words. Hes very reliable and has
fearsome strength. He is a martial arts master with an especially powerful
left arm. His "Southpaw Lariat" is invincible.
