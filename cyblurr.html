    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Armada Blurr. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Armada Blurr

     Cybertron Blurr is, appropriately
enough, a homage to G1 Blurr-- the toy's robot head has been remolded into
an almost exact replica of the G1 version's. It's got loads of paint detailing,
and looks very nice. I do think that it's just a tad too large compared
to the body, but that's a small quibble. Blurr's vehicle mode has also
been remolded pretty significantly, with lots more futuristic detailing
on the back end, such as exhaust pipes, intake fans, and other super-cool
details that also have some pretty good paint apps, too. Armada Blurr's
Minicon gimmick-- wherein you would insert his Minicon, Incinerator, into
his vehicle mode to unlock a "flight mode" by having the sides flip down--
has been remolded on Cybertron Blurr to be activated by inserted a Cyber
Key in the same place. It also stays in after it activates the gimmick,
which is appreciated. The missile launchers have also been remolded so
that they don't require a Minicon to be plugged into them in order to fire--
now they just have regular trigger buttons. (The missiles themselves have
also been remolded to be a bit bulkier and more stylized.) In addition,
the missile launchers also have been remolded so that Blurr doesn't hold
them in those circular slots on his lower arms anymore, he holds them in
his actual hands. On the one hand, this looks better. On the other hand,
Blurr does not have a very good grip on the launchers anymore, and they
tend to fall out of his hands a bit too easily. As for Blurr's color scheme,
it's relatively G1-accurate, with only a few minor changes. It's pretty
good, but I do wish Blurr had another main color besides just two different
shades of blue-- all the other colors are secondary or accent colors. The
red and white do fit in pretty well with the blue, however. The transparent
black... not so much. I understand wanting to keep with the whole "Speed
Planet cars have transparent tires" thing, but this carries over into a
transparent waist piece, feet, and upper legs in robot mode, and that doesn't
look so hot.

     Cybertron Blurr is one
of the more extensive Armada remolds in the Cybertron line, and overall,
he's a very nice remold, with lots of cool extra detailings and some nice
design differences like making the missile launchers hand-held. I think
his color scheme could use a tad more variation, and I don't like the transparent
black parts, but overall I think he comes out a tiny bit ahead of Armada
Blurr. Recommended-- probably the best-done Armada remold of the four done
for Cybertron.

       A former race champion, Blurr retired
years ago and has since made a career coaching younger speedesters in the
subtleties of racing. He is a tough teacher, with a gruff personality that
often comes across as bad-tempered to those who don't know him. Long-time
students of his know, however, that his demanding temperament hides a gentle
Spark. He is tough on those who come to him for training because the takes
their successes and failures personally, and he requires no less of his
students - and himself - than their best.
