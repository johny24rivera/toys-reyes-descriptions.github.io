    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron

     Although he's named Menasor,
likely for copyright purposes, this toy is actually likely an homage to
Motormaster, a G1 Stunticon Decepticon who transformed into a black truck
and merged with his teammates to form Menasor, which is likely why that
name was used instead since they weren't able to get the Motormaster name.
The overall color scheme is defnitely reminiscent of Motormaster, that's
for sure, what with the gray and black being by far the primary colors
used on the figure. By themselves, however, black and gray would certainly
be a very dull color scheme, so a bit of light purple as added to the mix.
If the purple were a primary color, it would look rather gaudy, but given
that it's only used in a few spots on such a small figure, it really contrasts
nicely with the black and gray and makes the figure look much better than
it otherwise would have. The purple is also a very Decepticon-y color as
well, so it certainly fits. A little more light purple could have been
used on the legs or waist, however, as those areas of the figure still
look rather dull. I'm also not fond of the ghost-white face, it just doesn't
look good.

     Classics Menasor is
a great homage to Motormaster, and the addition of purple to the black-and-gray
color scheme really makes the figure look much more pleasing to the eye
than it otherwise would have, though it still could have used a little
more of that purple to help the colors contrast more on the lower half
of the figure. Recommended slightly over the previous paint jobs this toy
has had.
