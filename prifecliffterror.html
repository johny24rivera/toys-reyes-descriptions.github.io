    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime First
Edition Cliffjumper. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Alas, poor Prime Cliffjumper,
we hardly knew ye. Yes, the guy got less than an episode before being offed
and then was subsequently revived as a Dark Energon zombie, only to get
offed for good a short while later. Still, it makes for an interesting
repaint idea! Cliffjumper's base colors and silver/black paint apps are
pretty much exactly the same on this version as on the original First Edition
Cliffjumper toy, but now he's got a few silver-edged purple "damage" paint
apps along the roof of his car mode. They look pretty darned cool, and
help to break up all the red of his vehicle mode a bit more. His transparent
plastic has also been changed to a dark purple, which contrasts with the
purple surprisingly well, and of course fits his "Dark Energon" theme pretty
nicely, too.

     Cliffjumper's head has
been remolded for this release, and is exquisitely detailed, with one of
his horns missing, a crazed, undead expression in his optics, and damage
around his drooling mouth. It's a very nice sculpt and fits the purpose
of this toy perfectly.

     Terrorcon Cliffjumper
is a pretty neat idea for a "themed" zombie redeco, though with so much
of him the same as the original First Edition Cliffjumper, if you have
the original this one isn't really worth picking up (and particularly not
the more expensive "Rust in Peace" version-- see below). That said, if
you DON'T have the original First Edition of this mold, I think the couple
extra paint apps help to break up the colors better than on the original,
and the head sculpt makes this toy a bit more unique. (This applies to
the "Rust in Peace" version moreso, but that version's also more expensive.)

       His frame shattered and his spark destroyed,
the once proud Autobot warrior Cliffjumper lay broken on the floor of a
Decepticon base, doomed to rust and ruin. But then, with diabolical cruelty,
Megatron devised a fate worse than deactivation for the brave Autobot.
Plunging a shard of Dark Energon deep into his wrecked body, the Decepticon
leader returned Cliffjumper to an agonizing semblance of life, turning
the brave soldier into a mindless monster bent only on destruction.

       *This toy was also released as a San Diego Comic-Con 2012 exclusive,
called "Rust in Peace" Cliffjumper. The core toy is essentially the same,
except with a few more "damage" paint apps--particularly on the windshield,
sides of the vehicle mode, and upper legs. In addition, it comes with a
two transparent purple accessories; a shard of Dark Energon he can hold,
and an "energy burst" plastic piece that fits into his chest to recreate
the shard of the stuff that brought him back to life. It also comes in
a container shaped like the toy's zombified head inside another box with
his chest details. Although the additional paint apps and accessories are
kinda cool, this is also a release that's $10 more and, if you have the
Toys "R" Us version of Terrorcon Cliffjumper, really isn't worth getting.
