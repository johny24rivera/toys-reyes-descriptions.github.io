    Tow-Line's vehicle mode
is a tow truck. This guy definitely catches one's eye, but not in a GOOD
way. He's one of the few RiD toys that has an extremely loud color scheme.
I don't know about you, but I have to see a bright green-and-orange tow
truck cruising down the street. Other than his very odd color scheme, Tow-Line
doesn't look half bad in this mode. However, his robot hands are very obviously
stored on the back of the tow truck, which kind of ruins the whole "Robots
in Disguise" thing going on. From a directly side-view, you can see his
robot head as well, but it's no big deal. Be mindful of the chrome on the
wheels, however- it tends to come off easily.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    In robot mode, Tow-Line's
color scheme stays the same (unfortunately). His chest is a bit large proportionally,
but it's not nearly as bad as, say,
    <a href="skidz.html">
     Skid-Z's
    </a>
    .
His head has a hard time peeking over the very top ridge of the truck front,
but it's hardly noticeable from any angle except a head-on one. Tow-Line's
face is very nicely done, and very neat-looking. The "light-piping" effect
works very well on this toy as well. Tow-Line has standard articulation-
his head can move, as well as his knees, upper legs, elbows, and shoulders
(at two places). Tow-Line's gun's storage is rather creative- it stored
on the underside of the truck grill in vehicle mode- but in robot mode,
it basically looks like his gun has a grill sticking out the back end of
it (which it does). It looks very odd.

   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    With the exception of
Tow-Line's atrocious color scheme and a few other, more minor, setbacks,
he's not that bad of a toy. It's a safe bet you can find a better one,
however.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Tow-Line learned the rules of the road
while pretending to be an ordinary tow truck, before Megatron's invasion.
He believes in following the rules to maintain a tight force and still
uses traffic codes to keep things in order. His strong hook can lift and
transport anything large or small. He can also knock down opponents with
a mysterious, unseen force.
