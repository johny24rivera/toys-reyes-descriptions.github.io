    Boba Fett's vehicle mode,
the very appropriate Slave-1 vehicle mode, is pretty much perfect, all
things considered. There are NO robot mode extras whatsoever in this mode,
even if you look at it from the rear-- quite an accomplishment. Everything
looks fairly solid as well, though the pieces that comprise the top part
of the "dome" on the rear of the vehicle mode do tend to snap off a bit
easily, and the "shoulder pieces" connected to the wings are a little loose
on mine. The mold detailing is very good, as is the paint detailing-- I
especially love the "worn" dull red paint apps. The miniature Boba Fett
figure looks pretty good for how small he is, and fits fairly well in the
cockpit (though he has to stand, not sit). The lower guns can pivot on
their axes, and a missile launcher is housed in the rear of this mode,
though you have to flip it up from its set place if you want to fire it
at something. All in all, one of the best SWTF vehicle modes, and that's
saying a lot.

    Boba Fett's robot mode
would be fairly good if it wasn't for the legs. The back part of the Slave-1
vehicle mode tucks away rather nicely so it doesn't get in the way of movement,
his arms look pretty good, and his main body isn't TOO bad, at least from
a front view-- from a side view, however, Boba Fett looks rather fat. The
Mech face also is an exact replica of the actual Boba Fett's, and I'm not
too fond of that-- I prefer these toys to have their own moderate changes
to their faces so that it doesn't look like the ship transforms into the
actual character. The gun on the backside of the mode flips up so that
it can fire out of Fett's upper back, just like in vehicle mode, but I
really would've preferred if it could come off and Boba could hold it in
one of his hands. What IS cool, though, is that the little guns on the
front of the vehicle mode come off and Boba can hold them as little mini-pistols
in this mode. They don't peg into the fists quite as securely as I'd like,
however. Boba also has pretty good articulation-- he can move at pretty
much any major point except the waist, and there also isn't any point at
the knees to rotate his lower legs. The look of the legs, though, is my
huge beef with Boba-- they just look absolutely silly, and because of that
they make the entire robot mode look silly. They're too short proportionally,
too skinny from a front angle, and too fat from a side angle. The hips
also need to widen a bit, as Boba's legs are definitely too close together.
It was just an incredibly bad design decision, to make the legs look as
they do.

    Boba Fett has a flawless
vehicle mode, but his legs and fat body make his robot mode look absolutely
ridiculous. Definitely one of the worst Star Wars TFs; not recommended.

      A bounty hunter never stops for rest,
especially while hunting his prize catch. Boba Fett, the galaxy's most
notorious bounty hunter, has been tracking Han Solo for months. Using modified
armor and new shape-shifting technology, Fett morphs into Slave I mode
and flies to Coruscant, where Solo was last spotted.
