    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Leader Jetfire.

     I'm pretty sure you know
the drill by now; Thundercracker is a redeco on Starscream in dark blue,
silv-- wait,
     <i>
      what?
     </i>
     Thundercracker is a remold of
     <i>
      Jetfire
     </i>
     and came out
     <i>
      before
     </i>
     Starscream? Well, that's a first. Anyways, as
far as coloration goes, this version of Thundercracker is very much by-the-book
when it comes to matching the general coloration of his recent toys. Dark
blue and black dominate his color scheme, with some dyanmic red-and-silver
stripes on his wings in vehicle mode (with the tailfins black) while his
chest and waist in robot mode have a good amount of silver on them as well.
The jet cockpit is also a transparent light yellowish-orange, as it's traditionally
been. The one thing here that's "out of the normal" in terms of Thundercracker's
color scheme is that the plastic used for most of his gray parts is a really
nice, semi-metallic shade of the color-- one that I really wish was used
on many, many more TFs, as it actually kinda looks like metal. There is
a touch of that blah light milky gray plastic too, but it's used for small
little connector parts, like the hips and the missile for his gun. Because
of the transformation, Thundercracker does have a weakness in robot mode
that most of his other toys of recent don't though, and that's that there's
just too much unpainted dark blue in his robot mode. This is because only
the UNDERSIDE of the wings are visible in this mode, and they're unpainted.
They really should've offset this with some sort of paint apps up there,
or compressed Thundercracker's wings more in robot mode so he didn't have
so much dark blue visible around his head and shoulders.

     The more interesting
thing about Thundercracker this time around than his color scheme is the
remolding done when compared to Jetfire. The robot chest is different,
now a more close approximation of the traditional Seeker "cockpit chest",
though his is entirely fake (and the fake cockpit is painted orange as
opposed to the transparent orange on the actual one). There's also a new
headsculpt, as you'd expect, which nails the G1 seeker look pretty well
but with a bigger "helmet" and smaller vents than are traditionally used
on G1-esque Seeker heads. He's also got a rather neutral expression on
his face, rather than the usual Starscream smirk that comes with usually
being a repaint of ol' Screamer. The headsculpt works pretty nicely, overall,
though the new chest does look a bit overly/obviously fake. The main wings
have also been changed, to be more swept back than Jetfire's (and they
can't rotate back-and-forth like Jetfire's either-- they're fixed). The
large top engines from Jetfire have also been completely removed (though
the clips that connect them on the top of the jet mode are still there),
and they've been "replaced" with two blaster accessories for Thundercracker's
forearms, to fit in with the traditional Seeker look. All that said, in
general it's not a good tradeoff between Jetfire and Thundercracker-- Thundercracker's
hollow blaster accessories are nowhere near the same size and mass as Jetfire's
big dual engine piece, and the new headsculpt doesn't have a cool slip-over
helmet like Jetfire did-- not to mention there's no chrome on Thundercracker
(though some may certainly see the latter as a positive).

Thundercracker is a pretty decent redeco, with some inventive remolding
done and some pretty nice color choices made, even if they are pretty much
by-the-book colors for Thundercracker by this point. The remolding done
is largely nice, but leaves Thundercracker with considerably less mass
than Jetfire, but at the same price-- and Leaders were already starting
to feel a bit light for the pricepoint. Add in a robot mode that has large
unpainted swaths of dark blue plastic, and although he's an okay toy by
himself, he's largely unneeded, given

       Thundercracker lives on fear. Special
materials in his jet frame allow him to unleash controlled sonic detonations
that can be heard 200 miles away. Streaking across the sky at Mach 6, he
wants his enemies to hear him before they see him. He wants them to know
he's coming, and cower in fear at their impending doom.
