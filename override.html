    Override, leader of the
Speed Planet, has a vehicle mode of a futuristic race car. First off, the
things I like about it-- for one thing, this mode is pretty steamlined,
especially in the front, so it's easy to see how she could be the fastest
thing on Speed Planet. The diagonal headlights on the front make her look
even sleeker than she would otherwise be, for some reason I can't quite
put my finger on. The wheels also look really cool, as they're transparent
red plastic with dark-colored "tread" detailing spaced around the wheel.
Looks almost like some kind of hard candy, heh. The drivers' seats molded
inside the transparent cockpit is a nice touch, too, though the windshield
can't be raised up or removed or anything to look at the seats more closely.
However, the mold detailing on most of the rest of Override is comparatively
sparse when compared to other Transformer toys, even considering she's
a sleek race car. It makes her look more simplistic than she would otherwise
be. The paint detailing is fair, though I wish the red was a couple of
shades darker-- the color scheme is okay as it is, but it would've looked
better by giving Override another dark color to offset the white more.
There are also a couple of robot extras that are blatantly obvious-- the
robot head, for one, which sticks out over halfway above the top behind
the cockpit. It doesn't mesh at all with the surrounding parts as well,
so it looks especially awkward. It's also way too obvious that her feet
make up the front sides of the vehicle, what with the upper robot legs
not even trying to be hidden in the middle section (and not blending in
witht he surrounding parts at all), while the curved nature to the front
sides and the headlights scream out "FEEET!" to anyone who has even minimal
experience with how Transformers are designed.

    A note about Override's
transformation is that it's partially automatic-- just press down on the
small "fin" on the front center of the vehicle mode, and her upper body
transforms in one flip-- however, you do have to transform the legs and
waist yourself. This automatic transformation also means you have to hold
several parts together when transforming her back to vehicle mode until
the whole assembly clicks in place.

    Override's robot mode
has a few good points about it, but it suffers from some serious proportion
problems. For one thing, it doesn't look a THING like a female-- which
explains why the toy is male in Japan. The chest is very wide without having
much depth-- suitable for a male TF, but hardly for a female. The head
seems dwarfed in comparison. The arms are also laughably small, being suited
more for a basic-sized toy than a deluxe. The legs look rather female,
but that's about it on Override. The head sculpt is nice (though not really
female)-- I like the sweeping head antennae, it makes her look sleeker.
I'm not too fond of the orange face, however. One of the most annoying
downsides about this mode, however, is that the part of the race car that
hooks onto her back does not hook securely at ALL-- it comes undone incredibly
easily, and consdering that this makes Override's head/chest assembly jiggle
up and down a bit, it's also incredibly annoying. There's also nothing
keeping the shoulders in one place, so when you're moving the figure around
a little, the arms constantly turn in and out where they connect with the
main body, due to the fact they flip around to become wheels in vehicle
mode. It's also rather annoying. On the plus side, however, her articulation
is decent-- she can move at the head, shoulders (at three points), elbows,
hips (at two points), and knees. She could use some sideways knee articulation,
but that's the only thing that really interferes with her posing much.
Her feet, because of other projections near the heel, also don't keep her
as stable as you'd think they would, which limits articulation a little
as well. As for her Cyber Key Gimmick, if you insert her gold (because
she's a leader) Speed Planet Key into the backside of the removable rear
panel fo the vehicle mode, too little guns flip out. It's not exactly spectacular,
and the guns on mine have a tendency to curve inward slightly because of
the springs involved, but it's serviceable. What IS annoying about it,
though, is that with the key inserted, Override can't bend at the elbow
on that arm because it gets in the way. Bleh.

    Override isn't all bad,
but she's got some significant problems in both modes, especially when
it comes to proportions, stability issues, and she also has some pretty
noticeable robot extras in her alt mode. She's one of the worst deluxes
in the Cybertron line, surpassed so far in badness only by

Not recommended unless you're a completist.

      Long-time champion and leader of the
Speed Planet, Override is always ready for a race. Acceleration is her
only ideal, but she respects anyone with the guts to challenge her. She's
faced and beaten thousands of upstart speedsters in her time. Though at
first suspicious of the intentions Hot Shot and the Autobots have for her
world's Cyber Planet Key, Override is only too glad to help once she realizes
what's at stake.
