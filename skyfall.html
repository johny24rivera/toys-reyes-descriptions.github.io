    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Sky Shadow. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Sky Shadow

     Skyfall is the first
part of a combiner that will take five years (!) to complete, with one
part being the club exclusive for each year up 'till 2009. Given the change
in management at the beginning of 2005, the Collectors' Club people have
admitted that Skyfall was a bit of a rush job to get him out on time to
the club members. As such, although the other combiner parts will be remolded
somewhat, this one isn't. However, the color designers did make Skyfall
unique enough to easily distinguish him from his two Energon mold buddies,
Sky Shadow and
     <a href="enterradive.html">
      Terradive
     </a>
     . He's almost ENTIRELY
transparent-- it looks really cool, as not only does he almost glow near
any reasonably bright light source, but you can see some of the internal
robot parts through the plastic in plane mode. Also because of this, the
robot hands are more easily seen in robot mode-- however, the flipside
of that is they're also more visible in plane mode. The transparent red
Energon weapon and chip also looks great next to the transparent dark blue.
However, Skyfall does have some major downsides, as well, that partially
overshadow the transparent Transformer. For one, the light red clashes
a bit with the blue-- if it were more of a darker red, it would have been
fine, but alas, it isn't. Also-- and this one's a biggie-- Skyfall has
VERY few paint apps. Just a few small black paint apps surrounding his
cockpit window, on the tip of the nosecone and the rear turbines, and on
the robot face. (Well, and the Autobot symbols, but those don't really
count...) So it makes Skyfall look very plain in terms of this, almost
prototype-ish. In addition, his head paint app is very sloppily applied
on many of the toys-- including mine, where the stripes on the forehead
are noticeably off. I don't know if the cost of making the toy transparent
forced them to get rid of many of the paint apps, but I wish a bit more
variety in the color of the paint apps could have been used, if nothing
else.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Skyfall's transparent
plastic was a good idea, as was most of his color scheme, but the clashy
light red and severe lack of paint apps make him a bit inferior to Sky
Shadow and Terradive, I think. Still, it is certainly a unique piece, and
it's not at all a bad toy. If you're a serious collector, I recommend him--
otherwise, don't bother with the club membership price needed to get this
toy.

       Dogged for as long as he can remember
by the sense that he had lost something vitally important - that he's supposed
to be part of something great - Skyfall has spent most of the last few
thousand vorns charting and exploring barren star systems.

       All too aware of his difference from
the other natives of Speed, he has chosen the life of a lone explorer,
piloting his ship the Flash Frenzy to deep space destinations. He's certain
he's one of the oldest Transformers on Speed, and yet he continues to function
without the quirks or stalls the other old-timers seem to develop. Now
he has embarked on his latest solo mission to a long forgotten planet called
Cybertron where he hopes the solution to the riddle of his past will be
found.

       In battle Skyfall wields a formidable
30mm cannon, double-barreled lasers and his impressive ability to shape
Energon into a plasma pulse weapon. When under extreme duress, Skyfall
can generate an apparently impenetrable force field made of an unidentified
form of energy. He is largely unable to control this ability, but it has
saved his life on more than one occasion.
