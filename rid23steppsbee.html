    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Hasbro never seemed to
tire of coming out with variants of this mold, as this is the
     <i>
      sixth
     </i>
     different release of the same general design-- and it's back to the original
mold, so no changes like the
     <a href="rid23stepbee17.html">
      "Activator"
     </a>
     remold from earlier in 2017. This time it's "Power Surge" Bumblebee, though
that's not to be confused with the more
     <a href="rid2powerbee.html">
      expensive,
electronic, simplfied
     </a>
     version of Bumblebee from 2016. Power Surge Bumblebee,
instead, takes MOST of his cures from the
     <a href="rid23stepebbee.html">
      Energon
Boost redeco
     </a>
     , in terms of the general color layout. As far as the actual
plastic and paint colors go, the only difference is that the yellow used
for Power Surge 'Bee is more of a moderately dull, milky shade, compared
to the more "pure" shade of Energon Boost 'Bee-- though it's the same shade
of yellow plastic used for other Bumblebee toys in the Combiner Force subline.
I like the "pure" shade a little better, but it's still a minor difference.
The main difference between Power Surge and Energon Boost Bumblebee is
that for this version, there's some really cool "Energon blue" circuitry
patterns on several parts of his body (the middle and sides of the chest,
the lower arms, and a bit on the front hood/lower legs). And it really
helps make the toy-- I mean, I like the blue-on-yellow scheme already,
but these nifty cartoonish circuitry designs really push it even further.
Instead of electric blue being used on the outside of the "three vent"
details on the front hood/lower legs, though, it's used on the vents themselves
for Power Surge Bumblebee, with some circuitry paint apps running off and
black around those blue paint apps. The blue stripes on the vehicle hood
are also slightly different on this version, with the main stripes not
as wide as on the Energon Boost version, but with small additional blue
lines right next to the main stripes this time around. There's also black
on the faux car chest, and the thin separations between the car windows
are not painted over on this version. Otherwise, the plastic colors and
breakup are the same as on the Energon Boost version-- silver abs and head;
light blue and red headlights; black waist, wheels, and upper arms; etc.
That said, although he definitely has more paint apps overall, Power Surge
'Bee does have ONE paint app removed, and that's on his eyebrows-- they're
no longer painted black, but left silver like the rest of his face.

     No mold changes have
been made to Power Surge Bumblebee compared to most of the previous versions
of this mold, though he doesn't have the "head looking downwards" problem
some of the earliest releases of this mold had.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The 3-step version of
RID2015 Power Surge Bumblebee (wow, that's a lot of qualifiers) is the
best version of this mold that still keeps the basic yellow Bumblebee colors.
The blue goes very nicely with the yellow already, but adding in all those
excellent circuitry apps on so many places-- and not sacrificing almost
any other paint apps compared to the Energon Boost version-- is a huge
plus. Recommended, especially for the 3-step target audience.
