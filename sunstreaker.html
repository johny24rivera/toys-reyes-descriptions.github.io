    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RiD Prowl. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of RiD Prowl
    <a href="ridprowl.html">

    .)

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     This time around, the
RiD Prowl gets redone as an old G1 character- Sunstreaker. The vehicle
mode, while not exact, is a pretty close representation of Sunstreaker's
old G1 vehicle mode, colors and everything. Well, except for the boosters.
Like his Exclusive brother
     <a href="bcsideswipe.html">
      Sideswipe
     </a>
     , Sunstreaker
has a mold change made to him from the original RiD Prowl mold- the sirens
are gone, with a yellow sticker in its place. (There's a sticker there
instead of yellow paint because the white plastic on this toy isn't made
to hold onto paint very well.) While this does make him more accurate to
his G1 counterpart, this DOES mean that the boosters can no longer be held
onto his sirens, or on his back in robot mode as a jet pack. If you ask
me, it really wasn't worth the trouble, since you now HAVE to have his
jet boosters in only one place in each mode or you have to put them aside.
Meh.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Sunstreaker color-wise
is pretty nice- normally I'm against yellow being used in such large amounts
on a toy, but it looks nice here, for some reason- the shiny gold especially.
Plenty of paint detailing and varying colors in robot mode, but in vehicle
mode, Sunstreaker looks, well... boring. Just a yellow top and a black
bottom, with a gunmetal gray panel near the rear. Oh, the headlights and
such are painted as well, but they're so little it doesn't help the fact
that he's basically just two colors. A bit more paint detailing in the
vehicle mode would have been appreciated.

     Sunstreaker is a nice
repaint, but I'm not too fond of the removal of the police sirens, and
the vehicle mode is a bit boring- in fact, those are the same problems
I have with his Exclusive brother Sideswipe. Still, if you're willing to
look past those faults (and his expensive price), he's a worthy addition
to a collection.

       The complete egotist, Sunstreaker thinks
he is the most beautiful masterpiece of Cybertronian design ever built.
Loves his sleek styling, slightly contemptuous of his fellow Autobot race
cars (particularly his twin Sideswipe). His vanity is matched by a fiercely
competitive nature and relentless drive to prove himself the best in the
battlefield. In robot mode, the double barreled multi-purpose launcher
mounted on his right arm fire dual laser-guided missiles. Launcher also
doubles as a melee weapon which can create twin fiery sabers. Shoulder
mounted electron-pulse weapons ports are capable of emitting sustained
bursts of high-energy electron pulses at 300 bursts/sec.

       (NOTE: In addition to being a OTFCC 2003 Exclusive, Sunstreaker was
also only available if you reserved a room in the hotel where the convention
was at- in other words, he's almost doubly as rare as his other exclusive
brethren.)
