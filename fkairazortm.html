    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Airazor Transmetal. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Airazor Transmetal

     The Fox Kids Repaint
of Airazor Transmetal gives the bird-bot a similar color scheme as the
original, only a couple of shades darker. The only major color changes
are that the light red is changed to dull yellow, some of the creamy cyan
to light brown, and the transmetal silver takes on a bluish tone. Although
this color scheme makes it easy to imagine this toy as a "dark clone" of
Airazor Transmetal, it is not quite as fitting a color scheme for a majestic
falcon as the original, brighter color combo was. Thus, because of this,
I recommend the original Airazor Transmetal over this repaint, but obviously,
if this is the only one you can find, get it, because it's still a pretty
good toy. No apparent mold changes were made to this repaint, so it retains
all the flaws and features of its predecessor.

       A quantum surge has completely rearranged
Airazor's structure to include a metal-armor coating and a pontoon plane
substructure that provides the added advantage of sea reconnaissance. Already
quick as lightning, her twin jets furnish extra high-level acceleration
and agility. Her optical matrix scanners can detect Predacon ground movement
from 30,000 feet while her armor-ripping talons send fearful sparks through
the Predacon army.

       (NOTE: This repaint also retains the lame "shield" mode of Airazor Transmetal;
however, since the shield and robot modes are so similar, I decided to
not include a picture of it here. If you wish to view Airazor's "shield
mode", please go to the original review of Airazor Transmetal.)
