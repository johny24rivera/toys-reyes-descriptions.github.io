    Jazz's Pontiac Solstice
vehicle mode is fairly good for a Legends class toy, for the most part.
The proportions are pretty close to perfect, and everything fits together
solidly-- no real obvious lines along his form or anything. He suffers
from the same dull gray color scheme that the other Movie Jazz toys tend
to have which would have been solved with silver paint, but if that wasn't
an option on the larger figures it certainly wouldn't be on a $4 toy. He
really needs paint on his headlights, but otherwise his paint apps are
adequate for this mode, with all the necessaries like tailights and windows
being painted. (And the dark windows look nice against the light gray,
I must say.) I do have a big problem with this mode, though, and that's
the INCREDIBLY obvious fake car front near the rear end of the car. It's
like Jazz has two front bumpers in this mode, but with one inexplicably
on his roof. It's really weird-looking. Another, much less distracting,
robot mode extra is the little "spikes" on the front corners of this mode,
which form the heels in robot mode. Those definitely aren't there on an
actual Pontiac Solstice, that's for sure.

    Jazz's robot mode is
a bit better than his vehicle mode, since it doesn't have such an oddity
like a second car front here, though he still does suffer from a few design
flaws. The first is that, during transformation, his little rear spoiler
piece can come off rather easily, though it's a simple matter to put it
back on. There's also a rather noticeable unsightly gap in between his
head and chest panel. The biggest flaw in this mode is one that isn't there
for any apparent reason design-wise-- there is no "locking' mechanism for
the torso when it folds down during the transformation. Thus, keeping Jazz's
torso straight in this mode isn't as easy as it should be-- wiggle him
a bit too much, and he'll either lean forwards or lean backwards enough
where his lower torso piece bulges out from below his chest. (On the other
hand, though, this does give him an additional "point of articulation"--
he can look up or down at the waist, even if his head can't move.) Jazz's
other points of articulation are back-and-forth at the shoulders, ball
joint movement at the hips, and side-to-side movement and the knees-- pretty
typical for a Legends class figure. His lower legs and arms have rather
obvious pieces of vehicle kibble on them-- the arms are essentially just
engraved on the inside of his door pieces-- but this is pretty typical
for a figure this small, so it's more easily forgiven, and the extra kibble
doesn't really get in the way of movement so I don't really mind it much.
Jazz's mold detailing is excellent in this mode, especially on his head
and chest, and his paint detailing isn't too bad either, though it could
be better on his legs.

    Legends class Jazz is
a bit above average for a figure of his size, though he does still have
a few obvious flaws like his second fake car front in vehicle mode and
his lack of a locking mechanism for his torso in robot mode. If you're
particularly fond of Jazz's character and like small figures, by all means
get it-- otherwise, get one of the larger Jazz toys instead.
