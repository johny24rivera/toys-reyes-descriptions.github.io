    Daytonus' vehicle mode
is a race car, and a very neat one, at that. Although a perfect rectangle
in shape from a top-down view, Daytonus still manages to look very curved
and sleek in this mode. The paint apps are also nicely done- the black
and silver strips really add a lot to this mode. In fact, with the bluish-silver
round windshield, this race car looks very futuristic, even though it's
based on an actual race car model (its exact name escapes me at the moment).
There are no extras whatsoever in this mode- even the robot feet on the
back are designed to look like vents. Like the other Wave 2 Spychangers,
Daytonus' gun is storable on the bottom of his vehicle mode, which is a
definite plus, as you don't have to get an extra container for it. No complaints
on the vehicle mode here.

    The robot mode, however,
is another story. Like the other Wave 1 and 2 Spychangers, Daytonus' robot
mode is not nearly as sleek as his robot mode, and is not very appealing
to the eye at all. His front chest is actually wider than his back, and
very odd-looking. Although at least he's the only Spychanger who can reach
past his chest with his arms- just barely, but he still can. Like the other
Spychangers, Daytonus can only move his arms at the shoulders articulation-wise,
and that's it. This severely limits his playability, as you can only do
so many poses with your arms the only movable parts of your body... Oh,
and the tailfin from the race car mode looks rather odd hanging off his
feet, too, although at least it keeps him stable.

    Although he has a pretty
neat vehicle mode, Daytonus' robot mode is just like all the other Wave
1 and 2 Spychangers- blocky, odd, and unappealing. Buy him for the vehicle
mode, not the robot mode.
