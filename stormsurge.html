    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Shortround. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Shortround

     S7 apparently has power
on the sea as well, since Storm Surge here is a hovercraft with Sector
7 logos on its sides. The color scheme shares a really nice mix of "realistic"
colors and having an aquatic theme. The black and gray colors by themselves
would look pretty dull, but having such a nice contrast with the lighter
white makes Storm Surge look considerably more interesting. Dark blue makes
a great other major color as well, and is probably my favorite color shade
on this toy. The "Allspark Power" electric light blue accents-- primarily
on the robot chest-- look great against the surrounding colors, as well.
To offset all the cool colors, though, Storm Surge has some nice reddish
orange accents on his turbines, gun, and torpedo tips, which also serve
as great contrasting colors, yet still retain a bit of a "naval rescue
vehicle" tone in their particular shade.

     Honestly, I have no
complaints with Storm Surge's color scheme whatsoever. The mold is purely
mediocre, but the colors chosen for Storm Surge match his vehicle mode
perfectly, he's got tons of paint apps (except for on his arms, which are
rather bare), and everything contrasts wonderfully. He outshines Cybertron
Shortround in every way in terms of his colors.

       Storm Surge is so named because of his
all-encompassing approach to combat. Allies and opponents alike rarely
leave a fight in which he is involved without being soaked in corrosive
salt acid, or bathed in jellied gasoline. During fights at sea, the water
around him erupts constantly into geysers as his depth charges roll indiscriminately
into the ocean. On land, he sprays the area around him with emitters housed
on his arms, figuring that the more destructive power he puts out, the
more likely it is heÂ’ll take out his Autobot enemies.
