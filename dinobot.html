    Beast mode is a velociraptor.
Looks very nice, but his robot legs are clearly visible from his upper
chest and his beast legs are sort of oddly placed at the sides of his middle.
However, he does look fierce, and the color scheme is very nice.

    Robot mode is very nice,
with few extras. His tail opens up to reveal a spinning shield and a sword.
His feet bend to form his hands, which look odd, but nice. His feet have
a bone image imprinted on them in some places, and his chest is his dino
head. His only extras are his dino butt on his back and his small dino
arms on his sides. He has a mutant face and a face you see on the TV show,
although his mutant face can come apart easily. I really wish Hasbro wouldn't
have put in the mutant face, though, because it gets in the way a lot,
and it can't come apart all the way.

      As if torn from the pages of earth's
prehistoric past, a vicious velociraptor breathes again! But Dinobot is
no ordinary 'raptor, he's a robot in disguise battling beside his heroic
teammates, the Maximals! Armed with a spinning cyber-slash tail weapon
and always hungry for battle, Optimus Primal considers him a natural combat
