    Grimlock's t-rex mode
is fairly well-done-- compared to the show his body could be a bit chunkier,
but given the transformation this wouldn't be possible without an inaccurate
robot mode, so... lesser of two evils, I suppose. (The bottom of Grimlock's
stomach in this mode forms the chest of the robot mode.) There's BASICALLY
no robot mode extras in this mode, though if you look straight-on from
the front you can see Grimlock's robot face in front of the underside of
the tail. However, from annny other angle you can't see it, and given that
you usually see toys this small from above, this is a very minor extra
at best. The mold detailing is fairly good and show-accurate for the most
part, with the appropriate divots, lines, and the like everywhere they're
required, though the t-rex head detaliing is a bit mushy, probably because
it has to split in two even at this small scale for the transformation,
so something's got to give, I guess. Grimlock's got his usual main color
scheme of black and green, with a couple of colors of his head-- silver
for the upper lip and teeth, light silvery blue for the eyes, and a dull
gold-brown for the head crest. It's definitely less metallic or bronze-ish
than the head crest on most of the other RID Grimlock toys, which is a
little unfortunate if you ask me. There's some black paint on the hips
and dino feet, but the t-rex arms are unfortunately left all-black, which
is a bit of an oversight even at this small scale. As far as articulation--
in this mode Grimlock can move back-and-forth at the shoulders and hips.
Unfortunately no knee articulation, which can make some of his t-rex poses
a little awkward.

    Grimlock's transformation
is pretty cool, yet still adequately simple for the Legion class size.
Obviously the dino legs become the arms, and the dino tail simply folds
behind the upper back, but the entire main body slides down on a rotating
hinge to reveal the upper legs while those sections themselves becomes
the lower legs. It's one motion but still quite cool. The end result is
a surprisingly strong Grimlock for such a tiny size, given his usual look.
The only real issue here is that the tail does stick out pretty obviously
behind Grimlock's upper back, but the chest is very well-sculpted, the
arms are nice, solid, and beefy like Grimlock's should be, and the legs
are generally solid, though the downside of the awesome transformation
is that the t-rex arms hang off the sides of the lower legs. The green
and black is broken up fairly well on Grimlock in this mode as well, though
a few black paint apps on his hands or some green paint apps on his lower
legs would've helped a bit more. The green on the chest is done pretty
well, though, and the headsculpt has the same dull goldish brown from the
t-rex head crest on the faceplate and light metallic silvery blue on the
eyes. Unlike most of his toys, however, this version of Grimlock has a
more "G1-ish" sculpt, with a faceplate and a visor instead of separate
eyes and a mouth. For articulation, Grimlock can move at his shoulders
and hips-- also, due to the transformation, the lower legs can angle inwards
and outwards a bit to make his feet flush with the ground.

    RID2015 legion Grimlock
is a pretty good design of the character in both modes, with only some
minor extras and missing paint apps being remotely noteworthy issues. Plus,
his transformation is so different from most of his toys I'd recommend
this more than most other RID2015 Grimlock toys. It's just a solid, fairly
unique design all around-- recommended.
