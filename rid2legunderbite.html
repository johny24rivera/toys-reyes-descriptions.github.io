    Underbite's vehicle mode
is definitely a four-legged animal kinda crouched down as a vehicle, and
as such looks kinda lazy-- but it IS show-accurate. More show-accurate,
in fact, than the
    <a href="rid2underbite.html">

    </a>
    version,
as the four legs are actually situated fairly accurately. The feet of the
rear legs stick up a bit more than on the show model, but otherwise it's
pretty spot-on; the front legs are turned around to have red vents on the
front, and the front half of this mode actually does look pretty good because
of that. There's a futuristic streamlined black cockpit near the front,
and dual "ear-like" fins behind them. The rear portion is just way too
obviously the back legs, though, at least these legs fold back at the hips
during the transformation to make all four wheels on the same front-to-back
plane as each other. There isn't really any back end to this mode in terms
of a tailpipe or back bumper or anything-- just the top of the hips of
the robot legs. (These rear legs do slide into tabs, though, so the vehicle
mode stays together pretty well.) The purple plastic used for nearly all
of Underbite's plastic is a pretty darned nice shade, being dark and a
bit milky to make it look almost semi-metallic when the light hits it just
right (that said, an actual metallic plastic would've looked better). His
paint apps are pretty sparse, though, with just the vents and cockpit painted.
The black plastic is only on his wheels and some interior parts near the
back end around the hips.

    Underbite's robot/beast
mode is largely predictable after seeing his vehicle mode-- you straighten
out/rotate the legs around and then flip up the cockpit to reveal the robot
head, which was under the main body of the vehicle. This mode is pretty
much perfect in terms of proportions-- there's also no vehicle mode extras
whatsoever (the wheels in the legs look fine to me, I have no issue with
those). There's some great paint detailing on the head, with silver teeth,
a black lower jaw, and red on the eyes and center of the jaw "gear". There's
also some silver on the claws. Unfortunately, to be show-accurate he should
have several more red lines across his body, but at a Legion-class size
I guess I can't be too picky in this respect. The mold detailing is at
least there, with some nice angular details on the sides of his stomach
and rear legs especially, along with some "wire-like" designs near the
rear. For articulation in this mode, Underbite can move up-and-down at
the neck, as well as back-and-forth at the shoulders and hips and sideways
at the knees on the front two feet. I would've loved jaw movement, but
otherwise it's about as much as one could reasonably expect on a Legion
class toy.

    My main issue about
Underbite is his vehicle mode-- it's really weak, but it IS show-accurate,
which tempers how much I'm deducting from his score for it, despite how
lazy said vehicle mode is. The robot/beast mode is utterly fantastic, though,
with great, show-accurate proportions, some nice mold detailing, and decent
articulation for a Legion-class toy. It's a shame Underbite never got a
toy that looked this good in robot/beast mode at a larger scale, though--
given how huge he is on the show, a 3-step changer toy really would've
looked nice. This is my recommended version of the character if you want
one, easily.
