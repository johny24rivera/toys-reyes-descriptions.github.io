not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RiD Skyfire. For a review

     Everyone's favorite bumbling
idiot is back in his pre-Beast Wars form! I have to admit, this was one
of the biggest surprises of the Botcon 2006 exclusives, as I NEVER envisioned
the Skyfire mold being used for Waspinator-- using the right paint apps
makes all the difference! Darksyde Waspinator, who is named after the Predacon
ship which now has its own official name, has colors which are spot-on
with the
     <a href="10thwaspinator.html">
      10th Anniversary Edition
     </a>
     of
the toy, and ignoring the less show-accurate colors of the
     <a href="waspinator.html">
      original
Waspinator toy
     </a>
     . It's a beautiful color scheme on 10th Anniversary Waspinator,
and the same is true of this toy. Every shade of every color looks very
nice and contrasts well with the others, with no color being used too much
or two little. Black and white stripes on the edges of the wings, and the
a lesser extent on the front and back parts of the jet mode, help to keep
Waspinator's waspy feel in that mode, and in robot mode the yellow-and-black
patches on the arms and legs do the sasme. Using the metallic silvery blue
on the underside of the wings was also a great idea, to allude to the fact
that they become insect wings when Waspinator gets his beast mode. By far
the most ingenious use of Waspinator's many paint applications is on his
robot face. Painted the two small head crests like Waspinator's tiny head
antennae and painted his gas-mask-like mouth to look like mandibles was
an utter stroke of genius, pure and simple, and really brings out the Waspy-ness
in the face.

     No mold changes have
been made to Darksyde Waspinator, however, there have been numerous reports
of various misassemblies in the package. They range from easy fixes like
having the lower legs on the wrong upper legs, to very hard fixes like
on mine where the key lever that makes everything fit together perfectly
in both modes put in the wrong way, to impossible fixes like the toy coming
with two left hands and the like. Thus, if you're planning on getting this
toy, be sure to examine the package (or a picture of the package) VERY
carefully to ensure yours doesn't have a misassembly you won't be able
to fix. Also of note is that in addition to being a Botcon 2006 exclusive,
you could only buy Waspinator for a whopping $95 with Megatron at the convention--
it was not available free to preregistrants or available at all to those
who did not attend the convention. Waspinator is limited to 500 pieces,
so he's worth a pretty penny.

     Darksyde Waspinator
is an absolutely wonderful redeco of an admittedly mediocre toy. However,
the obvious care that was put into all the paint applications and picking
just the right colors puts this toy's score noticeably higher than it otherwise
would have been. If you're in the market for high-end toys and like the
character, I'd definitely recommend this toy-- just look at the toy carefully
before you buy it.

       In his own mind, "Waspinator" is destined
for a glorious reign atop the Predacon hierarchy. Sadly, his actual abilities
fall very short of this ideal. It is almost as if the Predacon warrior
is cursed. In vehicle mode he can achieve Mach 3.2 and is equipped with
the ability to generate a localized anti-gravity field that allows him
to stop almost instantaneously with little or no drift. His primary armaments
are two machine gun cannons built into the sides of his nose cone. In robot
mode, Waspinator wields a stun rifle that fires blasts of circuit-disrupting
energy. His optic sensors can emit destructive blasts at any target he
is looking at. Despite all this, his comrades do not respect him and his
enemies do not fear him. In battle, he is often dispatched in the most
gruesome manner possible, however Waspinator has an undeniably stubborn
spirit and refuses to give up his dreams. Megatron recognizes this quality
and seeks to exploit it to its maximum potential for his own benefit.
