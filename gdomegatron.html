    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Voyager
class Bludgeon. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge
of the Fallen Voyager class Bludgeon

     This version of Megatron--
both in terms of the alt mode and the general scheme-- is a homage to his
Generation 2 self, and even though the mold was, of course, primarily made
for Bludgeon, G2 Megatron's colors fit on it pretty well. Green is, of
course, appropriate as the main color for a tank, and in typical G2 fashion,
it's a rather light shade of green-- not quite to the point where I'd call
it "bright", but close. There's also a fair amount of deep purple in both
modes (but especially the robot mode), which... realistically, does not
go with green on a tank, but from a color scheme standpoint contrasts pretty
well. Alongside some brownish black on the treads and some other robot
parts, there's a smattering of several other colors on the toy. A rather
nice shade of light orange-red looks the best, in my opinion, on the bits
on his sides, and the various silver accents look pretty good, too. Some
other colors, such as the muddy brown, the off-white, and the bit of dull
grayish blue, not so much-- that said, they're not used much, and thus
don't really affect his overall look a lot. Generally his paint apps and
color layout go pretty well together, but I have three minor grievances.
The first is that, if you're going to go with such a blatantly unrealistic
color scheme as green and purple on a tank, you might as well go the whole
way and include the ridiculous "purple camo" spots on the tank mode that
the original G2 Megatron toy had. Also, the two large Decepticon symbols
seem rather randomly placed and are large enough to cover a significant
of mold detailing (particularly in tank mode)-- they're just more distracting
than they need to be. Also, because of the plastic layout, Megatron's tread
wheels are no less than FOUR colors-- the front wheel on each side is light
green, the second off-white, the middle three brownish black, and the back
two deep purple. It's a bit odd, and I wish some paint apps had been put
on there to make him look more uniform in that respect.

     Megatron has a new head
sculpt for this version, and it's a pretty good G2 Megatron comic-esque
head-- the purple face on the white head, the Joker-esque insane grin--
it works very well, so no complaints here.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Normally making any
other established character from a mold intended to be Bludgeon isn't a
good idea-- Bludgeon's so unique, what the samurai-look and the skeletal
appendages in robot mode, that it just doesn't work. However, for this
"G2 Megatron" homage, it works quite well. Giving G2 Megatron that "edge"
in robot mode with the swords and the skeletal-like appendages just looks
fitting somehow, particularly if you look at how he was often drawn in
the G2 comics. Recommended, particularly if you're a Megatron or G2 fan.

       Power is all that matters to Megatron.
It is his means, his motive, and his goal. It is the core of his being.
His every thought is only of how the might of his armies can bring ever
