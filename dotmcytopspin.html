    This is the only version
of DotM Topspin that has a non-weaponized (i.e., normal) vehicle mode,
and looks more like you might find him at a racing track. The vehicle mode
is robot extra-free, and the proportions are generally pretty good, though
the hood and windows could stand to "poke out" a bit more from the surrounding
body. Topspin's NASCAR car alt mode incorporates a pretty impressive amount
of paint details onto this small of a toy, with not only the big "LOWE'S"
logo on the front and the white paint along most other non-rimmed parts
of this mode, but he also has his "48" number on the sides and tiny versions
of his Chevrolet and Sprint/NASCAR logos. Unfortunately, the "48" yellow
isn't solid enough-- when the plastic it's on goes from painted white to
the dark blue plastic underneath on the bottom half of the car doors, the
yellow itself gets a bit darker as well, so it's a bit "see-through" and
doesn't look that great. On the other hand, all the white contrasts with
the dark blue quite well in this mode, and the windows are painted not
just black, but a metallic shade of black, which looks a bit better and
more "glittery" under stronger light. The taillights are the only major
details in this mode that aren't painted, which is unusual on a Legion-class
toy. The mold detailing in this mode is unusually sparse for a movie toy,
even considering the relative sleekness of the race car mode; the car door
side details aren't even molded into the toy, for example.

    Topspin's robot mode,
however... oof. I get that they were trying to do a bit of a different
transformation for a car legion-class toy, but this is NOT the way to do
it. The arms are absolutely horrible, with literally halves of the front
two-thirds of the alt mode hanging off each arm, which is a LOT of kibble.
The gun-things above his shoulders aren't represented well, either, and
the arms are rather 2-D, which only adds insult to injury. On the plus
side, though, the chest, waist, and head are quite well-done for this scale,
with tons of little mold detailing bits and Topspin's signature "hair"
painted dark blue on his headsculpt, along with his "sunglasses" being
painted a nice light metallic blue. The legs are a bit fat proportionally,
and I can't exactly tell where the knees are supposed to be, but for the
scale they're passable, and Topspin's flip-out feet provide a decent amount
of balance for him. As for articluation, Topspin can't move much, even
for the size class-- at the hips, forward-and-back at the elbows (yup,
his big car-shell kibble bits pretty much completely eliminate any useful
shoulder articulation), and his ankles can tilt forward a bit due to the
transformation.

    Legion class DotM Topspin
has a pretty well-done vehicle mode and a pretty nice number of paint apps
in said mode, but his robot mode is just bad. The huge shells of his car
hanging off his arms are big eyesores, and add to that his overly chubby
legs and 2-D arms, and you've got only the "core" part of the robot looking
decent. I highly recommend just saving up the little extra money and buying
the

      The harder the job, the more Autobot
Topspin likes it. If he doesn't return from a mission dented and leaking
transmission fluid, he considers it a failure. Scratches and dings are
badges of honor to him-- signs that he has lived thorugh all that life
has to throw at him, and come out smiling.
