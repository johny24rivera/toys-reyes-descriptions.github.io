    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM voyager
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original DotM voyager Optims Prime toy

     Optimus Prime's "Fireburst"
color scheme, as a whole, doesn't change too much from his normal color
scheme. The red's still there on the front of the truck and on part of
the upper body, and he still has those various shades of grays and blues
on him. However, the gray used on Prime is SLIGHTLY lighter in color than
on the original DotM voyager, and a tad brownish too. Honestly, it looks
a tad ugly/dirty; I would have preferred that they had stuck with the original
light gray, as boring as it was. The dark blue is also a very, VERY dark
blue, almost to the point of being black-- another color change that, by
itself, makes him look a bit worse, overall. However, what really makes
Fireburst Optimus Prime shine are the "fiery" parts of his deco. No longer
does he have flames on the side of his truck mode, but orange cracks resembling
magma-- it contrasts extremely well against the dark blue, along with the
light orange paint apps on his fuel tanks. The coolest addition of all,
though, has to be his transparent orange and red plastic. On the original
DotM voyager, I didn't know why he had so much transparent plastic-- it
was mostly clear, and looked rather ugly and out-of-place on the figure.
That is most DEFINITELY not the case here-- the top of his roof and truck
nose are now a fiery orange plastic that not only goes great with the dark
blue, but is also patterned to look like cooling magma, with the dark blue
paint on the transparent orange/red slowly tapering off the farther along
you go on the figure. It's a very cool effect, and the transparent red
windows also help add to his "fiery" theme a bit more.

     Fireburst Optimus Prime's
core figure doesn't have any mold changes, but he has a new Mechtech weapon.
In its normal mode it's a long-barreled blaster, but by pressing down on
a small tab on the underside of the weapon his transparent axe halves come
together at the top to form a mighty battle axe! Even better, unlike most
Mechtech weapons it can actually stay locked in this mode at least somewhat
securely, and just plain looks cool with all the detailing on the transparent
orange plastic, like it's an "energy axe" or something.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Fireburst Optimus Prime's
main colors are either the same as the original DotM voyager Optimus' or
a little worse, but his awesome fiery paint app effects and transparent
plastic more than overcome them. I wish his robot mode looked a bit more
different instead of most of the changes being to his vehicle mode, and
that there had been at least one MAJOR color change, but it still catches
the eye in vehicle mode and is the version of this mold I'd recommend the
most.

       Optimus Prime fights with the utmost
valor, courage and power. His dominance over the Decepticons is due to
countless centuries of battle experience, a might armament and a virtuous
Spark. Even so, widespread threats to the Autobots and Optimus Prime still
exist-- there is no time to rest, there is no time for defeat, there is
only time for victory!
