    Judging from concept
art, Slash here was apparently going to be in the movie at one point, but
was cut for whatever reason (budget/length). Regardless, Slash's alternate
mode is a velociraptor made almost entirely of knives and edges-- another
new Dinobot who follows the tried-and-true one-syllable "S"-word name schtick.
His proportions in this mode are very close to perfect, with even the underbelly
of the mode not being too bulky. There's a couple of minor "bars" on the
sides of his main body, but that's about it as far as robot extras in this
mode. And what a mode it is-- Slash is just CHOCK full of blades everywhere,
from his tail to the back of his arms and legs to the back of his neck
and head, all simulating the partially feathered appearance that most archaeologists
currently believe velociraptors had. Because he has so many large spikes,
Slash has a lot of rubbery, bendy plastic-- pretty much all the yellow-ish
green bits are soft plastic, with the exception of the underside of his
neck. They don't seem to be particularly "stretched" in their positions
in either mode, though, so I don't foresee this being an issue for those
of you worried about warping. Beyond all the points, Slash's mold detailing
still looks rather cool, with an embedded red mechanical eye, a rather
unique black-painted crest on his nose, plenty of teeth, and intricate
armor-like detailing on his neck and lower legs. The color scheme for Slash
is one of the wildest of all the movie Dinobots, being mostly turquoise
and yellowish-green with a bit of black to help bring a bit of "dark" to
him. It's a rather neat, "tropical" color scheme that actually makes some
of his spikes look like ferns or palm tree leaves, and certainly stands
out a movieverse shelf. The colors are broken up pretty well, with no one
color being too dominant in any one place-- always a good thing. The yellowish
green paint on the neck, the aforementioned painted head crests and silver
teeth, the red for the dino eyes, and the nice black fade on the upper
back and the turqouise fade on the tail all look marvelous; no issues there.
Slash is also fairly articulated in this mode, being able to move at the
jaw, shoulders, hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and rotation
at the ankles to help him stand stably. I wish his tail could've had some
movement (given his weapon storage, it's impossible for his arms to move
at the elbows given the transformation), but all in all he can move to
a pretty good extent in this mode.

    Slash's transformation
is a bit more complicated than you'd expect, though still not what I'd
call particularly difficult. His head and neck (more or less) become his
feet with a few twists and turns, while his dino legs become the arms,
the tail hangs off the back, and the dino chest becomes large shoulder-claw
armor bits. The only somewhat tricky part is that the sides of his entire
body slide around the midsection during the transformation, and certain
pieces have to be out of the way to properly do this. The end result is...
well, let's just say the dino mode was certainly a priority for Slash.
The big issue here is the sheer amount of dino mode extras hanging off.
The feet are very obviously visible stuck on the back of the lower arms,
the dino arms just hang off behind the shoulders unceremoniously, the entire
tail section also hangs off the back (and way down behind Slash's lower
legs), and the dino head sits behind his lower legs in a somewhat disjointed/fragmented
but still obvious manner. (That said, the lower jaw half makes for a great
heel on each foot, so Slash is pretty stable.) The rubbery plastic "fern"
pieces on his upper back in dino mode also form some kind of weird fan
pieces in front of his crotch, like some sort of fern-loincloth. The proportions
are also slightly off in a few areas-- the arms are a bit short proportionallly,
while the legs are a bit two-dimensional, being considerably wider from
a side-on view than a front-on view. The waist is also a bit skinny. That
said, having the dino stomach split into big claw-like pieces that fit
over his shoulders was a stroke of genius, keeping this mode looking nice
and "sharp", even if I wish they were painted black to match his dino claws.
Slash's mold detailing on his robot mode pieces is a bit more "fossilized"
in its look than in dino mode, with the armor plating on his chest actually
looking like it has little nautilus-like swirls in it. He has the AoE Dinobot-standard
"pointy knight shoes", and his head does look like a helmet, though not
as obvious a one as on, say,
    <a href="aoeslug.html">
     Slug
    </a>
    ; the top of
the head and his mouth are rather ridged like a shell, and he has a lone
red visor that helps complete the look quite well. For weapons, the rubbery
"feathers" under Slash's dino arms come off and form hand-held axes-- a
creative usage of those pieces, and given that his dino arms aren't otherwise
used in this mode, these weapons can be stored someplace other than Slash's
fists in this mode. For articulation, Slash can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows, waist rotation (limited because of the "ferns"
in front and the tail in back), and movement at the hips, knees (at two
points) and front-and-back a little at the toes. It should also be mentioned
that because of the lack of clearance, Slash's elbow articulation also
isn't very ranged-- thus, his articulation is okay, but not as good as
you'd think from the list, given that and all the dino extras on his body.

    Dinobot Slash has an
excellent velociraptor mode, with some fantastic mold detailing, a very
unique look, and some "tropical" coloring that really makes him stand out
on any shelf. His transformation is also quite inventive. That said, his
robot mode pays for such a great dino mode, with lots of obnoxious kibble,
some odd proportions here and there, and somewhat limited articulation
in important places like the elbows. Because of said robot mode, overall
he's my least favorite of the "mainline" AoE Dinobot molds.
