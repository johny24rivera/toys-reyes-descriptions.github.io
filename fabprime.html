    Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode is pretty good, at least when it comes to proportions-- unlike some
other Fast Action Battlers, Prime's truck mode isn't chibified very much,
with the only real proportional difference being that the front bumper
is a bit bigger than it should be. There aren't really any robot extras
either, though as his truck body trails off to the rear hauler section,
it's pretty obvious his robot chest is back there, as some details of the
robot mode are easily seen on that area of the truck mode. What is dissapointing
about this mode, however, are the details. Optimus Prime's color scheme
is way too dull, especially for a toy aimed at younger kids. There's no
bright colors whatsoever, except for the transparent hook weapon that's
used primarily in robot mode. Even the flame paint apps really don't add
much to this mode, as there aren't enough of them for a toy of this size--
in fact, there really aren't enough paint apps period on Prime for a toy
of this size-- the windows are just left a dull gray, which looks really,
REALLY boring. His front bumper is also half-gray, half-blue, which looks
pretty weird. (As a minor aside, the hole for the missile in robot mode
being right there almost in the center of the front grill is rather distracting.)
The mold detailing is fair on most of the vehicle mode, though it's much
better in robot mode-- some spots on the top of the truck mode are especially
barren of detail.

    Optimus' robot mode,
however, is quite good, especially for a Fast Action Battler. The truck
bed becomes a sizable backpack in this mode, but it fits behind the body
very well and doesn't hinder articulation, so I don't mind it much. (The
square shells on the sides of his shoulders, though, look rather bad.)
Prime's proportions are pretty much spot-on in this mode, with his upper
arms being slightly smaller than they should be. (Well, and the lower arms
are just blocks with detailing of the lower arms in them, but some sacrifices
obviously have to be made to get Prime's complicated design into a deluxe-sized
toy, not to mention they're necessarily for the gimmick.) Prime's chest
and head are detailed extremely well, both in terms of the mold and the
paint job, though on his other parts he lacks enough paint apps, like in
his truck mode. Prime has excellent articulation for a FAB-- he can move
at the head, shoulders, elbows, waist (in that odd "one-way-only, and if
you let go of it it snaps back into place" way that nearly all FABs have),
hips, and knee articulation, and some of those are on ball joints so you
can get a fair amount of poses out of him. As for Prime's gimmick, his
left hand can fire a spring-loaded hook-missile. The hook's attached to
his back on a string, though, so I really don't see the point of having
it fire-- it's not like it can go far. Using it as a more general wrecking
hook is pretty cool, though.

    Overall, though he has
his flaws Optimus Prime is one of the best toys in the Fast Action Battler
subline. He has a great robot mode, and a fairly good truck mode as well.
His unnecessarily dull color scheme and lack of enough paint apps make
his score lower than it otherwise would be.

      Optimus Prime is the most powerful Autobot
in the universe. His armored body is without weakness, and his weapon systems
are advanced beyond anything ever before seen on Earth. His Power Hook
fires a pulse-blast of explosive energy or a matter hook that can snatch
and hang on to nearby objects. He is the mightiest defender of freedom
this or any other world has ever seen!
