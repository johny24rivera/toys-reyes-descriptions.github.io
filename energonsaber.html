       Scattor is a remold of
Armada Jetstorm, and, like the other Energon Saber remolds, it's an aesthetic
remold to a part of his vehicle mode; nothing articulation-related or anything
like that has been changed, so in those respects, he's like his previous
mold versions. Scattor is a futuristic-style jet with four butterfly-like
wings. It's actually very cool-looking. The detailing on those parts is
also pretty mecha-futuristic, too, so it adds wonderfully to the whole
flavor Scattor has going for him. The butterfly wings also work great in
his robot mode, too; it looks like Scattor's got a pair on insect wings
on his back that he can flutter instead of just triangular straight plane
wings. The color scheme also works fairly nice, too, although I would have
perhaps changed the brownish-gray to a more solid gray. The transparent
yellow "non-aligned" Energon plastic used for the main body is also a nice
touch.

         Skyboom, a remold of
Armada Sonar, has probably the least significant remold out of the three
Team members. Basically all that's been done to him mold-wise is the addition
of another small pair of wings nearer to the front. They look pretty nice,
but the futuristic detailing used on the transparent bits on the center
are directly in contrast to the "just modern" detailing on the rest of
Skyboom. It just doesn't mesh very well. The color scheme tends to work
fairly well, though- I have the same comments for it on Skyboom as I do
on Scattor.

           Wreckage is the member
of the team that is a remold of Armada Runway. He also has the most extensive
remold- his vehicle mode is now almost entirely different- with a VERY
cool, "futuristic jet" look to it. I especially love the thin-windowed
cockpit and "mouth" intake valve near the front. I mean, the vehicle mode
just looks so awesome that it's easy to ignore all that undercarriage robot
mode junk (not to mention it does a slightly better job of covering it
up). However, the flip side to this is that in robot mode, the cockpit
jutting out from his butt is even larger and more distracting than before.
Still, it's a small price to pay for such an awesome vehicle mode. As for
the color scheme, again, I have the same comments here as I had with Scattor.

             The Energon Saber certainly
looks more solid and less fragmented than its predecessors, but it still
barely resembles a sword. The colors and detailing are great, though, and
I'd definitely prefer to put this puppy in a Transformers' hand over either
of the previous Minicon Sabers. I especially like how Scattor's front wings
semi-lock into place in between Skyboom's front shuttle halves. It makes
the saber less likely to fall apart.

             <font face="OCR A Extended">
              The Energon Saber Team
is certainly an improvement over its predecessors, with improved sculpting
on all and improved colors on most. Highly recommended if you don't have
either of the previous versions of this Minicon Team; otherwise, only recommended
after you get the Terrorcons and Omnicons.

                The Energon saber is considered one
of the most powerful weapons in the universe. This legendary sword is the
combined form of the Mini-Cons Wreckage, Scattor, and Skyboom, three individuals
who understand the importance of teamwork. Allied with the heroic Autobots,
they are an important element in the ongoing struggle against the evil
Decepticons. More importantly, they may be the ultimate key that can save
the cosmos from the threat of Megatron and the mighty Unicron.
