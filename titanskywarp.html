    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War Within
Thundercracker

     War Within Skywarp here
is the fourth use of the War Within Thundercracker mold, and following
in the tradition of Skywarps, he's primarily purple and black. If you've
read any of my reviews of previous Skywarp toys, you probably know by now
that I absolutely love Skywarp's color scheme, but the particular shades
of those colors used on this toy are particularly stunning. The shade of
purple goes just wonderfully with all of the other colors, being not too
light, but not too dark, either. The silver is a particularly nice shade,
but what is really striking are the red accent paint apps, which are of
a vibrant (but not too light/bright) color, and really give some great
contrast to the figure. And Skywarp has no shortage of paint apps, either,
so he looks all decked up in either mode.

     War Within Skywarp is
my favorite Titanium, bar none-- even considering the slightly-inflated
San Diego Comic-Con exclusive price. He's using one of the best Titanium
molds as his base, and in an utterly fantastic color scheme with tons of
paint apps. What's not to like?

       Out of sight, out of mind. Those are
the words Skywarp lives by, even though he doesnt necessarily know it
himself. When Megatron is around, hes the most loyal of Decepticons, always
standing rigidly at attention, acquiescing to every order given. Unfortunately,
as soon as his commander walks out of the room, all thought of orders,
protocol and practicality go with him. Its not that Skywarp has a problem
with authority. He just doesnt care, is all. Hed rather be strafing unarmed
noncombatants than engaging in risky missions.

     <br/>
     <i>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       The only thing that bugs him more than
having to follow orders is having to work alongside guys with a lot of
personal motivation. Guys like Starscream. When he isnt going on and on
about how much better a commander his is than Megatron, hes forcing Skywarp
into some new scheme to replace the big guy. Megatron is winning the war
for the Decepticons. Why cant Starscream just shut up and enjoy the ride?
