    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Wars Jawbreaker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Wars Jawbreaker

     I'll be straightforward
about this guy; Frostbite has one of the best paint jobs of any Universe
toy, and that's a HUGE compliment. Frostbite looks absolutely fantastic;
the dull whites, purples, and blues just go together incredibly well to
create exactly the look that Frostbite's name implies; a cruel, arctic-themed
Decepticon. I mean, on a hyena, of all creatures, you don't think an arctic
scheme would work, but it really does. Frostbite, as is typical with Universe
toys, has a ton of paint detailing on him; nearly every mechanical mold
detail on him has some paint on it, and given that he's a Transmetal 2
repaint, that means that he's got a LOT of the stuff on him. (The Energon
radiation apps are the purpleish spray apps on the top of his beast mode,
I think...) Many of the colors are used only once or twice (like on the
eyes, chest, or upper legs), giving him a more unique, asymmetrical, twisted
look than he already has. (And, of course, since this mold is a Decepticon
now, it certainly works.) Unfortunately, he DOES just have a Decepticon
symbol painted over his spark crystal, which looks kinda cheap, but that
is common among all Universe figs, so I can't fault Frostbite in particular
here.

     Frostbite is a definite
step above his mold predecessor Jawbreaker, and even Jawbreaker had a pretty
good color scheme. The arctic scheme, along with the plethora of mold and
paint detailing on Frostbite, makes him one of the best Universe repaints
yet. Highly recommended if you like beast TFs.
