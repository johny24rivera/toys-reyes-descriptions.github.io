    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the DotM Skyhammer toy.

     I'm pretty sure the presence
of this toy is the likely result of Drift having a helicopter mode in the
movie that was a complete surprise to Hasbro, given how often it's "mentioned"
in the movie (i.e., never). Still, this redeco of Skyhammer into Drift
works surprisingly well. Sure, it's a different scale of helicopter, and
the robot shoulders bear no resemblance to Drift's design, but the rotors
are around the chest-- sorta kinda like Drift's "rotor" swords behind his
back on the movie model-- and the robot feet look similar, though he doesn't
have the "samurai armor" look on the legs. The general FEEL of the helicopters
are also fairly similar, too. Hasbro pretty well aced it on the color scheme.
A dark navy blue (but not QUITE as dark as on most of the other AoE car
Drift toys) and a medium blue contrast and complement each other quite
well, but if it and the little bit of black (on a few pieces such as the
rotors) were it, Drift would come across pretty boring. Luckily, Hasbro
put in a bit more "gold" that shows through in both modes-- not just the
robot mode-- with a brownish goldish plastic that I admittedly have some
fears will eventually succumb to Gold Plastic Syndrome-- it is pretty much
that exact shade. No crumbling issues, yet, though, as of this writing
(12/17). There's also some bronze paint-- not gold, but bronze-- on a few
pieces like the blades and robot face. On the one hand, these areas are
supposed to be more gold than bronze, but on the other hand, it fits with
the plastic shade better. The paint apps-- particularly the light blue--
are spread across the toy pretty well in both modes as well, preventing
Drift from looking boring with large patches of just one color shade in
either mode.

     Drift does have two
mold changes (or three, depending upon how you want to count them); first,
obviously he has a new headsculpt, which fits his movie model head spot-on
and looks great. No complaints there. Skyhammer's Mechtech weapon has also
been replaced with fairly large sword accessories which can clip together
to form a larger blade, though honestly the blade is a bit too wide in
the combined configuration, so I tend to keep them seperate. They look
pretty cool with the bronze paint app on the blade, and in addition to
(obviously) fitting into Drift's hands in robot mode, they can also tab
onto the ends of his wings in helicopter mode for vehicle storage. Huzzah!

     The voyager helicopter
Drift toy may be a remold, but the mold fits Drift surprisingly well (despite
still having definite, obvious dissimilarities), and the colors are well
spread out while also staying faithful to Drift's colors on his other AoE
toys. The new headsculpt is good (and basically required), but the swords
are great accessories that store in both modes, much better than Skyhammer's
Mechtech weapon. Top all this off with a mold that was one of the best
of its line, and this is a solid recommendation for anyone who wants an
articulated toy of AoE Drift that becomes a helicopter. (If you want a
more closely movie-accurate one but don't care about articulation, though,
try the

       Drift is a bot of few words and many
blades. He's not trying to hide his Decepticon past. At this point he'd
much rather just let his swords do the talking. His mastery of combat tactics
not only lets him adapt his alternate form to land- or air-based battles,
but maintain total control over his circuits, even under heavy enemy fire.
While other bots are pushed toward overload, Drift soldiers on with steely
tactical precision.
