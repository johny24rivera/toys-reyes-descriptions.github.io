not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Dead End.

     mass-released, Bluestreak
helps complete the "Datsun" trio for the Combiner Wars line-- but not QUITE
in the way that you'd think. Instead of his usual silver/red color scheme,
Bluestreak here is actually based on a blue Diaclone version of the mold.
It's quite the change, but a positive one, in my opinion-- the blue plastic
used for most of Bluestreak is quite an attractive shade of the color,
being almost a periwinkle shade of the color. The silver paint on the entire
front hood section looks marvelous, and there's some silver used on the
shotgun, sirens, and wheel hubs, and the robot chest as well. Along with
the silver, my other favorite color combo is the flat white plastic used
for his upper legs, middle of the arms, and some connector parts around
his head. It really contrasts well in robot mode, though because of the
mold breakup this means that there's two weird abnormal white stripes on
the sides of the vehicle mode. (It should be noted that FunPub released
a sticker set that-- among many other things-- had blue stickers to put
over these pieces to fix this problem since these pieces are made of unpaintable
plastic, but I didn't think it worth the money-- it's not THAT big of a
deal, to me.) There's also a pretty good amount of black to give Bluestreak
a "dark" color among his many shades, mostly relegated to his tires, his
combiner pegs, waist, and lower arms and legs. I absolutely LOVE all the
colors added to Bluestreak's lower chest and legs in robot mode to try
to "replicate" the details from his G1 Diaclone toy. There's several square
silver-lined details on the legs and feet, whether they be purple, orangish
yellow and black, a more "normal" yellow, or red. It really looks nice,
and makes it look like his feet are made of his rear bumper even though
they're not. The forest green paint apps on the abs also look marvelous,
and fit right in with the blue. Bluestreak's face has the usual silver,
along with yellow for the eyes and headcrest, though the yellow isn't quite
"solid" enough to stand out against the darker blue plastic behind it--
the blue "bleeds through" a little on the headcrest, making the yellow
look a bit duller than it should. Last and least, Bluestreak's hand/foot/gun
is a rather flat light gray-- nothing remarkable.

     Bluestreak has the same
mold changes made to the Dead End mold for
     <a href="cwstreetwise.html">
      Streetwise
     </a>
     and the same headsculpt as Prowl and Smokescreen, but no mold changes have
been made for this release specifically.

     Combiner Wars Bluestreak
may be another redeco of a mold that's been redecoed/remolded a ton, but
it's one of my favorite molds from the entire Combiner Wars line, and done
in absolutely beautiful colors with a ton of lovely paint apps, to boot.
The choice to make Bluestreak "Diaclone blue" to mix things up a little
is a decision I wholeheartedly approve of, as well. He's easily my favorite
of the various "surprise" TFSS figures over the year (he was only revealed
once people got Impactor, who was the last toy released in TFSS 4.0).

       Bluestreak travels over the endless
rubble and ruin that was once landscape of Cybertron. The abject destruction
surrounds him, taking him back to when his spark was young. When he witnessed
the annihilation of his home-city and its inhabitants. It was then that
he vowed to do everything he could to fight the Decepticons and their cause,
eventually enlisting under Optimus Prime and trained as a Combat Gunner.
Without natural brute strength or an arsenal like other Autobots such as
Impactor, Bluestreak chose to use the cover of shadows to inflict maximum
damage upon the Decepticon ranks. Using experimental "Stealth Tech" developed
in a joint effort with Wheeljack, Medix, and Mirage, Bluestreak is able
to go nearly unseen by the Decepticons, even with their vastly superior
radar and detection technology. Bluestreak emits a faint blue shimmer when
in Stealth Mode. Decepticons that have survived encounters with Bluestreak
speak of an angelic specter in the distance, before a hail of blaster fire
rains down upon them.
