    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Combiner Wars
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original CW Optimus Prime mold

     As has tended to be the
norm for the character in more recent times, Motormaster uses the same
base mold as Optimus Prime-- but this time around, not just a straight
redeco, but a VERY highly remolded version. The same basic structure of
all modes and transformation has been kept the same for Motormaster, but
with the exception of the legs and a few other minor pieces like the hands,
nearly every other piece has been remolded to give Motormaster a meaner,
more angular look, particularly in his truck mode. The angular wind vanes,
the sloped front grill, the VERY square back halves/combiner chest with
"rivets" molded in, the combiner crotch piece-- it's pretty much all diagonals
and hard angles, which certainly fits Motormaster's "brute force" approach.
In robot mode he's got a more angular chest with little greebly "mechanical
bits" around his upper abs and upper chest. Motormaster's headsculpt is
pretty much spot-on, fitting his G1 "head-in-a-box" sculpt while not making
it look too awkward. He's got a character-appropriate, no-nonsense look
on his face. His new headsculpt for his combiner torso mode-- Menasor's--
isn't nearly as great. It's too... round, for lack of a better word. The
head should have been more angular and a bit wider to fit in with the rest
of Motormaster's sculpting-- same with the horns, which look great outside
of being a bit too "smooth". The interior of the combiner chest when opened
up looks awesome, with a round "spark chamber" and a bunch of molded-in
"circuitry" lines leading to it-- if it wasn't for how hollow it looked
without Blackjack in there, I'd leave it open in combined mode. Motormaster
has a different weapon than CW Optimus Prime, with it being a sword-shaped
blaster and a small sword that-- surprise!-- combine into a large sword
for Menasor to wield. The two halves of the sword clip together fairly
securely behind the truck mode for storage. As far as mold tolerances,
Motormaster's joints are very much the same as Optimus'-- including, unfortunately,
that the ratchets in his hips are slightly "off", with it impossible to
get both legs completely straight with each other, at least on the intial
release. This was fixed on later releases of Motormaster.

     As far as colors, Motormaster
is mostly gray-- and unfortunately not a metallic gray either, but a rather
blah milky gray. (The exception is the combiner chest, which has some nice
dark metallic gunmetal gray paint.) Thankfully Motormaster's gray is not
light-- milky light gray is the worst on TFs, at least for me-- but it,
along with the black, makes for some rather bland main colors. The purple
really helps a LOT, whether it's the light metallic purple on the windows
in vehicle mode or the darker purple on the robot mode or the pastel purple
on Motormaster's square face. That said, although there's an adequate amount
of purple amongst all the black, silver and gray in Motormaster's robot
mode, in vehicle mode there isn't quite enough of the light metallic purple
for my liking. There's also just a tad of (VERY) dull metallic gold used
for the headlights, which looks okay, but they really should've used a
lighter shade of the color for better contrast. Also-- as has been the
case traditionally-- Menasor's head has nice light red eyes, to emphasize
how eeeevil he is.

     Motormaster is much
more than just a Combiner Wars Optimus Prime redeco, with nearly the entire
toy remolded to look more angular and Decepticon-y. (The beefy proportions
in robot mode also suit him a little better than Optimus.) His robot mode
headsculpt is also great, though his Menasor head looks slightly "off".
As much as I love the more angular, dynamic remolding, however, Motormaster's
color scheme of mostly gray and black is pretty dull. The purple saves
it a bit, but generally I'm not a fan of his color scheme, which is the
only reason he doesn't rate above CW Optimus Prime in my book. Still, if
you want to make CW Menasor... well, you don't really have any other options,
do you? And it's not like he's a TERRIBLE toy by any means, just the weakest
torso mold in the line in a generally bland color scheme (G1-accurate or
not).
