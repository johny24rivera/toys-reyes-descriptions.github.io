    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Wolverine. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     As opposed to most redecos
nowadays, brown costume Wolverine is more of a straight pallette swap than
an actual, completely different Transformer with new paint apps and the
"works". His black and yellow parts are still all exactly the same and
in exactly the same places compared to the original Wolverine TF, along
with the white, yellow, and silver paint apps. The main difference is that
the original Wolverine TF's blue has been changed to, obviously a dark
brown. It's a straight color-swap, which makes it a bit more bland and
unimaginative than it otherwise would have been, unfortunately. Less obvious
changes are that the tires are a bit more of a brownish gray compared to
a straight gray-- which of course complements the main color better-- and
the interior of the wheels is now painted black, not silver, which works
just as well, in my opinion. The black is also used a bit more liberally
on the chest stripes.

     No mold changes have
been made to the brown-costumed version of Wolverine.

     I wish a bit more had
been done to brown-costumed Wolverine besides just turning the blue to
brown and a few other minor changes, but it IS a signficant color swap,
so he easily looks different-- and of course, it's accurate to Wolverine's
brown costume design. I like it a bit more than the original release of
this toy, but if you're gonna get one version, get the X-Force redeco instead.

       Built to match the toughness and ferocity
of Wolverine himself, this battle suit is fast, scrappy, and able to take
a pounding that would turn other mechs into scrap. Advanced repair systems
fix most damage done almost instantly. In addition, the mech mode pops
out claws sharp enough to rip through almost any armor.
