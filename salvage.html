    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Dropkick. For a review

     Salvage's vehicle mode
is an homage to the old TV show
     <i>
      Sanford &amp; Son
     </i>
     -- the truck is
fairly close to the truck used on the show in design, and now the color
scheme is pretty much spot-on, being all a plain red with "Sparkplug &amp;
Son Salvage" written on the side, with Sparkplug taking the place of Sanford,
obviously. In vehicle mode, though, Salvage looks rather plain because
of the homage, with only his front and rear bumpers being painted (with
the exception of the logos on the doors). In robot mode, however, this
definitely changes. Salvage has a TON of colors visible in this mode, and
they all blend together flawlessly. I especially like how the "Allspark
blue" contrasts so well with the red and orange in this mode, and used
as an accent color is just looks incredible. Gray/silver makes a nice secondary
color, though most of the gray actually consists of three different shades--
the normal dull light milky gray, used on the guns and a few of the small
bits, silver paint, and a really nice-looking gunmetal gray that looks
slightly metallic.

     No mold changes have
been made to Salvage, though the shoulders on mine clip together considerably
better than on my Dropkick-- no idea if this is widespread, though.

     Salvage may not be much
to look at in vehicle mode-- though he is a cool homage-- but he more than
makes up for it in robot mode, with a ton of cool colors all coming together
very well and in just the right amounts, particularly the Allspark Power
electric blue. Recommended slightly over Dropkick.

       Another of the new Autobots brought
to life by the final, energetic bursts from the AllSpark, Salvage doesnt
really have a lot of ambition. Before being brought to life, he worked
with Sparkplug &amp; Son Salvage, and hes pretty sure he was happy then.
Hes certain hes happy now, with a load of scrap in the back, and Sparkplugs
hands in their accustomed place on his worn old steering wheel. Its a
simple life, but its one he prefers to hunting Decepticons and fighting
all the time.
