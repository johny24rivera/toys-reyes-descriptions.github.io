    Bumblebee here is another
Animated character that oddly is packaged as a Universe toy, even though
the Animated toyline was out at the same time. Regardless, in vehicle mode
Bumblebee is a very cartoon-ized compact sportscar. What's interesting
is that it's a bit less cartoony than the
    <a href="anibumblebee.html">
     mainline
deluxe toy
    </a>
    -- this seems to be a trend with the Animated Legends. Whether
this is because of the restrictions of the size class or just something
to help make them fit ever-so-slightly more into the Universe 2.0 line,
I'd say in this case it looks a bit better. Having Bumblebee's car mode
being a more realistic length and not so "smushed up" looks well. He has
the typical yellow-and-black Bumblebee colors, though gray windows for
some reason. That's the only complaint I have about Bumblebee's paint apps--
gray windows just don't look good against the yellow, there's not enough
contrast. A darker color--preferably some shade of blue--should have been
used instead, methinks. The necessary details are all here, such as Bumblebee's
one black stripe, painted police siren, and some other minor mold detailing
(though given that he's an Animated-style toy, he doesn't have much mold
detailing, of course). There's no robot extras whatsoever in this mode,
though there are two rather unsightly gaps in the front of the vehicle
mode due to the transformation.

    I rather like Bumblebee's
transformation, it's rather unique for something as simple as a Legends
class toy. He has the traditional "doors become arms, half of the vehicle
mode becomes feet" look of many of the car-mode Legends figures, but his
entire roof piece (and the connected legs) spins around during transformation,
which is pretty cool on this size figure. In robot mode, Bumblebee has
an odd mix of Animated and "traditional" styling when it comes to his proportions--
the legs and arms are definitely traditionally styled (though the arm detailing
molded onto the car doors is more exaggerated in style than usual), but
his chest and head are definitely pretty much spot-on show-accurate. (As
a side note, the gray used for his face is really dark-- it's hard to make
out his trademark smirk amid a color that dark.) And even though his legs
are made up of different parts of the car mode than the deluxe toy, they're
still close enough to the show model to pass off as looking fairly show-accurate.
As far as articulation, Bumblebee's is fairly decent for a Legends class
figure-- he can move up-and-down where the head meets the neck (but not
at the base of the neck), as well as at the shoulders (at two points),
hips, and knees, and the shoulders and hips are on ball joints so you can
get increased movement from those points.

    Universe 2.0 Legends
Animated Bumblebee is a pretty good Legends toy, looking pretty decent
in both modes despite the small scale and limited budget. His proportions
are solid, he has enough paint apps, and he still manages to look fairly
show-accurate despite his size. Easily my favorite of the Animated Legends
toys.
