    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Battle Charger
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     The Battle Charger Stealth
Bumblebee has a color scheme that tends to follow the typical Movie Bumblebee
repaint, what with switching the amounts of yellow and black on the toy.
I think this pretty much always looks better, as I'm not a huge fan of
yellow as a main color, but as an accent color I think it works much better.
However, the "Cyberglyphs" all across Bumblebee's car doors and on his
front hood stripes really look nifty, and way more interesting than just
plain yellow stripes. The dark metallic blue used for the windows is also
a great color, and the more-or-less reversed colors on Bumblebee's robot
mode parts look pretty nice as well, with the silver serving as a decent
(if overused) accent color. However, the one downside to all this Cyberglyph-ing
up of the vehicle mode is that a lot of the details on Bumblebee's front
and back ends aren't filled in with paint.

     Stealth Bumblebee is
the best of the Battle Charger molds with the most interesting overall
color scheme as well. Thus, it's obviously the one I'd recommend the most
to those who want to pick up any figure from this small sub-line.

       When speed and stealth are what matter,
Optimus Prime calls on Bumblebee to do the job! He's not just the fastest
Autobot on wheels, he's also the best at sneaking around right under the
grilles of the Decepticons.
