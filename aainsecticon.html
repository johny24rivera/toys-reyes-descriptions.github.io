    Insecticon here is the
same little insect Transformer that appeared briefly in one scene in Revenge
of the Fallen (and was fairly promptly squashed by Sam). His beast mode
is a very interesting and unique design, being both a rather spindly insect
byt recognizably robotic. For an insect Transformer the legs are surprisingly
long (though accurate, both in terms of real insects and compared to its
CG model), and the other proportions are quite well done, too-- the snail
shell-like detailing on the abdomen, the fragmented look of the wings,
the excellent design of the insect face, with a single optic peaking out
behind four jaw-like structures-- all VERY cool-looking. The robot head
is fairly obvious in this mode, though (its only significant drawback)--
the front of the wings cover it up a little, but generally it's just sitting
right there in the middle of the mode, which is a bit of an eyesore. The
color scheme of pale brownish green and light gray is a bit dull, but fitting
for the character and hardly a "bad" color scheme. The transparent aquamarine
color used for Insecticon's wings works quite well as a contrast color--
I wish there was a little bit more of it on the figure. The bits of dull
gold and gunmetal gray paint are fit in with the overall look of the figure
quite well where they're used, though I wish there was a bit more of it
on the legs, which are completely undetailed in terms of paint.

    Insecticon's robot mode
was not shown in the movie at all, and I doubt it was really conceived
of at the time-- namely because Insecticon's robot mode seems like a bit
of an afterthought compared to his beast mode. His robot mode is essentially
his insect mode with a head flip two of the insect legs forming the robot
legs while the other four legs form lanky pincer-like arms. His actual
transformation is SLIGHTLY more than that, but not by much-- he's definitely
one of the simplest scouts to transform in recent years. My feelings are
a bit mixed when it comes to this mode. On the one hand, it does work well
for the character-- the robot face is very much like a slightly more "humanized"
insect face, and the red eyes go quite well with the silver mandibles on
the lower half of the face. The wings fan out quite nicely behind the robot
mode, and having four arms does work well with an insect character. The
insect head also forms a decent enough chest, and certainly fits in better
in this mode than the robot head did in insect mode. However, it really
is barely different from the insect mode at all. I also think that the
arms should be a bit more obviously-- well-- arms, and not just the long
insect legs positioned around his shoulders. One more minor thing I think
subtracts a bit from this mode is that almost none of his paint apps are
visible in this mode-- there are some on the face, but it really shows
how unpainted this toy is, despite all the awesome mold detailing. As far
as articulation, Insecticon's movement pretty awesome-- he can move at
the base of the wings as well as two places at the base of his shoulders;
two additional spots on each individual upper arm; one spot on each elbow;
at the hips (at two spots); at the knees; at the ankles; and at the neck.
(In insect mode it's the same, except with the articulation of his legs
being the articulation of his front two legs; also his insect mode head
can only move up-and-down, not side-to-side, though the sets of two mandibles
on each side of his head can move up and down independently, as well.)

    Autobot Alliance Insecticon
has an excellent beast mode that recreates his onscreen presence quite
well, but his two modes are far too similar for my liking, and the lack
of paint detailing hurts him a bit in robot mode. Not a bad figure by any
means, but I just wish his transformation (and robot mode) had a bit more
to it.

      Insecticon has teamed up with Ravage
to hunt and destroy Autobots before, but never with as much satisfaction
as he feels this time. Bumblebee has been an annoyance to them both. It
will be a pleasure to sink his pincers into the soft internal wiring of
the Autobot warrior.
