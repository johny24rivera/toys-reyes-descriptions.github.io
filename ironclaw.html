    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Oil Slick. For

     Iron Claw is primarily
black, which-- by itself-- would pretty boring. Fortunately, the dull metallic
purple windows in vehicle mode help break things up a bit while still keeping
that mode "stealthy-looking" and "evil". (Which is odd, since his packaging
lists him as an Autobot, even though the toy itself only has Minicon symbols
on it-- he looks MUCH more like a Decepticon ally to me.) In robot mode,
Iron Claw gains a bit of a "G2" vibe, with his chest and upper legs painted
in a light seafoam green. If this color were more than an accent color,
it'd be rather obnoxious-- but used in just the right amounts seen here,
it serves as a really nice contrast color against the black and gives him
a bit more individuality. His head also has some paint app colors used
almost nowhere else on the figure-- namely, a metallic gunmetal gray "helmet/visor"
bit on his upper head, with his face painted metallic bronze. Both are
excellent colors and help to highlight the features of Iron Claw's face.
This said, however, adding a gold or metallic gunmetal paint app or two
elsewhere on Iron Claw's chassis-- like his claws or the front section
of his car mode (beyond the bronze headlights)-- would have really made
him pop.

     Iron Claw is an excellent
repaint of one of the best Minicon molds to come out of the "Classics"
line, and the seafoam green helps to differentiate his modes a bit more.
I wish he had another paint app or two in vehicle mode, but otherwise this
is an ace redeco that I'd highly recommend picking up if you can find it
for a decent price-- particularly if you don't have another version of
this mold. (And even if you do, I consider this the one with the best color
scheme.)
