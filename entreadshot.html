    Treadshot's vehicle mode
is a jet-- which really makes you wonder why his name is Treadshot. Anyways,
this mode is generally pretty darn good. Proportions are right-on, the
mold and paint detailing are pretty good, and little robot extras poke
through. The only noticeable extras are his robot hands, which stick out
a bit underneath the jet. They aren't cumbersome by any means, and don't
really detract much overall from the sleek look of the jet, like they did
with, say,
    <a href="enstarscream.html">
     Energon Starscream
    </a>
    , but they
are noticeable, so it's worth noting. Some of the detailing in this mode
helps spice up what would otherwise be "just another Transformer jet".
The cockpit is clear blue plastic, and shows a little seat and control
panel inside-- quite a feat for a basic-sized figure. He also has three
retractable landing gear, though they don't have movable wheels on them.
The yellow painted lines scattered through Treadshot's main body also help
draw attention to the figure. Overall, this mode looks pretty nice. However...
I'm not particularly fond of his Energon weapons. They're too long in comparison
to the jet, and there's a long flat connector piece, used in the gestalt
form, that doesn't really connect to anywhere in this mode. It's odd, since
this is first time in forever that Hasbro has included an accessory with
a brand new Transformer that can't be stored somewhere in its alternate
mode that's out of the way. The only place I can find for it is to connect
it on top of one of Treadshot's Energon weapons, but it still looks pretty
goofy this way, and definitely takes away from Treadshot's otherwise symmetrical
form. It's really my major beef with the toy in general; surely there would
have been a more inconspicious way to attach such a flat part on the vehicle
mode.

    Treadshot's robot mode
is also top-notch. There are no vehicle mode extras at all that don't complement
the mode in some way, and Treadshot's proportions are excellent. His articulation
is also superb; he can move at pretty much any major joint except the waist,
and most of these joints are ball joints, allowing for an even wider range
of articulation. His head mold isn't particularly exciting-- it was a rather
typical design for a G1 Autobot, actually-- but it is by no means ugly,
either. (Though perhaps the optics should be a little smaller. They do
have that neat light piping effect, however.) Again, though, those darn
Energon weapons are the main downside of this mode. If you keep the guns
flat, they interfere with elbow articulation, and that darned flat connector
piece I mentioned earlier still sticks out like a sore thumb, as it can't
be stored effectively in Treadshot's robot mode, either. I prefer to fold
up the back ends of the guns to allow easier arm movement, though admittedly
this does look a tad weird. Treadshot's Autobot spark crystal is on his
upper back in this mode. Oddly enough, Treadshot is one of the very few
Energon Transformers that doesn't have any Powerlinx or Minicon ports anywhere.

    According to his instructions,
Treadshot forms
    <a href="enstormjet.html">

    right arm,
though if you use the "leg" transformation given in his mold-mate
    <a href="enwindrazor.html">
     Windrazor's
    </a>
    instructions, you can make him any appendage on the gestalt that you want.

    Treadshot's core form
is pretty near perfect-- the only noticeable downside are his visible arms
in vehicle mode. Those darn Energon weapons can be rather annoying in both
modes, though, and drag his score down more than anything else. In fact,
if it weren't for the fact that they're needed for the gestalt form, I'd
have thrown them away after I got them. Still, Treadshot is an excellent
figure overall, and worth adding to your collection, especially if you
like gestalts.
