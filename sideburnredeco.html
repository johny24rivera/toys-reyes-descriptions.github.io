    Mold History
   </b>
   : Side Burn was a completely
new mold created for Car Robots (which subsequently became Robots in Disguise).

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe Side
Burn. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
deluxe Side Burn

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "Super" Side Burn's color
scheme follows a very simple formula: take the original deluxe Side Burn's
color scheme, replace the blues with reds, and the silvers with golds.
Add a few touches here and there, and you're pretty much done. So, "Super"
Side Burn is pretty much a more vibrant, fiery version of his former self.
I think this actually suits Side Burn's rebellious character on the show.
The gold tires and engine look pretty darn cool, too. What's really cool
about this Transformer, though, is that it's the first (at least to my
knowledge) Transformer with an "official licensed" vehicle mode! Right
on the package, it identifies Side Burn as a "Dodge Viper GTS", with the
little logo and everything! Side Burn also has a small Dodge Viper GTS
logo on his front bumper, which is really cool too.

     No mold changes have
been made to this toy from its previous release, so it retains all the
features and flaws of its predecessor in that respect.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     I like this version
of deluxe Side Burn a little better than the previous incarnation of him,
due to the more fitting color scheme, as well as the Dodge symbol on the
front, which is just cool!

       Side Burn makes the most of his advanced
speed and acceleration by chasing enemies until their circuits blow a fuse.
he can even warp short distances on the highway. he loves to go rocketing
down long, straight roads just to see how fast he can go. But he doesn't
take unnecessary risks because he knows his speed is important in the fight
against Megatron.
