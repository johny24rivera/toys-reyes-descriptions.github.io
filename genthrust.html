    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For

     ? That's okay, Hasbro's released him at mass retail anyways!
Well, not exactly. Although this toy's certainly another "update" of G1
Thrust, he's still definitely different. First, let's get to the downside--
the color scheme. Although his rusty brownish red is a nice, milky, semi-metallic
shade that's pretty accurate to the G1 toy, I'm not a fan of the really
blah greyish brown. Black just contrasts much better-- though granted,
black was used on Botcon 2007 Thrust, so I guess I understand why they
went this route. Having both of Thrust's major colors be dull, rusty earthy
shades doesn't provide for a whole lot of excitement, however. The yellow
cockpit does help to spice up the colors a little, though, as do the white
stripes on the wings and the bits of silver, light gray, and dull gold
used for some paint apps in robot mode. It doesn't look AS good as all
the neat paint apps on Botcon 2007 Thrust, however-- that guy popped visually
in robot mode.

     Alright, now for the
good part-- as opposed to Botcon 2007 Thrust, whose new wings were undersized
and a bit goofy-looking, this version of Thrust has more proportional remolded
wings-- both the main wings and rear stabilizers, to boot. They are long
and skinny, however, and they're NOT made of a remotely bendy kind of plastic,
which means they could snap a bit easier than the parts on most TFs-- just
a slight heads up when it comes to young 'uns. They also stick out quite
a bit in robot mode, moreso than the other various Classics Starscream
molds' wings do. Thrust also has turbine pieces which can be attached to
either his main wings or the underside of his rear stabilizers, though
in vehicle mode that's totally nonsensical-- it's definitely made to attach
there just for robot mode. I kinda wish the turbines were actually molded
INTO the main wings, but that's a small quibble. On a minor note, yes,
compared to Starscream he does have the remolded
     <a href="clasramjet.html">

     head, in case for some reason you thought he would turn out
differently there. He does have Classic Starscream's missile launchers,
however.

     Generations Thrust has
some nifty wings-- even if they're a bit TOO long and skinny-- and definitely
outdoes his Botcon 2007 version in terms of neat remolding. However, Generations
Thrust has an outright dull color scheme, with a few paint apps providing
the only real contrast in his color scheme-- the Botcon 2007 Thrust toy
is definitely better in that respect, so overall I'd give a SLIGHT edge
to Botcon Thrust in terms of which is the better toy. Of course, Botcon
Thrust also fetches MUCH higher prices, so there ya go.

       Thrust was great to have around during
the early days of the war, when the Decepticons won victory after victory.
His thundering engines and shouted threats terrified the few Autobots that
stood against them. It wasn't until later, when the Autobots got organized
enough to put up a real fight, that Thrust began screaming like an alpha
unit and fleeing at the first sign of danger.
