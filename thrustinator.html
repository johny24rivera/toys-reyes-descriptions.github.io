    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Waspinator toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Beast Wars Waspinator toy

     Thrustinator sure is
a blast from the past! This mold hasn't been used since the
     <a href="10thwaspinator.html">
      2006
"10th Anniversary" Edition,
     </a>
     and even then... well, this is half a new
mold-- at least for an American audience. This toy is basically half "normal"
Waspinator and half "meched-up" wasp-- nearly all of the new details are
taken from the Japanese Beast Wars "cyborg" Dirgegun. Basically, the mold
differences are: 1. More technological wings, with miniature fans detailed
on the inside and a sharp, knife-like look to them overall; 2. The left
half of the beast face has been changed to look very cyborg-esque in appearance,
with very mecahnical details and even a bar across the "eye", along with
a sharp metal mandible; 3. The blaster has been changed to have more mechanical
detailing; 4. There's a large gun now on the upper back which can be rotated
forward to hold one and spring-launch of the two missiles (still stored
in the bottom of each wing); 5. The middle of the robot chest now has mechanized
detail, with the Mutant head "flip feature" removed; 6. The left upper
leg has mechanized detail on it; 7. The right lower leg has sharpened,
mechanized details on it. It makes for a pretty incongruous figure, which
is why it was such an incredibly GENIUS move by FunPub to take this mold
and make it half-Thrust, half-Waspinator, as a post-Beast Machines body
for the character (which is a MUCH better idea than the weird wasp-with-Thrust-head
appearance he had at the end of the show). The Waspinator parts of this
toy are colored largely how you'd expect, looking fairly similar to his
10th Anniversary Edition, but with the green plastic a bit lighter and
more milkier. This actually works, as it provides a slightly better contrast
against the other colors now, and it looks close enough to still be show-accurate
as well. There's no yellow plastic either, with all of the yellow painted
on (mostly on the stripes on the abdomen), and some minor bits of the yellow
replaced with either more green plastic or a bit of light milky gray. The
light milky gray is rather bland, but is used very sparsely, and honestly
makes a little more sense since Thrustinator is more "mechanized" than
Waspy. He's got normal silver fists, as well as a yellow eye now for his
normal bug face to help it "mesh" with the Thrust colors better. Unfortunately
there's no paint at all on his normal wasp "back leg/robot foot", which
I suppose is understandable given all the other paint on him, but is still
a bummer. The mechanized Thrust parts are mostly a fairly light fuchsia--
it's a pretty good plastic color and goes quite well with the yellow paint
used on the gun, abdomen, and wasp head. Less so with the green, but they're
supposed to sort of clash a bit, that's the point of the toy. I do wish
the fuchsia plastic blended better with the fuchsia paint on the wings
and head, though, as the latter is a noticeably darker, more metallic shade
of the color. I do love the smoky gray plastic used on the wings, helping
to blend in the mechanical details with the semi-translucent nature of
wasp wings (and it fits the color scheme well, too). There's also tons
of silver and yellow details on the fuchsia parts to really bring out all
that mold detail on the "new" parts, which all looks great.

     Beyond the Dirgegun
mold changes, Thrustinator has a new headsculpt, which is incredibly well-detailed
and sculpted, and a perfect amalgam of Waspinator's and Thrust's heads.
It looks really messed up, which it well should. The bug eye on the left,
the Thrust eye on the right, the mandible on the right, the Thrust vent
on the left, the central head vent with the bug antennae on the sides of
it-- it all looks so wonderfully ugly. My only issue here is that the detailing
on the back half of the head was clearly meant to be painted with some
stripes of Thrust-y fuchsia, but was kept unpainted green for whatever
reason, which is a bummer. Also, although not a mold change, many of the
ball joints are noticeably looser on this toy than on my various previous
copies of the Waspinator mold-- kinda annoying, but nothing some floor
polish can't fix.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Thrustinator is just
an absolutely ingenious move by FunPub, all the more ingenious given that
all the "cyborg" molding from Dirgegun actually fits THIS idea better than
it did the original toy in Japan! The fusing of the two color schemes--
and the character itself-- is brilliant, and that wonderful headsculpt
is the cherry on top. Although the mold may not be all that great by modern
standards, the concept is just amazing, and this is one of my favorite
Club exclusives of all time (and definitely my favorite concept from among
the subscription service 2.0 figures).

       Vehicon Thrust and Predacon Waspinator
were once two owners of the same spark. After the Battle for the Sparks
of Cybertron, the two identities were merged to more or less form a single
individual: Thrustinator. Shortly after this reformatting he was flung
through the multiverse and landed in Axiom Nexus where he encountered his
new partner, Heinrad.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Heinrad constantly talks about time,
possible time, anti-time, looped time, inverse time... All of this gives
Thrustinator a headache. Add in the nebulous stretches of the multiverse
and it's a full-blown migraine. For a while, he had tried to follow along,
but he soon realized that he had no idea what the time traveler was talking
about. All Thrustinator knows is that he can't go home until he and Heinrad
fix the past and prevent a catastrophe. He wishes they'd just hurry up
and fix it already.
