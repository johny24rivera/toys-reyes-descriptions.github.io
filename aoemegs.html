    Can't have a movie line
without a Megatron, now, can we-- even if he's been upgraded to
    <a href="aoegalvatron.html">
     Galvatron
    </a>
    !
This "throwback" 1-step changer is based off the
    <a href="rotfvoymegs.html">
     RotF
version
    </a>
    of Megatron, whose alt mode is an alien tank-thing with some
jet boosters in the back, though the jet aspects of him have been de-emphasized
in this toy, making him look more like an alien tank instead. Most of the
details and proportions are fairly accurate in this mode; he's got angled
treads, rounded areas around his main gun emplacement which isn't quite
a turret but looks like it almost could be-- as well as the signature odd
"robot head behind a mask in between the front treads" bit. There are two
noticeable downsides to this version, though. The first is that, from the
back end, Megatron looks a bit weak. He's got an extra set of treads that
are obviously his robot legs, and there's a noticeable gap in said back
end as well. Secondly, because of the transformation and because RotF Megatron's
right arm is noticeably larger than his left, the shoulder "bump" on the
right tread is definitely larger than the one on the left and a fairly
obvious extra. On a bit of a lesser note, if you look at him from a direct-on
side view in this mode, a gap down the middle is quite noticeable, as there's
some definite space in between the bottom-- which forms his robot chest,
arms, and the like-- and the top of the tank mode. That said, from the
vast majority of angles you can't see this, so this is a minor quibble.
The color scheme doesn't really change anything about RotF Megs' typical
colors, for the most part-- he's still largely that very blah light milky
gray plastic that just looks boring, though the very dark brown and dark
metallic gunmetal gray paint used on his treads is a pretty good shade
and helps provide some contrast, albeit not much color. He's also got some
darker gray for the main gun, but again, it doesn't add much. There's also
a bit of tan near the front in front of his robot head, which adds perhaps
a LITTLE color, but not a lot. Then again, this IS all accurate to his
RotF version, so I can't complain too much about his lack of color. The
most impressive part about this mode is all the mold detailing-- whether
it's the incredible amount of intricate detailing on the treads, the ridges
on the cannon, or the curved bits on the top, this mode is covered in excellent
molded detail.

    To transform Megatron
to robot mode, you simply press down on the little dark gray lever on the
top of his tank mode and he auto-converts. (To change him back, you just
move everything back to its vehicle mode position until it clicks into
place.) Some 1-step changers have pretty impressive and fun transformations,
but unfortunately that's not the case for Megatron. Basically the back
"tank parts" rotate back to reveal his arms and legs a bit more, while
his robot head tilts forward some. It's pretty darned clear that his entire
tank mode is on his back in this mode, which makes for one heck of a piece
of kibble-- thankfully his feet are wide and solid, so there's no stability
issues, at least. Still, this mode definitely plays second-fiddle to the
tank mode. The legs and the chest are the only things that look solid (though
the chest is just a tad small proportionally); the arms are a bit too stiff
and wide, and suffer from being on the same "plane" as the treads on Megatron's
upper shoulders and hanging out way to the sides of his butt. The robot
head also has the sides of the mask stil in front of it-- albeit separated
a little on the sides-- and the turret sticking straight up out of his
upper back certainly isn't movie-accurate. At least Megatron's mold detailing
is still quite intricate, complete with the odd dangly claws for hands
and the asymmetrical shoulders. There's also plenty of the "fragmented
metal" look on his chest, all of which is painted silver (along with his
upper legs and knees), which is certainly a nice change from all the light
milky gray plastic. The head is sculpted a little oddly, though, with the
grin a bit TOO wide. The bronze face also doesn't look quite right-- there's
a bit too much of said color where there shouldn't be, like around his
light red eyes. As for articulation, Megatron can move back-and-forth at
each shoulder-- as is the case with pretty much every one-step changer,
he can't move much.

    The AoE 1-step Megatron
toy is one of those toys I'm just unsure why it exists. There were plenty
of cool KSI Decepticon designs in the movie that never got a toy, but instead
we get a 1-step toy of a Megatron design we're already gotten tons of toys
of? The tank mode is fairly accurate, and the mold detailing is impressive
for a 1-stepper, but the transformation-- usually the highlight for these
toys-- is pretty unimpressive, and his robot mode has his entire alt mode
hanging off the back, along with a few more minor oddities. If you want
an easy-to-transform version of this design, I'd go for the
    <a href="aaactmegatron.html">
     "Autobot
Alliance" Activator
    </a>
    -- even if the latter has an inferior color scheme,
it has considerably better articulation and moderately better proportions.
