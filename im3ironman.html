    Iron Man's "Battle Charger"
toy for his third movie is a rather snazzy, slightly futuristic-looking
sportscar. For the most part the proportions are pretty good in this mode,
though the roof could stand to be a bit taller in comparison to the surrounding
parts and the back bumper is a tad overly large. There isn't any mech mode
extras in this mode either, which is a big bonus. I love all the details
on this car in places you wouldn't expect-- there's angular, "spine-ridge"
like lines going across most of the back half of this vehicle that bring
to mind Iron Man's suit, along with vents on the front end and other various
mechanical detailing along the ridges. The color scheme is typical Iron
Man, though the gold is a tad lighter and the red a tad darker than usual--
they're both metallic shades (either of paint or of plastic), however,
so it still looks great. Adding up all the stripes, the windows, and the
spoiler, Iron Man has a pretty good number of paint apps as well to keep
most parts from getting too one-tone. (That said, painting the headlights
and/or taillights would've helped).

    As part of the "Battle
Charger" gimmick, if you wind Iron Man back and let him go on a flat surface
he'll automatically stand up and transform into mech mode a few seconds
later. It's admittedly cool the first time or two, but it would've been
a lot cooler if the mech mode looked more impressive. The hands are merely
molded onto the underside of the car doors and have zero articulation (you
can technically push them inwards, but they spring right back out to their
default position as soon as you let go of them). The legs-- though painted
individually so you can make them out easier-- are also one big block of
a "uni-leg", leading down to what essentially the back third of the car
mode serving as his "feet"-- and I use this term only in the loosest sense,
as there really isn't much of an attempt to make them look like feet at
all here. The chest flap made out of the front bumper also sticks out way
too far and is too large proportionally, though the white paint app in
the middle does a decent job of looking like Iron Man's "power core" for
his suit. His waist/hips and head have some pretty spot-on paint detailing
and sculpting, however, so at least he looks good there. The two molded-in
shoulder cannons are also a nice touch, giving him some firepower in this
mode.

    Iron Man's "Battle Charger"
toy has a pretty darned nice vehicle mode, as well as a good number of
paint apps and a pretty decent color scheme. That said, his mech mode looks
incredibly awkward for the most part-- particularly at the "legs" and the
large chest flap. Add to this no articulation for the toy at all in either
mode, and I can't recommend this to any except the biggest Iron Man (or
Transformers Crossovers) fans, as the gimmick simply hampers the toy too
much. (I will say that I prefer this one over the
