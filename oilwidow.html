not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

        Really, I could have
taken my snapshots of
        <a href="uniblackarachnia.html">
         Universe Blackarachnia
        </a>
        ,
lessened the brightness, and posted them as Crystal Widow, and you wouldn't
be able to tell that I was fooling you. Crystal Widow and Blackarachnia
are THAT similar. They've got the same paint apps and colors, overall.
The ONLY difference between the two (besides the fact that one is an Autobot,
the other a Decepticon) is that Crystal Widow has a rather duller, oddly
pinkish orange in place of Blackarachnia's "normal" orange. That's it.
I mean, even for a Universe Exclusive, this is pathetic. I can't even recommend
this one to die-hard completists. If you're wondering whether to get just
Crystal Widow or Universe Blackarachnia, though, I'd go with Blackarachnia-
the orange on her is a little more appetizing that Crystal Widow's pinkish
orange.

        No mold changes have
been made to Crystal Widow. (Heck, they can't be bothered to even give
her a new set of colors, why would they give her a mold change?)

             Oil Slick is at least
different enough from Armada Sideswipe to warrant the usage of webspace
for pictures, but he's still a pretty lackluster Universe toy. His main
change is that the sky blue of Sideswipe has been replaced with nice shade
of purple. It does look a little better than the blue overall, but alas,
the designers couldn't be bothered to change any other colors on the toy.
So his paint apps and "inner robot parts" are the same as on Sideswipe.
(Well, the silver used for his bumpers in vehicle mode is of a slightly
darker shade, but it's not something you'd notice unless you deliberately
compared the two toys.) Oil Slick does have a little mold change from Sideswipe,
however- Sideswipe's Autobot symbol has been remolded into a Decepticon
symbol for Oil Slick. Which is appropriate, given the changes to his paint
job. However, given all the parts of his that are the same as Sideswipe's,
it's still just pretty much another lazy Universe exclusive. Yawn.

              The Crystal Widow vs.
Oil Slick "Battle in a Box" set is yet another lackluster Universe exclusive.
Crystal Widow is especially lazy, given that almost nothing has changed,
and Oil Slick fares little better, with basically just one major color
change and a remolding done to his allegiance symbol. Robot Drone is also
a joke, since he's the exact same as his predecessor Nightbeat. So unless
you don't have either of the previous versions of these molds, I'd skip
this box set, even if you're a completist. I mean, the paint jobs themselves
aren't bad, but they're barely different from their previous versions.
You wouldn't be getting much for $20.
