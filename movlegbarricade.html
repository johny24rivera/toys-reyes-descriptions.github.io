    Barricade's police car
mode is very nice, especially for a Legends-sized figure. Usually figues
of this size have to sacrifice something for the vehicle mode, but not
Barricade. His windows are unpainted, which rather irks me, but otherwise
this alt mode is flawless-- he's got rear and front bumpers, perfect proportions,
no robot extras, the works. He also has simplified versions of his police
emblems in the movie-- there's "Police" on the sides of his car doors and
his rear spoiler, but there's no Decepticon police emblem or "To Punish
and Enslave" motto imprinted on his side, alas. Still, you can only expect
so much from a $4 toy...

    Given that he has such
a perfect vehicle mode, you'd think Barricade's robot mode would look horrible
for a toy of this scale. Surprisingly, that's not the case. He's very simplified,
to be sure, but his proportions aren't too far off (even though his arms
and lower legs are rather flat if looked at from a certain angle), and
he has little vehicle kibble. The head sculpt is very well-done, and he
can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and ankles. However,
my biggest complaint about this figure is that, due to the rear bumper
of the vehicle mode not folding anywhere at all, Barricade's forward knee
movement is nonexistent-- thus, he's stuck in a permanent "ready" stance--
something emphasized more by the fact that his face looks a bit upward
from his chest when it's fully unfolded instead of straight outwards. Another,
lesser complaint is that his claw-hands are sculpted rather badly-- they
look more like sharp tulip bulbs than actual hands, and are almost completely
2-D in their sculpting.

    Barricade is one of
the better and more accurate Legends figures, with a near-perfect police
car mode and a decently proportioned robot mode. His odd hand sculpts and
the odd stance he's forced into in his robot mode are his major faults.
