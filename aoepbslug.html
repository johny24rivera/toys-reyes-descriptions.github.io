    With a couple of notable
exceptions, Slug's triceratops mode is done pretty well. Let's cover the
bad stuff first. The proportions are slightly off, for one-- not obnoxiously
so, but the main body isn't quite as bulky as it should be, and the triceratops
head just a titch small. There's also some really obvious robot extras--
namely, the lower arms and their attached weapons, which just hang below
the stomach and under the tail really obviously (made all the more obvious
by their light blue coloration). On a lesser note, the tops of the rear
legs are pretty obviously his robot feet, and the robot head is slightly
visible below the triceratops head, but only from a mostly side-on view.
The mold detailing-- while not QUITE as good as the

is still pretty darned good, with bone-like "armor" detailing all over
the place, particularly along his spine and the rather wicked-looking detailing
on his dino face. The color scheme sticks to Slug's AoE toy colors pretty
closely, with a dark bluish purple being the main color. There's also quite
a lot of silver paint-- on much of the face and horns (which looks pretty
darned awesome, if I do say so myself), shoulders, and the end of the tail
(though not the rest of it, oddly). The rest of the tail-- and some parts
that are more visible in robot mode-- is that darned blah light milky gray
I wish Hasbro would pretty much get rid of for good. It's sooo boring looking,
and should have been replaced with a more metallic-looking plastic. The
red apps on the crest-- and visible from the sides of the stomach-- also
help add some more color variation, and contrast well against the other
main colors. There's also the usual Autobot-blue optics (which are totally
not movie-accurate, it's worth noting-- but then again, neither are most
of Slug's other colors). For articulation in this mode, Slug can sadly
only "offically" move his tail up-and-down at the midpoint-- an unacceptable
lack of articulation for a dino mode, even given that that's not the focus
of this subline. You can also technically get his front legs to move back-and-forth
slightly at the shoulders, but this involves bending the pieces below his
stomach/his lower robot arms a bit, so I generally don't recommend it.

    Slug's transformation
is fairly straightforward-- you unfold his legs and lower arms, stand him
up, and crack his skull in half and rotate the halves to his shoulders.
Voila! Robot mode. The proportions in this mode are generally pretty good,
with a better-proportioned chest than his deluxe version, though I wish
the skull-halves sat a little higher and not as far back behind his arms
(though, to be fair, this would interfere with his gimmick). He also looks
a bit stiff, though this is more because of his limited articulation--
he can move at front-to-back and outwards at the hips, and front-and-back
at the shoulders, but that's it. I don't see why at least knee and/or head
articulation couldn't have been added. The mold detailing continues to
be quite good, with the ridged armor becoming a bit more refined for most
of his robot bits on his chest and upper legs. His robot headsculpt is
also spot-on, very much a round medieval knight helmet with a blue visor.
The paint is also still quite liberally applied to this mode, on the chest
and abdomen, shoulders, and head. The addition of metallic gunmetal gray
helps to vary up the color scheme more and provide a better alternative
to that light milky gray, though I'm not a fan of the light blue used for
his weapons and the oddly simplistically-sculpted hands they're permanently
attached to-- it sticks out a bit TOO much without other accenting on Slug's
body, and doesn't really fit with the rest of Slug's scheme. These light
blue parts are made of rubbery plastic, and are part of Slug's Power Battler
gimmick. Pull back-and-forth on Slug's tail behind his abdomen and his
arms will move up-and-down quickly-- given the mace and sword on the end
of each arm, this is the "Smash and Slash" the packaging talks about. It's
honestly a pretty fun little gimmick, even if it's not mind-blowing. It
also doesn't interfere with shoulder articulation as much as you'd think,
as you can still push them up-and-down manually, you'll just hear the click
of some internal ratchets (not breaking, just moving) as you do so.

    Slug is one of the better
Power Battler molds. Sure, he's got a few issues-- namely an unacceptable
lack of articulation in dino mode, as well as some obvious robot extras
in said mode, and his robot mode is a bit stiff-looking-- but his action
feature is pretty fun, he's got a good color scheme with a good amount
and variety of paint colors, and he looks accurate enough to the movie
design (colors aside) in both modes. If you're looking for a simpler-to-transform
version of AoE Slug, I'd go with this version.
