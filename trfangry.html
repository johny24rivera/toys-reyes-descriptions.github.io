    Fangry's robot mode is
based, interestingly enough, on his G1 toy's Headmaster Brisko's robot
mode. The arms are pretty normal-- with regular fists molded into the insides
of the arm pieces-- but the rest of the robot mode has pretty unique mold
detailing. The legs are covered with horizontal details making them look
almost like springs, he's got what looks like a belt with an oversized
rectangular buckle on his waist, and some weird teeth-like detailing on
his chest. His headsculpt is very unique, with side antennae, a large forehead,
a thin long visor, and a knight-like faceplate. Unfortunately, like most
Titan Masters this thing isn't covered in any paint at all in this mode--
you've just got black arms and a head with the rest in a dull dark magenta.
It's a shame because there's some cool details on there. Like all Titan
Masters, Fangry can move at the head, back-and-forth at the shoulders,
hips, and knees (the latter two as one, since the legs are pinned or molded
together). In head mode, Fangry looks like his G1 self's head, which is
more of your average "late G1" head where a lot of 'em look alike. He's
got side antennae, a V-shaped central forehead crest, and then the usual
thick visor with a regular mouth. What is unique about Fangry's head, though,
is the nice moderately light green used for the visor and face-- it looks
really good against the black; I wish it was used elsewhere on the figure.
The magenta legs that make up the back of the head look a bit odd considering
the rest of the head is black, though.

    The accessory's first
mode is basically Fangry's G1 alt mode-- a black two-legged wolf with magenta
wings and body. Unfortunately there isn't really any other paint in this
mode beyond the yellow eyes. The Titan Master slots right into the middle
of the body in a rather ingenious manner, so I really like that it makes
up a good portion of this mode rather than just "riding it". The proportions
in this mode are quite solid, and the detailing is about half-organic and
half-technological, oddly enough-- the pelvis has some horizontal robotic
detailing, as do the sides of the chest and the appendages, but the wings
and wolf head look very organic. Granted, this is the way it was on the
G1 toy, but it's still quite odd. Fangry also has a large and fat (but
short) tail, and unfortunately the dragon head for his other main mode
just kinda sits behind his back in this mode, sticking out a little. For
articulation in this mode the head can move down a bit, the legs forward
and back (as one at the hips), back and forth at the tail, and each arm
can move separately at the elbows. The wings can also move forward slightly.
Overall this is pretty good articulation, though I wish the legs could
move separately.

    The accessory's second
mode is the wolf mode down on all fours with the dragon head folded out
and the wolf head folded away, while the Titan Master is taken out of the
body and now rides this mode on the back. Overall this is a bit underwhelming
for a second mode, given how similar it is to the first-- nearly all of
the same details and such are visible here, with the exception of the head
switch. The articulation's the same, too. The new dragon head looks more
robotic than the wolf head, with a "calm but evil-looking" expression molded
onto its maw. There's some yellow paint again on the eyes and some gray
on the neck scales, but that's it as far as paint. There's also a huge
unsightly peg sticking out of the front of the neck, a side effect of the
weapon mode. There's two small tabs to sort of "guide" the Titan Master
into his seat atop the hollow body of the dragon, but unfortunately it's
not nearly as solid as if there were some pegs for the feet to slot into--
he can move around rather easily in his seat atop the dragon.

    The weapon mode is the
wolf mode but with the Titan Master taken out, the wolf mode and wings
folded in/up, and oriented with the legs and tail pointing forward. Like
most of the Titan Master set weapon modes, it's pretty weak. The only thing
that really says it's a "weapon" are the cannon-like holes in the bottom
of the tail and the feet. Otherwise it looks like... well, a winged monster
with its feet and tail pointed at you. Like many of these "weapon modes",
it's best forgotten about.

    Titans Return Fangry
is a disappointment if you wanted a genuine deluxe upgrade of the G1 character.
The Titan Master and head modes have some really nice detailing, and the
winged wolf mode is a nice callback and is quite well-done and fairly articulated
for the size. Unfortunately, when it comes to aspects of this toy that
AREN'T G1 Fangry-related, it falls flat or is just kinda boring. The dragon
mode is decent, but it's too same-ish when compared with the winged wolf
mode, and the weapon mode is just... bad. Honestly though, if you want
a new version of Fangry this is your only chance as of this writing (3/20),
and despite some issues it's still an above-average Titan Master set overall.
