    Unlike most of the Beast
Hunters versions of previous Prime characters, Airachnid's Cyberverse Beast
Hunters debut is a smaller version of her usual design, with no extra spikes
or other design elements added. Thus, her vehicle mode is a fairly small
helicopter, and in terms of the general "construction" of the mode and
proportions, it's pretty darned close to her
    <a href="airachnid.html">
     deluxe
version
    </a>
    . That is, there's fairly minimal mold detailing here, even
for a toy with the Prime design aesthetic, and the design is overall fairly
simplistic, with no landing gear or the like molded into the bottom. Her
propellers are also molded to look a bit like her extra "spider legs",
though in this mode this means that they looks a bit overly spiky for propellers
(in other words, those parts, at least, fit right in with the Beast Hunters
aesthetic!). They also spin quite freely, so that's a plus. There's also
some minor robot mode extras visible, mostly because of the paint detailing
on them; the feet are rather obvious on the back end, as well as her obvious
gold kneecaps further up the helicopter tail. Her purple waist is also
technically visible if you look at the toy from or an angle that's straight-on
or at a view looking up at the vehicle, but this isn't visible from any
normal angle so I don't count it as a bonafide robot "extra" in this case.
Other than the aformentioned gold and purple paint apps that make some
robot parts stick out, this mode is very very monochrome, being almost
entirely black. There's some silver paint on the windows, but they aren't
of a shade that really works as a great accent color that makes the toy
pop or anything. Airachnid's weapon is the bow weapon that comes with many
other Beast Hunters Legion-class figures, and in this mode she has three
ports that it can plug into; one on each side (a little below the back
end of the painted windows) and one on the underside of the nose.

    Airachnid's transformation
is also remarkably similar to her deluxe-class figure, with the only major
differences being that her nosecone simply folds back behind to reveal
her head and that the two side sections of the 'copter mode simply fold
back to allow her arms to fold out. Interestingly enough, in some respects
this tiny toy actually looks BETTER than her deluxe version; her arms are
much more proportional and-- though still a bit two-dimensional-- look
much more like her actual show-model arms than on her deluxe. Her legs
also aren't quite as 2-D, either. However, she still has the issue of a
pretty obvious section of her vehicle mode just sitting behind her head,
which looks pretty unsightly. Unlike her deluxe version, this toy's propellers
can't fold around her body to look more like her extra spider appendages,
but
at this scale this can't be realistically expected, and it's not like that
did much on the deluxe toy anyway. She does have the top of the helicopter
on her back, but it fits in with her overall silhouette at nearly every
angle and doesn't get in the way of articulation, so I don't mind it. Her
paint apps also come out a bit more in this mode; she's still mostly black,
to be sure, but a nice dark metallic shade of purple on her lower arms
and waist becomes obvious, as does some gold, silver, and red on her well-done
face sculpt. (The mold detailing on her robot parts is also quite well-done
for the size, and at least give her a little bit of intricate detailing
on her toy.) Airachnid can move at the shoulders (at two points; one only
slight), hips, and limited back-and-forth motion at the hips-- slightly
below-average even for a Legion toy, and I wish her knees could bend back
a bit further. She also has tiny feet-- which is show-accurate, but makes
her a little hard to stand up if she's not in a "standard" pose. As you'd
expect, Airachnid can hold her crossbow in either of her hands, though
the side ports from helicopter mode are now on her shoulders and work pretty
well, too.

    Cyberverse Airachnid
is, surprisingly enough, overall a BETTER toy than her deluxe version,
especially when you take her smaller size into account. She still certainly
has her share of issues-- some obvious robot bits in her bare-bones vehicle
mode, somewhat 2-D legs, a blatantly obvious section of vehicle kibble
behind her robot head-- but the deluxe version shares these issues and
a few more to boot. She looks better-proportioned, certainly has better
arms, and a pretty fitting weapon to boot (even if it wasn't made specifically
for her). In every way except articulation, this is superior to the deluxe
version, and unless you're a scale stickler, I'd go for this one over the
deluxe if you want a toy of the character.
