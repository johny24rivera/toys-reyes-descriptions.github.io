    Prowl's alternate mode
is an Acura RSX police car. And boy, I tell ya, if ANY Alternator is an
updated version of their G1 self, it's Prowl. It's definitely a modern
car alright, due to the sleekness of the design and even the angled hood
sirens, but otherwise it looks like a carbon copy of
    <a href="g1prowl.html">
     G1
Prowl
    </a>
    . Same exact color scheme, same paint apps, same "Highway Patrol:
POLICE" signs on the car doors, same police badges on the side doors and
front hood. In fact, in one respect I think it's TOO reminscent of G1 Prowl--
the Autobot symbol on the hood, though G1-accurate, needs to go. Although
it would be fine on a mainline toy, it kinda ruins the super-realism the
Alternators have going for them. But that's a small complaint. The rest
of the mode is perfect, as you'd expect from an Alternator; no robot extras
except for the feet which are a bit visible under the openable rear window,
very nice realistic detailing, openable trunk, fold-down seats, movable
steering wheel, opening car doors, and all the good stuff Alternators are
known for.

    Prowl's robot mode,
however, is slightly sub-par for an Alternator. The arms are rather puny
in comparison to the rest of the body, and it's hard to keep them from
popping off while transforming the toy during a certain complicated step.
There's also a noticeable gap between Prowl's (excellently sculpted) head
and his car hood-chest. And although I like his leg construction, he knee
articulation is severely limited, almost non-existent, and his upper legs
are way too small when compared to his lower legs. On the plus side, though,
Prowl's got some pretty cool mechanical details on his legs, and he also
has great articulation in the arms and even ball-joint ankle articulation.
He also has TWO weapons-- an engine-gun AND a really cool nightstick, which
is perfect for a police car Transformer, of course. He also has few car
extras that don't accent the look of the robot mode.

    Prowl's robot mode has
a few proportions and articulation problems, making him a slightly below-average
Alternator, but he has a superb vehicle mode that's a big G1 nod, excellent
sculpting, and little non-accentuating extras in either mode. Recommended
if you're a bit realistic alt mode fan, though there's several other Alts
that probably deserve your money first.
