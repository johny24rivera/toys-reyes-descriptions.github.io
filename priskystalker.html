    Skystalker's dragon mode
is more of a traditional dragon, with viking-style horns, four legs, two
wings, and the like. First off, there's no obvious robot mode extras in
this mode at all-- always a plus. Proportionally the emphasis on Skystalker
here is with his wings-- they're proportionally about as large as you'd
expect, though considering most of the winged Predacons have wings a little
SMALLER than you'd expect, this comes across as him having large wings.
Skystalker's proportions for his body are a bit more lanky and skinny when
compared to the other Prime Predacons, but he also comes across as quite
hard-edged, with spikes along his tail and sharp angles on places like
his legs. His front claws look particularly sharp and deadly. His wings
also look like frozen blades, as opposed to "full" wings, which works quite
well given his whole "theme". The dragon head is particularly fierce and
evil-looking, and yes, the jaw can open and close on the mouth, revealing
jagged teeth. Skystalker's other articulation in this mode is at his neck
(at two points), his shoulders (at two points), his front knees (at two
points), front ankles (at two points), hips (at two points), rear knees
(at two points), rear ankles, at the base of each wing at two points, and
at the base of the tail (at two points). Other than another joint or two
on his tail, Skystalker thus has all the articulation you could reasonably
expect in this mode, and though his appendages are skinny, they're well-balanced,
so he can pull off some pretty nice poses. Skystalker's color scheme is
pretty darned awesome, and immediately invokes an "ice dragon" look, to
contrast with
    <a href="pripredaking.html">
     Predaking's
    </a>
    "fire dragon"
look. The main shades of moderately dark icy blue and a pale blue that
is mixed with white works well, as do the white accents-- it all screams
"arctic", particularly in combination with his mold detailing. There's
also a nice white spray "fade" along the top of his tail. In addition,
there's a tad of yellow as an accent color, which contrasts well against
the blue while not being so prevalent that this "warm" color begins to
break apart Skystalker's "icy" look. That said, the yellow paint is a bit
too thin-- the darker blue behind it can "bleed" through a little, which
is unfortunate. Skystalker's gimmick looks like it was intended to be more
intricate than it is, but was partially cut for budget reasons; by pressing
forward on the jagged middle section in front of the white disc on each
wing, you can send the disc flying a little via a push launcher, but it
seems that they were originally intended to have a more intricate, better
method of launching. It's an okay gimmick, but a more involved one would
have been cooler.

    Skystalker's robot mode,
unfortunately, is the mode that took the hit for his excellent beast mode.
Other Prime Predacons usually have a bit more to them, but Skystalker's
transformation is very much a "stand me up and reveal my head" transformation.
There isn't even a headswap-- though I don't mind the robot head coming
out of the dragon mouth. In fact, in concept, it's a cool idea, but a bit
too much of the dragon head is still showing, with the jaw extending down
into his chest looking rather odd. His skinny appendages also definitely
don't help him in this mode-- it's definitely not impossible, but he can
be a bit tricky to balance, given that his legs can't straighten out completely
and his large wing disc launchers and tail collapsed against his back make
him considerably back-heavy in this mode. Granted, small heels fold out,
but those don't help much. His arms are his dragon front legs, but here
I think there's a rather ingenious "hand switch" that gives him robot hands
that can hold compatible weapons and the like while also keeping those
hands pretty well-hidden in dragon mode, even though it's a simple rotation
that changes up his hands. The mold detailing and colors that show up more
in this mode aren't much, given how much his two modes share, but the metallic
light silvery blue stripes on his chest go great against the darker blue
behind him, and the addition of a semi-metallic white paint on his feet
and hips looks quite nice. His robot mold detailing is a bit more ornamental,
as is the norm for Prime Predacons, and looks like scaled armor-- the exception
being the nifty addition of fans on the sides of his upper legs, which
adds even more to his "cold" persona. I'm not a fan of Skystalker's headsculpt,
though-- it just looks weird, with the weird faceplate with two irregular
chunks sticking out of it. It's like they couldn't decide between insect-like
mandibles or a gas mask-style face. As it is, it just doesn't look like
a Predacon face, though it is detailed well. Skystalker's wings can swing
forward to launch discs in this mode, though they look a bit odd rotating
halfway up the wings as they do. He can also "wear" the spiked club of
his tail over one of his hands, but it's so small it's not really that
impressive of a weapon. Given how many parts he prominently shares in both
modes, Skystalker's articulation in this mode is pretty much the same as
in dragon mode, but with only one point of articulation at the neck now
and no movement at the wrists (formerly dragon ankles).

    Skystalker has a fantastic,
ice-themed dragon mode with some impressive detailingÂ  and a good
color scheme. However, his robot mode suffers greatly, with exceedingly
odd proportions, bad balance, and simply too much shared between both modes.
My least favorite of the Prime Predacon molds.

       Skystalker slides from the murky numbness
of his Hyperevolution Chamber and into the heat of battle. His Spark aches
to join the battle, but his instincts tell him to wait, to understand where
he is. Even as the battle between Smokescreen and Shockwave continues to
rage, he takes a moment to look around. He stands in a room full of unfamiliar
equipment-- a room he nonetheless recognizes as a laboratory. A laboratory
in which he-- and possibly other Predacons-- have been experimented on.
His cold, calculating mind is suddenly submerged in anger. His wings spread,
and a devastating barrage of white-hot discs fly, burning, blasting and
melting all around him.
