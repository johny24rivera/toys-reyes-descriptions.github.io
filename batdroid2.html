    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Battle
Droid. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     For its second release,
the AAT mold gets more subdued colors that look a bit more in-place in
the battlefield, particularly if that battlefield is a desert. The figure's
almost entirely tan this time around, which has its good points and its
bad points. FOr one thing, there's no need to worry about colors clashing,
and the deco is certainly realistic. Plus, unlike with the first release
of this mold, the mech parts and vehicle parts mesh much better asethetically
in mech mode.Â  On the other hand, having almost the entire figure
be variations on one color means that it's hardly eye-catching, and there
isn't much contrast overall. There are a few patches of other colors--
mainly the dull gray and silver on the lower legs and guns, and the red
optics look really striking against the tan-- but not enough, in my opinion.
Though the muddy brown does provide a fair amount of contrast against the
light tan.

     Whether I would recommend
the SWTF Battle Droid Commander to someone interested in a transforming
AAT depends on whether you like more realistic or more eye-catching schemes.
If you prefer something realistic and that meshes well in mech mode, get
this version. If you prefer something that visually pops and is more distinguishable
on a shelf, go with the original release.

       Battle droid commanders drive Armored
Assault tanks (AATs) onto the battlefield to fight the Republic forces.
The tanks are equipped with cannons and missile launchers, but these advanced
versions have an additional weapon: the battle droid commanders can quickly
change the tanks into enormous mechs that will easily overwhelm an opponent!
