    The packaging says that
Grimlock is a backhoe, but he's actually a construction excavator vehicle.
This mode looks pretty nice overall, with a very nice color scheme. Unlike
    <a href="heavyload.html">
     Heavy Load
    </a>
    and
    <a href="hightower.html">
     Hightower
    </a>
    ,
Grimlock does not have a "kiddy" look to him in his vehicle mode. It's
very well-balanced overall, and the shovel-arm is the perfect size. I especially
like the gold trim on the end of it. Grimlock can swerve his upper part
around 360 degrees in this mode as well, which is a very nice touch and
allows for some "poses" in vehicle mode. The thing that really bugs me
about this mode, however, is the fact that Grimlock's connector (used only
for combining into
    <a href="landfill.html">
     Landfill
    </a>
    ) sticks out rather
blatantly in between Grimlock's two treads. Speaking of the treads, the
tab that connects them to the main part doesn't hold them in that well,
so they can disconnect from the main part entirely too easily in this mode,
which is rather annoying. Not to mention that part of the robot feet are
clearly visible on the inside of the treads as well. The treads aren't
rubber, but making them such would be impossible due to the transformation.
So, there's just two little plastic wheels on the bottom of the treads
to move him around. It actually moves bettter than rubber treads would
have anyway, so I'm not complaining. The back of his robot head is also
a bit visible in the back part of the main part of the vehicle mode, but
this is rather minor. A rather neat secret for this mode not talked about
in the instructions is that, by pressing down on a small tab near the bottom
of Grimlock's shovel-arm, a "lower jaw" snaps out on a spring, which actually
makes the shovel-arm look a bit like some kind of mecha-dinosaur mouth.
A nice touch.

    Grimlock's robot mode
really doesn't look that good, and is even less playable than it looks.
For one, Grimlock's arms are articulated, but all in the wrong ways. There
isn't really any kind of arm pose you can get him in that looks normal.
He almost always looks like he's some kind of weird praying mantis, the
way his arms are positioned. His arms are also rather asymmetrical, and
not in a good way- one of his lower arms is transparent and slightly larger
than the other way. Originally, such in
    <a href="xbrawn.html">
     X-Brawn's
    </a>
    case, this asymmetry is good when taken to an extreme, but in such a small
case as this, it just looks... wrong. The upper part of his arms also doesn't
"lock" into any sort of position, so it's easy to accidentally turn them
upwards and dislodge the shoulder blades. Rather sloppily-built, there.
Grimlock's legs are rather long, but they wouldn't look that bad if it
wasn't for the fact that his waist has no "set" position where it's locked.
Because of his, his legs are usually in an uneven position unless you're
really careful. His lower legs also look a bit hollow, and rather detract
from the appearance a bit. At least he's rather large for a deluxe, which
is a plus. Grimlock's shovel detaches from his vehicle mode and re-attaches
on his back in this mode, making it look like he has some kind of cool
scorpion tail. Nifty! However, it fits into Grimlock's back tab a bit loosely,
so it falls off a bit easier than I'd like. Grimlock's back connector tab
(used when combining into Landfill) also sticks out of his back a bit too
much for my liking. Grimlock's face and chest are very well-done and detailed;
Grimlock's face looks like it has a miniature shovel on the top of it,
which hints at his vehicle mode. He also has a nice grin detailed onto
his face, which adds to his character. On his chest, you can see all sorts
of neat patterns, and some mechanical tubing in the lower regions. A nice
touch.

    Becomes either both
the arms or one of the legs for Landfill, depending on the configuration.

    Although Grimlock has
his nice points, including a robot mode with a lot of character and a pretty
decent vehicle mode, he has a lot of flaws, too. My least favorite of the
Build Team members.

      A seasoned warrior, Grimlock is second
in command of the construction Autobots. He looks very harsh but is really
calm and upbeat. He works closely with the Construction Team leader to
pass on the tactics and experience he has gained in his many battles. He
can be counted on to assess every situation and come up with a good plan
of action.
