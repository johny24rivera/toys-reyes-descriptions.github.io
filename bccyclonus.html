    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Ultra Jetstorm.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Ultra
Jetstorm

     The classic G1 character
of Cyclonus is resurrected for Transfans, this time as a purple-and-silver
repaint of Ultra Jetstorm. This toy has practically every shade of purple
you can THINK of on it, and its color scheme definitely hails from the
old Cyclonus toy, with some dark blue thrown in for a little more contrast.
The "metallic" look of most of the toy is also definitely a plus. Unlike
the Ultra Jetstorm toy, Botcon Cyclonus doesn't seem to have the widespread
chrome chipping problem, thankfully. At least, it doesn't yet.... Cyclonus
has two Decepticon symbols emblazoned on his wings, and a Decepticon spark
crystal. However, the spark crystal is not transparent with a symbol etched
on the back of it- instead, it's solid with the allegiance symbol painted
on the front. Not quite as cool of an effect, but it's still neat-looking.
However, one thing noticeable about Cyclonus is he doesn't have as much
paint detailing as Ultra Jetstorm- something you would have expected MORE
of in a Botcon toy, not less. And there's no new paint applications (with
the exception of the Decepticon symbols), just the same old ones in different
colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon Cyclonus, so he retains all the features and flaws
of his predecessor in that area.

     Cyclonus is a pretty
cool toy, with a neat color scheme and minus the chrome chipping problem
of Ultra Jetstorm. However, the less paint detailing and lack of new paint
apps cancel those positives out. So, I can't say I like Cyclonus any more
or less and Ultra Jets. Recommended if you like the exclusives, but otherwise,
don't bother.

       After exploiting Megatron's sinister
attempts to ensnare his Spark in a Vehicon body, Cyclonus escaped Cybertron
in hopes of fulfilling his proud Decepticon heritage. Powerful, subtle,
and loyal to the extreme. Capable of drawing strength from his enemies'
attacks through bleedback receptors mounted in his fists. Highly maneuverable
in jet mode due to dual fusion-powered engines and an advanced multi-wing
design. In both modes, Cyclonus is armed with close-range oxidating pulse
cannons and independently targetable incendiary missiles. Vulnerable only
to leaders that would exploit his skills for their own evil purposes.
