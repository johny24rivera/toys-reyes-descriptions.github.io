    Crankcase's Chevrolet
suburban SUV mode is pretty accurate to its appearance in the movie, at
least when it comes to proportions and detailing; all the details, from
the major stuff like windows to small things like door handles and the
rear license plate, are all molded into this toy. There also aren't any
real robot extras to speak of in this mode, though there are a few minor
gaps in the back end of his roof because of the transformation. All in
all, it's a very solid mode, except-- and this is a very big "except"--
there's not nearly enough paint detailing. Now, I know that Crankcase is
mostly black, but other than the sides of his siren lights and his headlights,
he has NO paint detailing here, which is a major oversight. They could've
gotten away with keeping the windows black, but the grill and back bumper
at least should've been painted silver. He really looks almost prototype-ish
with how little paint he's got in this mode, which is only amplified by
the fact that his color scheme is VERY one-tone.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    As for Crankcase's robot
mode... geez, where do I start? The panels on the back end of his molded-in
arm details are way too large; a big panel of his front hood sticks up
blatantly behind his head; his shoulders and hood halves don't really tab
into any definite place to make them "stable" in this mode; there's a relatively
big gap in between his face and the front of his chest; his lower legs
are very inaccurate to the movie, being too "chicken-walker like"; plus,
the wheels on his feet prevent him from standing up stably. On the plus
side, the mold and paint detailing on his chest and face in particular
are very intricate and well-done, and the stabby-spikes on the ends of
his hands make into this tiny version. His articulation is above-average
for a Legion class figure, too; he can move at the shoulders (at two points),
hips, knees, and ankles.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Crankcase's vehicle
mode is quite accurate for such a scale, but the toy is almost devoid of
paint apps, and his robot mode is a mess for the most part (particularly
with the legs and shoulders). One of the worst new-mold DotM Cyberverse
toy, in my opinion; just save up a couple extra bucks and get the superior
deluxe version of the character instead.

      Crankcase never fights if he can help
it. He is a spy and saborteur, not a warrior. When he does fight, it is
on his terms, and only when he is assured of swift victory. He prefers
to lurk in the shadows, damaging his enemies' support network, while other
Decepticons tackle the combat.
