    Starscream's vehicle
mode is an F-22 Raptor, though it's hardly very convincing for an alt mode.
The top looks alright, with good proportions on the main body of the jet
and the wings, and the dull tan &amp; black color scheme, while not the
most attractive, certainly fits the realism look of the movie and is perfect
for a jet. Starscream has got some REALLY noticeable undercarriage junk
in this mode, though. For one, the arms are VERY noticeable under the wings,
though part of this is because of the gimmick-- as you roll Starscream
forward on a flat surface (or just turn the front parts of his arms), the
three missiles housed in each of his arms will fire off one by one. They
can fire off a little easily, however, as there's no resistance before
you hit the point where one fires, so the gimmick can get a little annoying.
Thankfully, there's flip-out pieces on the side of each arm that can house
the missiles somewhere besides the launchers. Starscream's robot legs also
stick out from the underside of the jet mode rather obviously, though at
least they tuck away and mesh with the overall shape of the mode, unlike
with the arms. Starscream's head is also pretty visible on the rear end
of this mode-- there's no jet engines on the back at all, sadly. On the
plus side, I do like the black "worn" paint fade on the wings, and the
transparent cockpit looks very nice, with a little pilot's seat molded
in there and everything. A little more mold detailing could have been done
on the wings, however.

    Starscream's robot mode
is certainly one of the less human-esque movie designs in regards to its
proportions, which resemble a gorilla's more closely than a human's, what
with the long arms (oh, and the chicken-walker-esque feet). I'm not too
fond of the proportional change-- I just don't feel it fits a jet Transformer
well, much less a scheming character like Starscream. However, the head
sculpt is perfect for the character-- smooth and evil-looking, with quite
a hint of scheming intelligence hidden in there. The mold and paint detailing
in this mode is considerably better than in jet mode, especially on the
broad chest, the head, and even portions of the back that aren't clearly
visible in either mode. Despite my grievances with Starscream's overall
gorilla-esque proportions, however, I do LOVE how all his wings fold together
so nicely into his main body. Pretty much every jet Transformer to date
has had their wings just hang off them in robot mode, but not Starscream--
all of his wings fold on to the sides or back of his chest, and I love
how the nosecone and main body of the plane split apart to reveal a bunch
of mechanical detailing on his chest. This leaves him with no real jet
mode kibble, which is pretty cool. My grievances with Starscream's arms
still carry over to his mode, however-- I don't like that BOTH of them
have the rotating-fire gimmick, I wish he had at least one normal arm.
At least he has three claws positioned around each missile launcher that
can open and close for pseudo-hands, though. Starscream's articulation
is slightly limited due to his abnormal proportions-- he can move at the
head, shoulders (at three points), elbows, claws, hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and ankles. That sounds like a lot, but his broad
chest and waist construction make his shoulder and hip articulation a bit
limited.

    Voyager Starscream is
one of the Movie mainline's weaker molds, even though it is pretty accurate
to the movie design in robot mode. I do love how all his wings and such
fold away in robot mode, even if it is oddly proportioned, but his jet
mode needs a LOT of work with all its obvious undercarriage junk, and his
missile-firing gimmick can get rather annoying.

      Leading the hunt for the AllSpark during
the absence of Megatron on Earth has given Starscream a taste for command.
He has experienced firsthand the brutality that allows Megatron to maintain
control over his Decepticon legions. It is a style of leadership that Starscream
takes to with gusto, punishing disobedience without mercy and rewarding
successes only with a narrowed eye and threatening gesture. He craves ultimate
control, and looks forward to the day when Megatron makes the mistake that
allows Starscream the opportunity to slip a jagged shard of steel between
his processor clusters.
