    Stormcloud's vehicle
mode is a helicopter. Unfortunately, it's not a very good helicopter. For
one, the robot legs are clamped onto the sides of this mode, actually extending
quite a bit back from the main body of the helicopter. So it's pretty darned
obvious that they are, in fact, the robot legs. But I think what's even
worse than that, though, is that the robot arms are VERY clearly on the
underside of this mode, painted oversized fists and all. It's below the
main body of the vehicle, so it doesn't mesh with the overall structure
of the mode, either. And the wings coming off the sides of the arms to
try to "disguise" them by making them an essential part of the vehicle
mode are pathetically small, not to mention far too low on the helicopter
main body. Two other, less major, downsides to this mode are the fact that
there is no landing gear for the helicopter-- it just stands on top of
the Energon weapon-- and the fact that, because the main rotor folds in
half for robot mode, the two rotor halves aren't quite level with each
other, with one being slightly lower than the other. And the orange used
for most of Stormcloud is REALLY not fitting for a helicopter... I mean,
it's not bright, but it's an orange used better for construction vehicles
and the like. Using it on a military helicopter just makes it look a little
Playskoolish. I do like the brown, blue, and metallic copper used on Stormcloud's
other parts, however- they manage to go together rather nicely, and are
actually FITTING of a military vehicle. Another positive is that Stormcloud
has a lot of paint detailing, even if the solid orange plastic obscures
some of it-- there's little armor plating, hinge details, and the like.
There's also two little seats and a control panel inside the see-through
cockpit, which is pretty cool on such a small toy.

    Stormcloud's robot mode
is a bit better than his vehicle mode, though it does suffer from a few
problems. For one, the head is too small, and the chest sticks out too
much, with a large hollow hole in between the front of the head and the
front of the chest. The fists are also too large in proportion to the arms.
And the helicopter main rotor, tail, and tail rotor also hang off his back
rather unceremoniously. The blades also don't really lock into any set
position in robot mode, either, so their constant swinging around when
you move Stormcloud can get a little annoying. But Stormcloud does have
some definite plus; for one, his articulation is awesome-- he can move
any point you can reasonably expect on a basic toy. And his feet, without
being too big, are large enough to keep him stable, so you can get him
into a good number of poses. His head sculpt is also pretty cool, as it
looks like he has a pilot's helmet on-- again, fitting in with the whole
"all business" Combaticon team look while still being appropriate for the
vehicle mode. His Energon weapon is also pretty cool-- it's a gun with
FIVE barrels. Now, if that ain't packin' a lot of firepower for a basic,
I don't know what is. Stormcloud's Decepticon spark crystal is on his upper
back in this mode, and his blue Powerlinx symbol is on the right side of
his helicopter tail.

    Stormcloud has some
good points about his robot mode, even if it is pretty unoriginal and a
tad on the boring side. But his vehicle mode is just plain poor, and his
color scheme is rather ugly. Easily my least favorite of the Energon combiner
limbs.
