    Skids' vehicle mode is
a van. Like all of the early G1 alternate modes, it's very good, with no
robot extras at all. Rubber wheels, good proportions, that sort of thing,
and his color scheme is nice. The windows, however, aren't nearly as translucent
as they are on most of the G1 toys- you can hardly see anything through
them. I mean, I don't mind, since I don't want to see the robot innards
anyways, but some collectors might. Also, because of the transformation,
Skids' front wheels tend to stick out a little farther from the main body
than they should. But again, this is a pretty minor problem. One thing
that may deter many people from buying Skids, however, is how extremely
small he looks in vehicle mode (the mode he's packaged in). He actually
looks like he's smaller than a basic, even though if you're going by mass,
he's about the same size as one. But still, asking $30 for this guy is
even more ridiculous than it was on the previous Autobot cars.

    In robot mode, Skids
looks surprisingly good for a G1 toy, with great proportions, for the most
part. (For once, the chest isn't too big!) The van doors behind his shoulders,
while technically extras, complement the mode rather than hinder it. The
robot mode also has a very "thoughtful" emotion carved into it- fitting,
given that Skids' function is a theoretician. Skids' main problem in this
mode is his arms- they're very stick-like, with no discernable elbows,
and tend to come out of his body at his lower chest, rather than his actual
shoulders. It looks pretty odd. Skids' articulation, like most other G1
toys, is also pretty bad- he can only move at the shoulders at two places,
and that's it. And, although I don't usually comment on stickers, some
of Skids' go in the most inane places- two, for example, go ontop of his
(uneven) wheel axles. Yeah, THOSE will stay on... Skids has three weapons-
a double-barreled gun, a single-barreled gun, and a missile launcher. Since
the missile is so small that kids can't choke on it, it hasn't been lengthened
any for the reissue, so you don't need to worry about that. The guns clip
onto the tops of Skids' arms rather than him just holding them in his fists.
I don't mind it much, but it is worth noting. Since Skids' has three weapons
and only two arms, though, it's kinda difficult to get him to hold them
all at once...

    Skids is actually a
fairly good G1 toy- his only major problem is his arms in robot mode- but
he is a G1 toy. So that means his weapons can't be stored in vehicle mode,
and he has almost zero articulation. Plus, there's the $30 price point,
which will no doubt deter all but the most dedicated collectors. If you
can get past all that, though, then by all means, buy him.

      A daydreamer... often bumps into things
at 60 mph while pondering Earth life instead of a Decepticon attack. Considers
Earth one vast lab for his research. His findings are often invaluable
to fellow Autobots. Enormous memory storage capacity. Carries a liquid
nitrogen rifle with 600 foot range. Twin electron blaster of 20,000 volts
can short-circuit almost anything. At 60 mph can stop within 25 feet. Not
very fast... often in danger due to daydreaming.
