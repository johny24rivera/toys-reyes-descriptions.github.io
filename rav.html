    Beast mode is a raven.
This mode is pretty good, at least aesthetically. The detailing is decent,
although a lot of it is on the transparent plastic, where it's hard to
see. This mode would have been rather bland if it wasn't for the addition
of all those spots and stripes on Rav, so kudos to Hasbro on that. The
weapon missles stick out a bit too far out the back for my liking, though.
Sadly, Rav also has extremely limited articulation in this mode, limiting
his playability and poses. All he can move in this mode is his mouth and
his feet. His wings can't even move like they're supposed to! The only
hinge on his wings is on the bottom (for transformation purposes), and
it looks really weird if you try to make-believe he's "flying" by pushing
them out that way. He also has a spring on those hinges which makes the
wings spring back into their original position anyway.

    Transformation to Rav's
crossbow mode is simple; merely push down on a tab under his rear missles,
and voila, it does nearly all of it for you. All you have to do manually
is swing out the hinges of the crossbow and maybe push the beast head in
a little more.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Although Rav's weapon
mode is recognizable- it's a crossbow that an fire two missles individually-
it has a rather large extra under it. The compacted raven body is much
larger than the crossbow itself, which detracts from this mode quite a
bit. Fortunately, Rav can at least aim the crossbow within a limited range;
by moving his raven feet up or down, you can position the crossbow higher
or lower.

    Rav's original color
scheme (shown in each of the above pics on the left) is pretty neat, what
with its red, bronze, and black color scheme, I personally like the Rav
repaint's color scheme better (shown in each of the above pics on the right).
The repaint has a very dark color scheme, being mostly dark blue and silver,
which is much more suiting that of a raven. The repaint is also commonly
referred to as "Cro" or "Chro", as that was what it was originally suppposed
to be named (after a crow, of course).

    A pretty neat-looking
beast mode, and a functional, if not that pretty, weapon mode. I recommend

    a bit more, however.

      A crafty and agile winged warrior who
usually keeps to himself. When in battle, the small airborne spy packs
a big time punch! He converts into an Energon crossbow, whose power was
given to him by an ancient female Autobot resistance leader for courage
in battle. Rav can "fry" the main circuitry of an enemy's data bank with
a blast of arrows while in Energon crowssbow mode. When he's not scouring
Cybertron for Vehicons, Rav enjoys "talking" with Nightscream via a complex
series of musical tones.

     (NOTE: Many people may have trouble getting Rav back into beast mode.
TO do this, make sure that the small tabs on the bottom of Rav's beast
neck are above the small tab at the back of the crossbow launcher. The
transformation WILL NOT WORK unless you do this.)
