    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Treadshot. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Treadshot

     Windrazor's color scheme
really bugs me, probably even moreso than if it were, say, fluorescent
green and yellow or some such blargtastic combination like that. Why? Because
it's ALMOST good. Most of the colors on Windrazor look just fine-- the
light gray, black, and white go together very well, and are great colors
for an Autobot flyer. He also has a pretty good number of paint apps, and
even though he's a repaint of Treadshot, most of his paint apps are in
different places than his fellow Aerialbot. (Though personally, on the
places where the black is applied, sometimes it's not applied overall every
single part of the piece of plastic, leaving some places their usual gray.
It doesn't look bad, but instead of covering up gray plastic with black
in all but a few places, why not just make the PLASTIC black?) No, what
really bugs me is that ridiculous bright pinkish red used for most of his
main body. I mean.... it's practically PINK. As a main color. It certainly
doesn't make Windrazor look like he should as a giant mechanical war machine,
that's for sure. And it the pinkish red was just a slightly different shade--
like, say, the red on
     <a href="enstormjet.html">
      Energon Storm Jet
     </a>
     --
all of the colors on Windrazor would have come together perfectly. But
because of that relatively small shade difference, it throws off the whole
toy. I mean... what were these people THINKING?

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Windrazor. Though he does have a new nifty blue Powerlinx
symbol on the right side of his chest in robot mode now, whereas Treadshot
didn't have that...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Windrazor's color scheme
is good-- except for that ridiculous pinkish red. It ruins the whole scheme.
So out of the two versions of this mold, I'd easily recommend Treadshot
over this guy-- though, of course, it you want to form Superion Maximus,
you need to buy them both.
