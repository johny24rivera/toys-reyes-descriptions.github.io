    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to 6" Titanium Rodimus Prime.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of 6" Titanium Rodimus

     Menasor has to be the
most nonsensical repaint out of the entire 6" Titanium line. First off,
G1 Menasor (which the packaging insists is the universe this toy belongs
to) was a gestalt, made up of a truck and 4 cars. Second, the core component
of Menasor, Motormaster, was a a truck and shared a similar color scheme,
so it wouldn't have been a stretch to just say in the toy bio that Motormaster
was his "original name" but he changed it for some reason (even though
the real reason was that Hasbro lost the copyright to the name Motormaster).
But the bio makes it some weird amalgamation of Menasor into one body,
which makes no sense and sorta defeats the purpose of making the dude a
superweapon. Anyways, the toy itself looks quite nice-- the black, silver,
and gray play off each other quite well, particularly the silver paint,
which is a really metallic shade of the color. The dark purple accents
on robot mode also help to keep Menasor from looking too monochromatic,
and although the color scheme as a whole isn't the most original, it still
looks good and is very Decepticon-y.

     Titanium Menasor, taken
by itself, is a decent, if unoriginal, repaint, and is one of the better
Titanium molds to boot. However, given the total nonsensical nature of
the "homage", it ends up looking much more like an evil Rodimus than Menasor,
particularly when you take the silver flames into account. If you don't
mind that and the $5 U.S. markup for being a SDCC exclusive, than by all
means get him-- but if the weird homage bugs you, then you're better getting
the original 6" Titanium Rodimus.

       Experimental mechanics may have successfully
unifed the gestalt frame of Menasor into a while physical creature, but
no level of shell programming or kernel restructuring has been able to
modify his fractured mind. Constructed from the bodies of the five Decepticon
warriors who once combined to form him, he is nearly indestructible. He
is the ultimate in state-of-the-art destructive capabilities, driven by
an almost mindless rage at the psychic agony that constantly torments him.

       The dominant personality within him
is that of the former leader of the Stunticons, Motormaster. Hated by his
teammates, he nevertheless exercised an iron-fisted control over the team
- a control that slipped only once the five found themselves unified in
Menasor. Even now, hardwired into the command network of the new body,
he withstands a constant mental assault from the suppressed personalities
of his four underlings. As a result, Menasor, who should be the ultimate
weapon, is little more than a destructive monster, incapable of following
a plan, and desirous of nothing more than to smash everything around him.
