    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Armada Cyclonus. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Armada Cyclonus

     Buzzsaw is one of the
most obscure homages in a Transformers line-- he's a nod to the non-show
Beast Wars Waspinator repaint
     <a href="buzzsaw.html">
      of the same name
     </a>
     !
Talk about the last thing I'd think of doing a homage of! Regardless, the
new remolded head looks fairly similar to Beast Wars Buzzsaw, though not
so close that I'd have thought it was him without being told so. (Because
of the space constraints for the head in this design, Buzzsaw's head looks
decidedly more rectangular on this version than on his Beast Wars self.)
The helicopter cockpit has also been completely remolded, with more weapon
details on the side such as missile packs and a window design that looks
a bit more insect-like. There's also an added gun below the cockpit that
rotates if you plug in one of the Armada Minicons that can connect to this
mold under the cockpit. Then, by pulling the trigger that makes the main
rotor spin in helicopter mode, the gun moves back and forth! (If you want
to plug in the Minicon Crumplezone into Buzzsaw like he could plug into
Cyclonus, you can do that too-- the cockpit swings up to give Crumplezone
his required attaching cavity.) The other remolds done to Buzzsaw have
to do with replacing the mold's Minicon gimmicks with Cyber Key gimmicks.
The Minicon ports on the outside of the arms that, when activated, would
fire the locked-in missile for that arm, have now been replaced by Cyber
Key ports that accomplish the same thing. Unfortunately, though, you can't
plug in the Cyber Key without launching the missile. The Minicon ports
on the legs have remained on Buzzsaw, but they don't activate anything
anymore; instead, the guns holstered in the legs (which have been remolded
into a new design themselves) can be deployed by manually flipping them
up.

     As for Buzzsaw's color
scheme, it's appropriately reminiscent of his Beast Wars self; yellow is
a main color, with purple a secondary one. Gray has been added to help
keep the scheme more varied, and the green used for the helicopter cockpit
is the same color as the eyes on his Beast Wars version. The yellow used
is a bit louder than the tone used on his Beast Wars self, however, and
I would have preferred a duller shade to the one used. The yellow and the
gray, since they're both light colors, also clash a little where they meet
on the figure. Other than that, though, it's a fairly decent scheme.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Cybertron Buzzsaw has
had some fairly extensive remolding done, and all of it is pretty good.
Overall, however, I'd rate his color scheme below Armada and
     <a href="encyclonus.html">
      Energon
Cyclonus'
     </a>
     , but above
     <a href="plcyclonus.html">
      Powerlinx Cyclonus'
     </a>
     .
Plus, this is still the worst Decepticon mold from Armada we're talking
about here. As such, even if you don't have any of the previous versions
of this mold, I'd still only recommend this toy after you've bought most
of the other stuff Cybertron has to offer.

       Despite the evacuation of Cybertron,
and the incredible danger presented by the black hole, many of the bravest,
craziest or most foolish stayed behind. Buzzsaw is one of the crazies,
a dangerous rogue from the Decepticon old guard who intends to hoard as
much of the planet's Energon as he can for himself, hoping to gain enough
power to destroy the Autobots upon their return! For now, he is content
to lurk in the abandoned cities of Cybertron, practicing his marksmanship
by blowing the tops off the old Energon Towers.
