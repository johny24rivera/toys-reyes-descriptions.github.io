    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Ultra Silverbolt.

     Like most other Universe
2.0 figures, Darkwind here is an homage to the G1 figure of the same name,
and it's a pretty ingenious redeco if you compare this redeco Darkwind's
G1 self (named Darkwing, but changed slightly for this version of the character
given that "Darkwing" is so closely associated with the '90s duck cartoon
instead now). In plane mode it's not quite as good of a match, but in robot
mode the figure is almost spot-on the same design compared to the G1 toy--
and the coloring reflects this. Dark gray is one of the main colors, with
a bit of light gray for contrast, but the main "light" contrast color is
a nice icy blue (it's not nearly as bright as it appears in the above pictures),
which really pops against the gray and the other main color-- purple. Adding
in a few other colors like a duller, darker blue and some nice metallic
gold and silver paint apps realy just make the whole toy look rather pretty--
even when compared to the G1 toy, which had more light gray than dark gray
and overloaded the "light" end of the color spectrum because of it. Darkwind
also has the same gold lightning bolt deco jobs on his wings in jet mode
that he had on his G1 self-- another nice throwback, and along with the
gold trim on the wings, keeps his jet mode from looking too boring like
Silverbolt's did. There are two small complaints I have about his color
scheme, though. First, the silver really doesn't contrast well with the
light icy blue in the few areas where they meet on the figure. Second,
the icy blue on the face looks weird.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe 2.0 Darkwind, though the electronic lights have all
been changed to a red color for this toy, despite the transparent purple
plastic used for the toy.

     Universe 2.0 Darkwind
is a great redeco, with lots of thought put into it and certainly a fitting
update for the character. He's also got quite the original &amp; eye-catching
color scheme, and some nice paint apps in both modes. It's a shame the
mold is so utterly simplistic and boring for its size class, otherwise
I'd wholeheartedly recommend him. (Though even, he makes a great companion
piece if you have

       There are those who might call Darkwind
bitter or pessimistic. In his opinion, if you're not at least a little
bit bitter, you're not paying attention. To Darkwind, life is one long,
unending trial of pain and suffering. What's not to be bitter about? Some
guys with his attitude write poetry. Others paint themselves black and
mope. Not Darkwind. If life is going to be nothing but a pit of darkness,
he's going to make sure that at least it's worse for everyone else than
it is for him.
