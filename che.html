    Che is the Beast Rider
for Cheetor, and it reflects it pretty obviously. The Che Beast Rider is
designed like a giant cheetah head, with small claw "battering rams" on
the sides. There is a double-barrel missle launcher coming out of the mouth,
and a wheel on each side. There is little difference between the two modes,
which are named "pursuit mode" and "battle mode". "Pursuit mode" is the
first picture shown above, in which the claws are tucked behind Che, and
the top weapons are concealed. "Battle mode" is the second picture shown,
in which the claws are rotated out to the front, and the top weapons are
revealed. A claw behind the top weapons is available in both modes to hold
any Transformer riding Che. The gimmick is also active in this mode; if
you press Che's "head" down and let it go, Che will zoom over a flat surface
for a while, his claws in front rotating around. A rather neat feature,
but I would have prefered that the claws did an up-and-down movement to
signify a "slashing attack", rather than the claws just rotating around
in place, which looks rather odd. The claws also don't stay in any position
when not activated, so it's hard to get them to stay the way you want them
to (face-up, so to speak, instead of out to both sides and such). Since
the two modes are so similar, it rather defeats the purpose of transforming
Che, and I usually just leave my Che toys in "battle mode". One major downside
to the Che toy is that the toy it was meant for, Cheetor, cannot fit in
Che! Che's too small for

Cheetor
    </a>
    , much less
    <a href="supremecheetor.html">
     Supreme Cheetor
    </a>
    .
Only basics and some deluxes can fit on Che and still look right. The missile
launcher can fire its two missiles individually, though, which is a definite
plus. The original Che (shown on the left side of each pic) is colored
very much like Beast Machines Cheetor, and is mostly yellow and green with
silver-black spots. The Che repaint, however (shown on the right side of
each pic), is colored more like the Battle for the Spark figure,
    <a href="nscheetor.html">
     Night
Slash Cheetor
    </a>
    . It's rather neat, too, since Night Slash Cheetor can
fit on Che alright. The repaint is mostly black and dark blue, with some
dark yellow. I really wish they would have stuck with black missles for
the repaint, however, instead of making them an oddly bright yellow.

    Che looks rather neat,
but he isn't a very playable toy; he's more like an accessory. Not to mention
that his transformation's a joke, and the Mega Cheetor can't even fit on
him! Although Che was a rather neat idea, it could have been implemented
much, much better.

      Relentlessly hunted by Megatron and
frustrated by Optimus Primal's beliefs, Cheetor swipes the blueprints of
the Beast Riders technology and creates his own individualized transport.
Encased in a unique Quintessian alloy recovered from the lower levels of
Cybertron, Che is impervious to most artillery attacks. Razor-sharp battering
rams slice through barriers while front-mounted galvaconductors emit 10,000-volt
charges to neutralize any obstacle. When in pursuit mode and at full acceleration,
Che can reach hypersonic speeds while maintaining incredible maneuverability.
Only Cheetor can operate Che at its peak performance through the focus
and balance of his spark energy interface, but allows his fellow Maximals
to pilot it in his absence.
