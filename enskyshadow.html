    Sky Shadow's vehicle
mode is a type of combat airplane. (Sky Shadow is an odd name for an Autobot,
though-- it sounds inherently evil, really.) This mode looks almost WWII-ish,
as you can tell from the silver metallic detailing on the cockpit, as well
as the small "bolt" pinpricks in between the cockpit windows. The mold
detailing itself is a bit lackluster in some places, while really exquisite
in others, so it all balances out as "okay". The proportions of the plane
are right on target, and it's quite realistic-looking (if you remove the
Energon weapon), especially when compared to many other Energon toys. Sky
Shadow has three retractable landing gear on his underside, which is a
nice detail on such a small toy. Sky Shadow is also equipped for combat-
he's got static machine gun mounted underneath the nosecone, and a rotating
twin-barrel cannon underneath the main body of the plane. (Neither of them
fire actual missiles.) He also has his Energon weapon mounted behind the
plane's cockpit, which is another double-barreled gun. It's rather odd-looking,
though, as it has a big plate on top of it that doesn't really serve any
real function except for when it's a gestalt foot or something. It just
is kinda slapped onto of the gun unceremoniously. It's also rather large
when compared to Sky Shadow as a whole, so it ruins the streamlined look
of the mode a little. Other small complaints are that the robot hands are
a little visible next to the rear turbines, and the main wings jut out
from the very bottom of the plane, rather than the middle where they should
be. None of these downsides really ruin the mode, though-- it's still a
pretty solid plane.

    Sky Shadow's robot mode
is pretty good-looking, and a bit better than the plane mode, in fact.
The proportions, again, are top-notch- a rarity for Energon Autobots in
their robot modes. His articulation is also great- he can be put into pretty
much any position you can reasonably expect on a basic toy, as most of
his joints are ball joints. I also like his turbine-hands-- they resemble
the hand-guns that
    <a href="arthrust.html">
     Armada Thrust
    </a>
    had, but if
you prefer your 'bot to have hands, they're molded into the plastic right
behind the turbines. The wings on Sky Shadow's back help complement the
mode, not subtract from it, so Sky Shadow really doesn't have any alt mode
kibble. His lower legs are asymmetrical-- one of the feet is formed by
the plane's cockpit, while the other is formed by the gun under said cockpit--
but they aren't terribly different from each other, so it's easily overlooked.
What ISN'T easily overlooked, however, is Sky Shadow's face-- it's my single
biggest complaint on the toy, as it looks just plain goofy. It's squat,
rounded, and has no discernable nose, while some ugly brownish-green paint
is used on the forehead and mouth. It's a rather milky type of paint, so
instead of a mouth, it looks like Sky Shadow has some goofy kind of mustache
in place. Plus, the rotating turret-cannon rests on top of his head, looking
like some kind of odd antennae. I really wish his head design was completely
different... Another, small, complaint is that it's rather difficult to
get Sky Shadow to hold his Energon weapon in robot mode, as the holes in
his hands are blocked a little by the plastic right next to them that is
used for the turbines. The holes also seem a tad small when compared to
the peg on the Energon weapon-- you really have to cram that weapon in
there, which is a pretty difficult feat, as the peg folds into the main
weapon far too easily. Sky Shadow's Autobot spark crystal is in the center
of his chest in this mode, and his lone Powerlinx port is only visible
once you unfold his Energon weapon, so it's not very useful.

    Sky Shadow is overall
a pretty solid basic, although he does suffer from a few minor problems,
like an odd robot face and wings in his plane mode that are too low. He's
still a lot of fun to play with, though, and looks pretty nice overall.
Recommended.
