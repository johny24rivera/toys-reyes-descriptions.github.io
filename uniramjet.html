        This version of Gunbarrel
is the EXACT same as the Armada version. No changes whatsoever. Some have
said that his gray may be a shade darker, but I don't see it. A complete

          Terradive is the only
one of Ramjet's Minicon partners that is different enough to warrant new
pictures, and even then, just barely so. The original's light blue has
been replaced with purple, and most of his silver apps are now orange.
No other changes, though. I actually like it a little better than the original's
color scheme- black, purple, silver, and orange always go well together,
I say. Some have said his color scheme was meant to be a homage to
          <a href="g1skywarp.html">
           Skywarp
          </a>
          ,
but I think that's more of a coincidence of mold color choices than anything
else. It's a nice toy by itself, but not a nice repaint when you see how
it's still so similar to the original Terradive.

             Thunderwing is essentially
the same as his Armada version, only his color scheme has been made darker
overall; his gray is several shades darker, and his blue is now more of
a dull purple. Oh, and the gold paint app on his nosecone is gone. So it's
basically as if you're looking at the original Thunderwing, only under
poor lighting. Big whoop. Again, he's a nice toy himself, but it's still
a complete waste of a repaint.

                Thunderclash is another
of Ramjet's partners that's almost exactly the same as the original version;
his light purple parts are now blue, and that's it. And I thought the purple
looked better anyway, so it's both inferior to the original AND a crummy
repaint. How nice.

                  Ah, here we go. Ramjet
is the only one in this Value Pack that is different enough to be worthy
of purchase, albeit he is the main figure in the pack. Other than being
primarily white, though, he's not really related to G1 Ramjet's color scheme
in any other way. Ramjet's color scheme is pretty much light all over,
here; that might have been nice for a happy little Autobot, but it doesn't
work very well for a Decepticon, unfortunately, especially one as evil-looking
as the Skywarp mold. In addition, his Decepticon symbols are, oddly enough,
not painted; it's as if this guy's TRYING to hide that he's a bad guy or
something. Anyways, he certainly does have his good points; I think the
silver paint apps on the wings are very nice-looking, as well as the ones
on his chest. The light gray also works well with the blue and white, although
the blue itself I think should have been darker, if the color had to be
used at all. One more weird oddity on Ramjet is that all his red coloration
is painted on; even those pieces that are solid red. Why they just didn't
mold those parts as red in the first place is beyond me, especailyl since
this particular shade of red paint is kinda cheap and looks like it could
wear off over time. He also still has that darned "misaligned legs" problem
that Armada Skywarp had, albeit to a lesser degree.

                   Ramjet himself is still
a pretty good toy, even though I think his color scheme could be better.
It's the sheer laziness of his Minicon "repaints" that really gets to me.
Why didn't they include those super-cool, flame-decoed paint jobs on the
Minicons that were on the back of the box? It boggles the mind... But he's
$20 for $27 worth of toys, so if you don't have the Air Military Team and/or
like the Armada Skywarp mold a lot, I'd recommend him. Otherwise, you're
better off passing this Value Pack up.
