    Perceptor's alternate
mode is one you're not going to see much of in today's Transformers lines--
a microscope. It's not a particularly realistic microscope-- the sides
are obviously his legs folded around, and the mian body isn't particularly
solid to the point where it's obvious his arms make up the sides and his
head is only particually obscured behind the lens. However, the magnifier
lens is extremely well-done, with a clear plastic lens used for both ends
(no, it doesn't actually magnify anything). The lens can move up and down,
as well as side-to-side a bit. There's also a dial on top of the lens that
lengthens or shortens the magnifier at the bottom on said lens, and is
a pretty cool touch, especially for this old of a toy. There are also two
dials on the side of the main body of the microscope, but they don't adjust
anything. Perceptor's chest plate makes a passable "petri dish" for the
lens to look at, but only just so. The color scheme for Perceptor is pretty
interesting-- just red and black is kinda boring, but adding in a greenish
teal to the mix is a pretty nice touch and makes the color scheme unique
without clashing, and provides some excellent contrast. His mold detailing
is what you'd expect from a G1 toy-- pretty basic, though there's a few
parts, where some neat circuitry detailing can be seen. Thankfully the
stickers are fairly large, so you won't have much difficulty getting them
put on this guy. Also, in case you're wondering, the black part of the
main body is where his diecast metal is.

    Perceptor has a sort
of third mode that's a tank. Basically it's just his microscope mode laid
on its back with the legs moved around a bit to give him a very square,
un-vehicle-like shape. I swore I was doing something wrong the first time
I transformed him to this mode, but that's how it goes. The lens makes
a surprisingly convincing cannon, and there are tread mold details on the
sides and little wheels on the underside to get him rolling along, but
all in all it's easily the weakest of his three modes.

    Perceptor's robot mode
is easily the best of his three modes, and definitely the one where the
design priority was. His proportions are pretty good for a G1 toy, with
everything being fairly on-the-ball if a bit stiff-looking, and his articulation
is fantastic for a toy from that time-- he can move at the shoulders, elbows,
hips (at two points), and knees (at two points). So, hey, no uni-leg! That's
certainly a plus for a G1 toy. The lens works very well as an over-the-shoulder
cannon, and the chrome chest plate and detailing is also a great touch.
Putting the dials on his lower arms is also a neat idea, as they almost
look like sort of mini arm-mounted shields that way. His face doesn't look
a whole lot like it did on the 'toon, though that's more the show's fault
than the toy's, considering this came first-- he's got a faceplate on the
toy, but in the show and in other incarnations he obviously doesn't. Still,
that's fairly easily overlooked. (Heck, if you're so inclined just draw
a mouth on there with a fine-tip permanent marker.) Perceptor comes with
two guns-- a standard plastic "doesn't-shoot-anything" blaster, and a gun
that originally could shoot spring-loaded projectiles. Unfortunately, due
to stricter safety standards nowadays the three missiles he comes with
can only sit one-at-a-time in their launcher, and they kinda fall out easily.
Blah. His heat-rub allegiance symbol is on the side of his left leg-- kind
of an odd place, there.

    G1 Reissue Perceptor
has one of the best robot modes from the line, but unfortunately his entire
toy is designed around that too much. His microscope mode has a great lens
setup, but his legs and arms are quite obvious in that mode, and his tank
mode is basically a square with a cannon. If you're looking for a great
toy of yore, you can do worse, but toy-wise this guy's toy is way too focused
on making one mode good.
