    Leadfoot's vehicle mode
is a weaponized NASCAR sportscar, and features a primarily red and brownish-gray
paint job. The proportions are okay, but he seems a bit "skewed" lengthwise,
being a bit longer proportionally than he should be-- it's not a HUGE issue,
but it is noticeable. With the exception of having no real back end, he
doesn't have any robot mode extras visible here. Both colors serve as okay
contrasts with each other, but it's admittedly not all that eye-catching
of a scheme; the white "42", Chevrolet, NASCAR, and Autobot symbols on
the sides do help to break up the colors a litle. Only his front window
and headlights are painted silver, though, and considering how many "exposed"
bits are visible here, he really could've used a lot more silver paint
here. Due to this being a mass-release version and most of the retailers
not wanting their rival's logo on a product they sell, Leadfoot's Target
logo on the front of his hood is also not there. The mold detailing for
Leadfoot is astounding, however, particularly at this scale-- he's got
pretty much all the details he does on the movie model, complete with side-mounted
missile launchers, a large rear-end rocket propulsion engine, and a roof-mounted
rotary gun.

    Leadfoot's robot mode
certainly emphasizes his, er, port-liness rather obviously. Even though
he has quite a potbelly on his movie model, here it is REALLY dangling
(not literally, but it looks like it is), and this is emphasized by how
short his lower legs here-- a bit TOO short for my likes, even considering
his characterization. He also has no feet visible at all, just the stumps
of the rear end of his vehicle mode. His arms are also a bit two-dimensional,
though to be fair this is very common among Legion class figures. One of
his fists is molded close, while the other can hold your standard Cyberverse
weapon. The actual detailing on his chest of the faux car windows-- and
particularly his face (sunglasses, beard, and all)-- are detailed excellently,
both in terms of mold detailing and paint detailing. When it comes to articulation,
Leadfoot is roughly par for the course for this size-- he can move at the
shoulders (at two points), hips, and knees, as well as inwards at the wrists
because of his transformation. Because of his lack of real feet and top-heavyness,
however, he can't exactly pull off the most dynamic poses.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Leadfoot is... okay,
but both of his modes suffer a bit because of his proportions-- his oversized
ponch and undersized legs in robot mode, and his vehicle mode is a bit
stretched lengthwise as well. He also feels like he's missing something
without his Target symbol there. I kind of feel a bit bad that this is
the
only version of the character available at mass retail, but it is what
it is. If you like the character this does a decent enough job of replicating
him at this small scale, considering you don't have any other cheap options.

      Leadfoot and his cohorts drive fast,
have a thing for loud weapons and maintain a strong dislike for Decepticons.
But Leadfoot is not all flash and show; while on Cybertron he was called
a genius weapon designer!
