    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Scrapmetal.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Scrapmetal

     Lacking a different name,
this yellow repaint of Scrapmetal is the most straightforward repaint in
Cybertron-- the only change is that all of the orangish-red of the original
Scrapmetal has been replaced with yellow, both when it comes to the plastic
and when it comes to the paint apps. The light gray and the black on yellow
Scrapmetal are the exact same shade as on the original toy, and the paint
apps are in the same places, albeit they're yellow now, of course. One,
tiny paint app has been added-- there's now a yellow speck of paint on
Scrapmetal's robot forehead, but that's it as far as new stuff. This yellow
version of Scrapmetal was taken from the cartoon, which has three different
colored versions of Scrapmetal-- the original orange-red version, this
one, and another blue version-- just being different variants of the same
bug on Cybertron. I would've preferred Hasbro bringing over the blue version,
as I think that looks better, but it's cool for them to offer a repaint
that many thought was only going to be a limited release in Japan. That
said, yellow Scrapmetal isn't nearly as different as practically every
other Cybertron repaint, and I still feel that just replacing one of the
core colors with another is a bit lazy for a full-fledged mainline repaint.

     No mold changes have
been made to yellow Scrapmetal, though when moving the crane-arm in vehicle
mode, the whole assembly doesn't come unhooked from the peg that sets it
in its position nearly as easily as on my original Scrapmetal.

     Yellow Scrapmetal is
a nice variant on the original Scrapmetal, but it's not nearly as different
as I would've liked for a full-fledged repaint, and I think the original
orange-red looks better than the yellow does on this toy anyways.

       Scrapmetal is little more than a beast.
Once, they were merely a dangerous breed of mechanical vermin from the
depths of Cybertron, but he and his Terrorcon brethren have been mutated
by the power of the black hole. Much larger than they once were, and far
more dangerous, these creatures now swarm on the surface of Cybertron,
led by Scrapmetal, who has gained the ability to reason, and plot. Now
that he has tasted the power that comes with command, his only desire is
for more power.
