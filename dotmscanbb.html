    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe TF1
'08 Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original TF1 deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy

     The main "gimmick" for
this subline is that the vehicle modes look like they're in the process
of being "scanned/reformatted", utilizing the cool visual effect that was
seen in the first live-action movie. It's no different with Bumblebee--
in vehicle mode, the front half of so looks pretty normal, and typical
of your usual movie Bumblebee colors and paint apps. The only real difference
here with Bumblebee's "typical" car-mode colors is that the yellow is a
tad lighter, due to it all being painted on for this release as opposed
to being a plastic color. The middle section of the vehicle mode has a
really nifty "scanning" effect, with a white line going across the middle
and several light blue "circuitry-like" patterns and a bit of transparent
light blue plastic used-- this all goes quite well with the yellow, in
the minor amount that it's used here. The back third or so of Bumblebee's
vehicle mode is completely unpainted clear plastic, as is usual for this
subline. This all translates into a robot mode that's largely "been there,
done that" from the waist up (except for those really nifty patterns on
his door-wings), with the bottom half being mostly clear plastic. To help
fit in with the "just-being-formatted" look, Bumblebee's major robot mode
color has been switched from black for a light milky gray on this version.
It DOES help the solid plastic robot mode bits not look nearly as obvious
in vehicle mode, but on the other hand the movie toylines already have
way too much of this color; it's boring, quite frankly. As such, the bottom
half of his robot mode ends up looking pretty bland as well, with the only
paint app really being a bit of yellow on his crotch, and the hubs of his
tires. Bumblebee's projectile is a transparent dull orange, however, which
does look pretty nice and contrasts against its surrounding colors quite
well.

     Scan Series Bumblebee
has the same mold changes that the initial
     <a href="rotfbumblebee.html">
      Revenge
of the Fallen deluxe toy
     </a>
     of him had; there are no mold changes made
specifically for this release, however.

     Scan Series Bumblebee
is a great mold with a really eye-catching and unique paint job in his
vehicle mode, though it's a bit less so in robot mode. If this mold hadn't
been used oodles of time before this, I'd recommend it without any hesitation;
however, as it is, most likely you have at least one version of this mold
by now, and if you don't, it's likely you don't like the look of the mold
anyways. Recommended for Bumblebee completists or those who (like me) really
enjoy these "scan series" paint apps; otherwise, it's a fairly easy pass.
Overall, it takes second place for the best color scheme I think this mold
has had (behind the Bumblebee in the
     <a href="crashlandingattack.html">
      "Crash
Landing Attack"
     </a>
     set).

       The first priority whenever Bumblebee
scans a new vehicle mode is the ability to fit in. As a scout and spy,
it's vital that he be able to pass unnoticed by Decepticon troops. Of course,
there's no rule that says fitting in can't go hand in hand with looking
good.
