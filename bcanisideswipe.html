    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Rodimus Minor.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated Rodimus Minor

     The Animated version
of Sideswipe is a bit different than many people were probably expecting;
as opposed to the young, overly eager soldier that he's usually portrayed
as, this is like an "older" version of the same character. In addition,
his color scheme is based heavily on G2 Sideswipe's, not the original's
color scheme; this is likely to emphasize he's a different guy than your
"typical" Sideswipe, and to keep him looking more unique from the mold's
original use as the already-red Rodimus Minor. I have to say, G2 homage
or not, I like the "new" color scheme applied to this particular mold;
the amounts of black and white already go together nicely, but light pale
green and (especially) the red really help to bring some nice color variety
and uniqueness to the mold, while keeping it from looking too loud, either.
All of the colors are just the right shade to achieve the maximum effect,
and there's no large area that's bereft of paint apps. There's a nice "police
badge" paint app on Sideswipe's chest, which fits with his police investigator
role (and thw black/white color scheme also helps him in this respect,
as well). The funky symbols on his car doors are Cybertronian for "S.S."--
the initials of his name on the original G2 toy-- but to make it look more
visually appealing, the second "S" was flipped. All-in-all, it looks really
nice, and emphasizes the "alien-ness" of Sideswipe's alt mode, considering
in this continuity he's never been to Earth. About the only color choice
I'm not fond of on Sideswipe is the clear plastic used for his windows,
as it makes his robot head fairly obvious underneath said windows in vehicle
mode.

     Sideswipe has the same
head sculpt as Breakdown from the core box set-- it's a very nicely-done,
crisply sculpted head that fits in well with the Animated aesthetic. More
importantly, it fits Sideswipe's head design (in a rather broad sense)
better than it did on Breakdown's, and the expression fits Sideswipe's
personality better, as well.

     Animated Sideswipe is
a great spin on a classic character that gives something new to his bio
without straying too far from being an homage to the character in the first
place. Great mold, great paint apps, a fantastic color scheme-- this guy's
got it all. Not just my personal favorite of all the Botcon 2011 exclusives,
but one of my favorite Botcon exclusives, period.

       A hard boiled, hard-hitting, hard-fighting
bot who's been around the block and seen it all. Underneath all his bluster,
though, is the same idealistic Autobot who has been serving in one capacity
or another for millions of stellar cycles. Incredibly observant; he misses
nothing and forgets even less. He has little patience with those who act
before they think, perhaps because they remind him of his own lost youth.
