    Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode is-- as I'm sure you'd expect-- a red-and-dark-blue truck cab. It's
fairly G1-esque in terms of the overall color distribution and general
look, but Combiner Wars Prime is a bit more curved in his silhouette, a
bit more "beefed up" and curvy (a little bloated, honestly), despite the
fact that he still is a flat-nosed cab. The proportions are generally pretty
good, though, and there's only a few minor extras in this mode. The most
obvious ones are his robot feet on the back end (as is the case with a
lot of Optimus toys, natch) as well as the obvious combiner waist behind
the red cab section, which is admittedly a bit of an eyesore on the back,
but does help to cover up the extra windows back there that are used for
torso mode. On a more minor note, the gray linear segments down the front
below the grill don't look all that great, but are used for the transformation.
The gray side-window segments around the painted front windows also look
bad, and the windows halfway down the side of the cab are also broken up
by a tab used for transformation-- in general the sides of this mode are
the weakest, due to all the transformation hinges, tabs, and color breakup
that seems to be required as part of his transformation. The silvery blue
used for Prime's windows is a pretty nice shade that contrasts with both
the red and the light milky gray quite well, as does the silver on the
smokestacks and the pale gold used for Prime's headlights. The rest of
Prime's color scheme is as you'd expect; dark blue, red, and some gray
(unfortunately of the blah light milky gray variety); I'm sure you're pretty
familiar with this color scheme by now, and this toy sticks pretty much
100% to that formula. For weapons, Optimus has two guns that are stored
on the back section of this mode, and with their detailing look a tad like
an "exposed engine", though they're still pretty obviously guns what with
the long barrels. One gun can also be plugged into the end of the other
to form a rather oddly elongated gun; honestly, it looks kinda weird so
I prefer to just have Prime wield them as two smaller guns.

    The transformation to
Prime's robot mode is largely taken from his various G1 toy forms, with
one impotant difference; the front parts actually split open and fold back
to become his shoulders-- his "cab window chest" is entirely fake, and
done likely only because that's so much a part of Optimus' iconic look.
In a fun twist, compared to just folding out from the back there's a little
part on the roof that rotates around a central point, allowing his robot
head to flip around during transformation. In this mode, Optimus still
retains a pretty traditional look, but "buffed out" a bit, particularly
when it comes to his shoulders and thick arms. His lower legs are also
a bit thick and rounded, as well. Due to his transformation, his main body
front is almost completely flat, but the really nice mold detailing on
the abs helps to alleviate this some. He's got a little kibble-- some paneling
on the sides of his lower arms, and obvious combiner ports behind his fists--
but generally he's pretty good in that respect, with his combiner chest
and waist staying behind his main body and out of the way pretty well.
His color scheme is a bit more varied in this mode, with a good amount
of his blah light gray (thankfully!) being painted a nice silver on his
abs, mid-arms, and lower legs. The fake gold "headlight" bits on his hips
are also a nice touch, and his head has all the paint you could reasonably
ask for. (Oddly, the Autobot symbols on his shoulders are stickers, not
paint apps.) Although he's sparse on mold detailing in some areas because
of the general curvy, semi-G1 aesthetic, Optimus still has an impressive
amount of detailing in some other places too, like all the little gear-like
details on his upper legs and on the middle of his arms. His headsculpt
has all the necessary elements for Optimus, but it's a tad pin-headed and
overly curvy for Optimus, and thus just looks a little "off". For articulation,
Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two
points), waist, hips (at two points), and knees (at two points); his hips
and shoulders-- having to hold up/keep together entire combiner limbs--
have nice, solid clickety ratchets to offer a good amount of resistance.
(This said, the hips are slightly mis-aligned, with their angles never
quite matching up. This isn't a big deal here, but when he's combined this
can get a bit annoying as it's amplified what with the longer limbs.)

    Optimus' torso mode--
"Ultra Prime"-- is a fairly minor change from his robot mode; the arms
fold up and the fists fold back to make the combiner ports accessible,
the robot legs crunch up a bit to form the upper legs, and the back of
Optimus' robot mode splits open with a combiner head folding up as you
turn the toy around. From the detailing-- particularly the rather intricate
detailing on the chest-- he looks a bit like the core of
    <a href="enprime.html">
     Energon
Optimus Prime's
    </a>
    combined form in this mode, a nice homage to Optimus'
former combining toy. This also shows in the headsculpt, which is basically
a larger, better-looking Energon Prime's, complete with the little circles
at the base of the antennae. The head is also painted quite well, though
I wish I could say the same for the open chest-- there's plenty of mold
detailing there, but no paint to bring out all those details. In fact,
in general this mode is rather bereft of paint apps. Optimus' hollow chest
cavity allows you to plug Blackjack or Rodimus or any versions of that
Combiner Wars Legends car mold in there, but the connection is pretty unstable,
unfortunately-- I prefer to re-close the chest cavity after folding the
head out, as the bulkier chest with faux windows works better for Prime.
The shoulders are generally pretty good and stay where they're supposed
to thanks to various tabs, though the obvious fists sticking out behind
the combiner ports are a definite eyesore. The waist/upper legs are...
well, very obviously just Optimus' regular legs. There's two panels that
fold up to help keep the upper and lower parts on each leg connected as
one, and the "codpiece" helps to cover up what would be anemic proportions
in that area for a combiner, but it still just looks rather weak. The feet
off the side of the "knees" look particularly bad, and the panels that
are supposed to keep the upper and lower legs together can come undone
a bit too easily. For torso mode, Optimus can move at the neck (at two
points, including an ability to look down in front of his chest a little
due to his transformation), at the base of each antennae, and at the hips.

    Combiner Wars Optimus
Prime has pretty decent robot and vehicle modes, with little kibble in
either, and a unique twist on his traditional transformation with the front
of the cab becoming his shoulders instead of his chest. However, he does
look a little "bloated" because of his oddly curvy silhouette that I would've
preferred to be more angular. His torso mode is also easily the weakest
of the Combiner Wars voyagers', with a general lack of paint, a weak/malfunctioning
chest combination gimmick, and a very uninspired transformation of his
robot feet into his torso upper feet with some weak panel connections.
He's certainly not a bad toy by any means, but the other Combiner Wars
torsos are at least marginally better, and the other versions even of this
mold I think all look better. Only recommended for Optimus Prime and/or
Combiner Wars completists (he does function better as a stand-alone Optimus
toy than as a combiner part).
