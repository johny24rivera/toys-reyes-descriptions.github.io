    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE Smash
'n Change Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the

     Following the other "Silver
Knight" Optimus Prime toys that are Target exclusives, this version of
Optimus forgoes his traditional color scheme for a largely gray one, with
more extensive (and more detailed) flame paint apps in vehicle mode than
on the original version of the mold, but without any of the "inverse flames"
(i.e., on the original, blue "flames" on the plastic cutting into the red
paint apps). In vehicle mode, this toy is HORRIBLY boring. I mean, yeah,
there's those nice flame paint apps on the front and black windows and
wheels, but otherwise he's all light milky gray. ALLLL light milky gray.
No grill paint apps, or bumper paint apps, or paint on that nifty shield-like
detailing he's got on the "handle" on the rear of this mode-- nothing.
Most of the other "Silver Knight" Optimus Prime toys had
     <a href="aoeskprimegrimlock.html">
      chrome
     </a>
     or
     <a href="aoe1stedskprime.html">
      a bunch of silver paint
     </a>
     or something,
but not this one. Thankfully, in robot mode his colors are a bit more diverse--
he's got some dark blue on his lower legs and hips (including some blue
"flames" on his knees), a few minor red flame paint apps on his chest,
and a rather nice shade of dark metallic gunmetal gray on his chest and
lower arms. The parts of his chest that aren't painted other colors are
painted silver, as is his head-- with some nice silvery blue eyes. That
said, even with this paint, there's no reason why most of his arms, waist,
and legs couldn't have been painted silver to make him all shiny.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Optimus Prime.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "Smash 'n Change" Silver
Knight Optimus Prime is largely un-needed. If you want a more simplistic
version of Silver Knight OP, go for the 1-step changer with more varied
colors; if you want one that actually looks shiny, go for the First Edition
version or the one that comes in a 2-pack with Grimlock. This version does
SOME things right-- like the dark blue paint apps on the legs and silver/gunmetal
chest in robot mode-- but he's got way, waaaay too much boring light milky
gray plastic (particularly in vehicle mode) to be much beyond blah (and
it's already a weak mold anyways).
