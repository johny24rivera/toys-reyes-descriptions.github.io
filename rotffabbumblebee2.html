    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Plasma Punch Bumblebee.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Plasma Punch Bumblebee

     Wowzers, Bumblebee's
seen better days. This is a rather creative idea for a repaint while still
keeping Bumblebee looking "Bumblebee-ish" enough-- it's basically his original
scheme covered and weathered by sand. There are parts of his original yellow
color scheme "poking through" the yellowish-white shade that makes up his
primary color in vehicle mode. Combined with the incomplete stripes on
BB's alt mode, it almost makes it look like he has a camo color scheme.
The paint apps used for his windows contrast quite well with the yellowish
white, and I especially love the bronze fade on the front window-- really
gives it a bit more of a "sandy" feel. In robot mode he loses a little
of this cool "covered with sand" feel, and generally doesn't make up for
it in other ways. The particular shade of brownish-orange used for his
projectile missile and a few other connecting parts is a really nice shade,
and I wish it was used in place of the rather dull gray that makes up his
robot mode waist, hips, upper legs, and wheels. It's kinda boring, and
his robot mode parts are really lacking in paint apps, which doesn't help
the situation. (He also doesn't have any paint apps on the rear end of
his vehicle mode-- all those "camo" paint apps really must've drained that
part of the budget.)

     Sand Attack Bumblebee
has the same mold changes that

     Sand Attack Bumblebee
is one of the more original repaint ideas among the myriad Bumblebee redecos
to come out of the movie lines, and I certainly think it's more eye-catching
than his traditional paint job, even if some parts of his robot mode are
a bit overly dull. Recommended over the other paint jobs this mold has
received.

       With the battle raging in the desert,
Bumblebee knows he needs to be ready. He upgrades with the latest in deep
desert weaponry, and prepares to charge into battle across the dunes. The
Decepticons will never know what hit them when they get a taste of his
sand blast!
