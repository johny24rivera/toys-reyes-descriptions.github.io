    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Night Slash Cheetor. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Night Slash Cheetor

     CatSCAN is a very interesting
repaint, to say the least. It's an Autobot... but it's an mecha-cat. So
would it be a Maximal, like the person who supplied his essential programming
(
     <a href="apelinq.html">
      Apelinq
     </a>
     )? I guess not... Anyways, the white-black-and-red
color scheme, with its silver and blue accents, is a pretty neat color
scheme, but I don't know if it's really... fitting... for Night Slash Cheetor's
mold. It's hard to put my finger on exactly, it just... doesn't fit. Night
Slash Cheetor's mold needs a darker color scheme than this. CatSCAN has
a few nice quirks, though, that Night Slash Cheetor doesn't. For one, a
very slight mold change was made- CatSCAN has an Autobot symbol emblazoned
on his chest, a nice touch. Secondly, CatSCAN is the only Botcon 2002 Exclusive
to have brand-new paint apps. The chalky dark gray is one of them- there's
a nice fade on the jetpack, but the presence of it on the face only looks
like CatSCAN managed to stick his face in a chimney or something. The other
new paint app is the taking away of Night Slash Cheetor's "spots" and the
inclusion of nice "glow-in-the-dark" detailing on some of his shoulder,
hip, and ankle panels. It's VERY nicely done, and almost looks like some
kind of cyber-virus has infected CatSCAN at those points. It looks especially
cool in the dark. (For some reason, the detailing on mine doesn't glow
in the dark much at all- but I've been told that this is not a common problem.)
The "swirly" gimmick that took place in Night Slash Cheetor's chest when
you activated his sword-slashing gimmick isn't prevalent on CatSCAN. Mainly
because his transparent plastic is a darker plastic, and the transmetal
gold plastic used for the swirlygig under it has white stripes that don't
stand out and reflect that well. Meh. Also, the Maximal spark crystal has
been replaced with a solid ball- now the allegiance symbol is on the chest,
not in the middle of the back.

     Other than the new Autobot
symbol, CatSCAN has no mold changes, so he retains all the flaws and features
of his predecessor in that area.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     CatSCAN has some pretty
neat gimmicks, and a very nice robot mode, like his predecessor. The glow-in-the-dark
detailing is also a very original and neat feature, but the overall color
scheme (which is definitely important) doesn't measure up to Night Slash
Cheetor's. As such, I'd recommend the original (and cheaper) version of
this mold. If you're a sucker for exclusives, though, he's alright.

       CatSCAN is in many ways like a lost
child in the wilderness -- he knows to some degree where he came from,
but is unsure as to where he will eventually end up. Brought to life by
a bizarre combination of Apelinq and his digitization powers and the artificial
intelligence of a medical diagnostic computer, this curious creature has
found a permanent home with the Wreckers team. Armed with two battle blades
of ancient Cybertronian design and a tail-mounted plasma torch, CatSCAN
could easily be considered a lethal one-robot army. This fact notwithstanding,
his fearsome appearance belies an inherently gentle and nonviolent personality
-- it is simply not in his programming to cause harm to other beings. Lacking
a Spark of his own, CatSCAN has a deep wish to understand the true nature
of his self-awareness. He looks up to Apelinq as a mentor and "creator
figure" and often acts as a voice of conscience among his teammates.
