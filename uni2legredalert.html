    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Hot
Shot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron
Hot Shot

     Red Alert here, like
many repaints in the Universe 2.0 line, is an homage to the
     <a href="g1redalert.html">
      G1
character
     </a>
     of the same name in terms of his color scheme and general
alt mode. While the original Red Alert had more of an emergency vehicle
bent, the Legends Hot Shot mold does the job fairly well with the right
color scheme. The white, black, and red color scheme is hardly original
by this point, but that doesn't mean that the colors don't go well together--
and it's very fitting for an emergency theme, of course. Red Alert has
the same "fire department" symbols on the sides of his vehicle mode that
the G1 toy had as well, which is a nice touch. The silvery-blue paint is
also a nice color to be used for the windows. Still, that said, there are
some things about Red Alert's paint job that I don't like. For one, he
really could use a tad more variety, like maybe one more secondary color.
The color scheme is just a bit old now, even if it is a direct homage.
I'm also not fond of how large the Autobot symbol is on the front hood
of his vehicle mode-- a bit more discreet, perhaps? Painting his face red
in robot mode also just looks rather ugly and is a bad move. And finally,
in robot mode he has a bit too much white showing-- a bit more black on
his legs and/or shoulders would have helped to break that up a bit more.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Red Alert
is a decent enough homage to the G1 version, but the color scheme is hardly
original by now, and this mold has been repainted enough where there's
been a better color scheme for it released (
     <a href="locexcellion.html">
      Excellion
     </a>
     ).
Only recommended if you really have a thing for the tiny Legends class
Transformers-- otherwise, Red Alert's an easy skip.
