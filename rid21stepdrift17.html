    This second shot at 1-step
changer RID2015 Drift goes full-circle... in that it has the same "switchblade"
transformation/design as the first "switchblade" 1-step changer,
    <a href="aoe1stepdrift.html">
     Age

    </a>
    . As for this version, the vehicle mode does have
the couple of oddities that are associated with switchblade 1-steppers.
That is, the hinges on the front hood are a bit distracting and ruin the
smoothness of that part; the front grill is a bit segmented-up as well
because of the transformation; the top of the car doesn't come up much
above the fornt hood; and the robot feet are rather obvious on the back
end. Drift's vehicle mode is also "squished in" slightly in terms of how
wide it is compared to how long it is, but it's a minor change; he still
has fairly realistic car proportions in that respect. The mold detailing
is decent towards the front, with his faux "headcrest" on the front of
the grill with the headlights on the side and striped details. His details
are quite basic beyond that, though with the basic window details there
on top (and "bolted-on-armor" details that are used for the robot mode
knees), he ends up being pretty smooth. Of course, being a curvy sportscar
he SHOULD be rather smooth, but this goes a bit more beyond what I'd like.
(I DO appreciate the taillight and exhaust port detailing on the bottom
of the robot feet/back end, however, even if it's not painted.) The bold
orange from the
    <a href="rid23stepdrift.html">
     3-step changer
    </a>
    makes
its appearance on this toy as well, and it makes for a great main color.
Unfortunately, on this smaller toy, there isn't nearly the amount of black
to contrast against it; the black stripes from this mode are completely
gone, with only a metallic dull red swish on the side doors making for
any kind of vehicle deco at all. The windows and kneepads are painted a
charcoal black, though compared with the "more pure" black wheels the slight
color change is a bit off-putting. There's also some more of that dull
red paint on the grill headcrest and on the feet on the back, and his headlights
are painted a nice light blue. However, there just needed to be more black
to offset all that orange in this mode-- the red is too close to really
provide enough contrast. Oh, and one last thing-- there is a port on the
top of this mode that you can mount a Mini-Con Weaponizer or other weapon
with a similarly-sized port on.

    Drift's transformation
is the same as the other 1-step "switchblade" TFs-- take the back ends
and pull them apart, rotating them around to become the feet while everything
else auto-transforms, and then fold his arms down. It's a super-fun transformation,
and I love it no matter how many times it's used. However, true to form
this mode does suffer from the same issues as the other 1-step switchblade
toys, as in he doesn't look that good from the sides. The legs from the
side are revealed to be the hollow halves of his car mode, and the legs
actually go up practically to his chest from that perspective. The mold
detailing is pretty much just the inverse of his car mode from that view
as well, so just... don't view him from those angles, I guess. His body
is also just a panel flipped over the front of the top of those large legs
to help mask how far up they go. Again, though, from a frontal view he
looks pretty good, especially for a one-step. He's got excellent details
on his chest, what with the faux car front/headlights and belt-waist, and
his arms have all the armored details that his other toys have-- just with
considerably smaller shoulders, due to the transformation. There's even
his Mini-Cons in disc mode molded into his lower arms, which is a nice
touch. His legs are a bit skinny on the top halves, but the bottom halves
are a bit closer to how he should look, being wider with black "kneepads"
and red feet. His headsculpt is pretty show-accurate as usual, with a silver
face, blue eyes, and a dull red headcrest, though I wish some black paint
had been added to his "facial hair". He's still almost all orange in this
mode, though the black paint on his chest, waist, and knees-- along with
the blue paint on his faux headlights-- helps break up the orange a bit
better than in vehicle mode. From a back view, some parts on his upper
back are black, but this isn't going to be seen often given how you're
"supposed" to look at him. I do really wish his arms had some more paint,
but otherwise he's okay in this respect. For articulation he can only move
at two points at the shoulders, just like the other 1-step switchblade
TFs-- not unexpected at this point.

    The 2017 version of
1-step RID2015 Drift uses the by-now familar "switchblade" transformation
design, which comes with all the expected positives (really fun transformation,
nice robot mode from a frontal view, decent alt mode) and negatives (very
low vehicle roof, obvious robot toes in alt mode, unsightly proportions
in robot mode if you look at him from the side or back). This is one of
my favorite 1-step designs, and I'd easily recommend it over the
    <a href="rid21stepdrift.html">
     previous
1-step RID2015 Drift
    </a>
    . That said, if you can only get one version of
a simplified Drift, I'd make it the sturdier, more accurate 3-step changer,
but this makes for a decent second-place effort.
