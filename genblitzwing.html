    The first of Blitzwing's
three modes that I'll focus on is his tank mode. He's just barely big enough
dimension-wise to pass as a Voyager-class toy, but he's very compact, and
the other two modes certainly look voyager-scale, so I don't mind it in
this mode. The weakest part of this mode is the rear-- there isn't really
any back end to this mode, just his robot feet sticking out the back and
a few tailfins from his jet mode. From pretty much any other angle, however,
this mode looks great and remarkably solid given that Blitzwing's a triple-changer.
There's a SLIGHT gap in between the sides and center of this mode-- due
to the sides forming his robot legs and his midsection forming... well...
his midsection-- but that's a small quibble. His proportions are otherwise
fairly solid, with only minor issues if you really want to get nitpicky
(such as the turret being slightly too large proportionally, and the gun
barrel being a bit too short and his treads slightly too small). All of
these are more than acceptable compromises given his triple-changing gimmick,
however. The way his legs move slightly outwards from their position in
his other modes to make him square here is quite a feat, as well as getting
the wings to fold into the body as much as they do. The mold detailing
on Blitzwing is quite well-done, with all kinds of details around his turrets
as well as "armor plated" detailing on his sides and a "porthole" molded
on the top of his turret (Blitzwing's treads aren't actual treads, though--
they're simply molded in, with small wheels on the bottom of them to help
him roll, as is standard with tank TFs). Blitzwing's color scheme is pretty
much what it's always been-- mostly tan with some dark purple and a bit
of gray, all of which come together to look quite good, fitting both a
tank, a jet, and Decepticon. I wish the gray were a tad darker to provide
some better contrast against the tan, however, but in some places the black
does that, too. Also, his tan paint is of a noticeably lighter shade than
his dull greenish tan plastic-- making the plastic a bit lighter of a shade
would also have worked better, too, but again, minor quibbles. Not as much
paint detailing makes itself known in this mode as in the others, but the
plastic colors are broken up enough where it largely doesn't matter. Blitzwing
can rotate 360 degrees on his turret base in this mode, though unfortunately
the barrel can't move up or down. I generally recommend leaving the turret
pointing in a forward or forward-diagonal direction, however, as if you
rotate it all the way to the side all of the plane junk stuck up in the
middle of this mode makes itself blatantly known. Blitzwing's cannon barrel
fires a spring-loaded projectile if you press in on the barrel, which is
a pretty nifty additional gimmick. Blitzwing's gun and sword accessories
can be stored in ports either on the top or on the rear sides of his turret
in this mode.

    Blitzwing's transformation
to jet mode is surprisingly involved-- not confusing, there's just a lot
of little steps. As far as overall appearances go, this is the weakest
of Blitzwing's three modes, as there's some very obvious chunks of robot/tank
(the robot arms/sides of the tank turret) that stick up on the top rear
two-thirds or so of this mode. Granted, there's no obvious hands showing
or anything that blatant, but it definitely does look out of place on a
jet and partially ruins the sleekness of it. There's also a noticeable
gap in between these two protrusions-- one that you will definitely want
to try to partially cover up by plugging Blitzwing's gun into the port
in the center of this mode. (Both accessories can also be stored on the
rear sides of this mode, though, just like in tank mode.) Also just like
in tank mode, just about every piece does "lock in" and have a solid, definite
place where it's supposed to be, which is great. ANOTHER thing Blitzwing's
jet mode has in common with his tank mode is that the rear portion is a
bit weak, with there being no real back end and the robot feet rather blatantly
sticking out the back. However, this is partially ameliorated in this mode
by the VERY creative use of the tank barrel as a "rear thruster". Blitzwing's
wings are slightly small proportionally, but not ridiculously so when you
consider that he's a triple changer. There's also small flip-out panels
on the underside of the wings to make them look not quite so skinny and
triangular in this mode-- something that wasn't absolutely necessary, but
is nonetheless appreciated. By far the best part of this mode is the solidity
of the front section of the main body and the nosecone-- Blitzwing does
indeed have a well-proportioned and detailed nosecone, complete with a
transparent cockpit that you can lift up to look at the pilot seat detailing
under it. His nosecone is made of the rubbery kind of plastic, both for
safety concerns and because of the unfortunate problem of his robot head
being ever-so-slightly too bulbous to fit inside the nosecone if it was
made of regular plastic-- as it is, you can sort of tell that that piece
is "bursting at the seams" a little because of the head inside of it, an
unfortunate design overlook. As far as colors, Blitzwing gets a bit more
varied here, with some nice red and yellow highlights popping up on his
wings and cockpit, making him look more visually appealing. The purple
also takes a bit more visual precedence in this mode, and is certainly
more fitting for a jet than a tank. Blitzwing does, surprisingly, have
landing gear in this mode, though only the front one actually folds out--
the rear two are simply molded onto the underside.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Blitzwing's robot mode
transformation is a bit easier, being sort of "halfway" in between his
two vehicle modes, with the various appendages simply extended instead
of collapsing together in some other way. I'll get the big downside out
of the way first-- Blitzwing's shoulders are supposed to tab into his body,
but without some modifications done with floor polish or the like, they
don't say in their slots. Like, at ALL. This makes his shoulders a little
shaky when you're moving him around, and you almost certainly are going
to have to reposition his shoulders any time you move his arms a tiny bit.
Is it annoying? Yes. Is it a huge deal-breaker, as I've seen many people
say about this toy? Not at all, not when all three modes look this good.
Despite having two alt modes, Blitzwing has remarkably little kibble here;
he has wing panel flaps on the sides of his feet and his shoulders, and
his nosecone doesn't fit in too snugly behind his robot head, but that's
about it. (I quite like the big tank turret behind his head-- it enhances
his silouhette and gives him some more firepower in this mode. His shoulders
are also a bit hollow-- due to his transformation-- and his jet wings stick
out ever-so-slightly from the back of his lower legs, but these are minor
grievances. Blitzwing just looks like a pretty proportional, solid robot,
hips jutting out from the side of his waist notwithstanding. The new red
and silver detailing helps to add more to his overall color scheme in this
mode, and his yellow-helmeted head also has a really cool gimmick-- just
like his
    <a href="aniblitzwing.html">
     Animated version
    </a>
    , this toy has
three different faces! By lifting up on the chin of each one, you can cycle
through his G1 head (his "hot head" and more G1-ized versions of his Animated
monocled "cool head" and jack-o'-lantern-like "crazy head"). Such an awesome
little gimmick and thoroughly unexpected-- plus, if you don't like this,
you can just have the "hot head" displayed the entire time and ignore the
gimmick, no harm done! But it does give Animated fans a rare nod in the
Generations line, and to me is the highlight of the robot mode. Unfortunately,
because his helmet is painted and it squeezes into the rubber nosecone
behind it for both of his vehicle modes, over time the nosecone piece can
take off some of that yellow paint in flakes-- a bit of a bummer, and again,
something they really should've fixed before releasing this guy. For articulation,
Blitzwing can move at the neck (surprsing, given his face gimmick), shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at two points), rotation at the wrists, and movement
at the hips (at two points), knees (at two points), ankles, and slightly
at his toe and heel on each foot. Given that he's quite stable and well-balanced,
this means that you can get some pretty nice poses out of him too, the
lack of waist rotation aside. As expected, you can hold Blitzwing's gun
and sword weapons in his fists quite easily, though there's pegs on the
backs of his shoulders if you want to "store" them.

    Generations Blitzwing
is an excellent toy in all of his modes, the obvious arm/turret side pieces
in his jet mode and lack of a real back end in both vehicle modes being
the only things that keep him from quite being on par with his fellow voyager

    . Yes, he also has
an annoying loose shoulder issue, but how bad this is is vastly over-hyped
by the fandom, I think, and doesn't at all stop me from highly recommending
this toy to any Generations Transformers collector, with ingenious engineering
and fun gimmicks all around.

      Within his heavily armored and highly
destructive body, Blitzwing has the ice-cold mind of a master strategist--
sometimes. At other times, he is a boiling cauldron of rage, waiting for
any excuse to unleash his firepower on the nearest target. And now and
again he is a chaotic whirlwind of bizarre behavior and intermittent bursts
of plasma fire. His unpredictability makes him a poor soldier, but his
raw firepower and unstable mind make him a useful tool for a commander
as capable as Megatron.
