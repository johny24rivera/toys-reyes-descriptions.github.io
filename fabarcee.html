    Arcee's Fast Action Battler
version has a vehicle mode that's actually fairly accurate proportionally--
except for the seat/engine area, which is a bit undersized. Her color scheme
is identical to her

    , down
the shade of pinkish-red plastic used-- i.e., it's not a shade I like very
much, it's a bit too flat. Howver, it's not outright bad, I guess, and
the black makes a nice dark contrast color against it. She also has the
"Cyberglyph" tattoos painted on her sides, and all necessary details--
like her headlights, wheel rims, and the like-- are painted. For the most
part, this mode doesn't have any robot extras, except when it comes to
the backside of her windshield-- Arcee's robot head is right there, staring
at you. It's a bit larger proportionally on this toy than on the mainline
deluxe version too, so it's a bit harder to ignore. Arcee does have one
gimmick, usable in either mode-- pressing down on her seat fires out the
tailpipes as one spring-loaded missile launcher. A pretty cool gimmick,
all things considered, though given how you handle the toy it can be triggered
inadvertently during transformation. (Plus it definitely makes more sense
in robot mode, heh.)

    Interestingly enough,
Cyber Pursuit Arcee's transformation is basically identical to her mainline
deluxe's, with only the specifics-- such as the number of steps it takes
to transform her arms and waist-- simplified a bit. She's definitely one
of the more difficult Fast Action Battlers to transform (although that's
admittedly not saying much). With a couple of exceptions which I'll get
to shortly, Arcee is actually a bit MORE accurate proportionally in robot
mode compared to her mainline deluxe version-- her wheel-feet seem a bit
more in proportion, as does her chest and arms. The waist is a LITTLE small
and the head a tad big, but neither of those are particularly huge deals.
She still does have all the vehicle mode extras that her general design
has, though, including large shells of the motorcycle's side hanging off
her arms, and the windshield and front wheel spoke hanging off the back
end of her shoulder. This is made worse by how overly skinny her arms are--
they're barely more than sticks. The seat makes a decent right arm, however,
and a big bonus she has over her mainline deluxe in terms of design is
how the wheel covers rotate around to the bottom of her wheel-feet to form
a decent stand WITHOUT the need for an extra detachable part. Her mold
detailiing is also quite good, such as all the little pistons 'n such in
her waist and the intricate detailing on her head (though the design still
creeps me out). Her paint detailing is also adequate, given that even her
arms are mostly painted silver and pinkish-red, but she really needed the
silver outline around her face. It looks a bit "off" without it. One area
where the mainline deluxe definitely surpasses Cyber Pursuit Arcee is in
the articulation department, though; on this toy, she can move at the neck
(at two points), shoulders (at two points), right elbow, at the base of
her right hand, and her waist (at three points). It's still decent, but
she could really use a bit more movement on her left arm and on the lower
parts of her body.

    Cyber Pursuit Arcee
is one of the few Fast Action Battlers I'd actually recommend OVER her
mainline deluxe version. Her vehicle mode is slightly inferior in a few
respects-- such as the undersized seat and more obvious robot mode head--
but it fits together much better, she has a nifty gimmick, and her proportions
are a LOT better in robot mode, even if she still suffers from the same
vehicle kibble problems in that mode that her mainline version does. The
best mold for RotF Arcee out there.

      When Arcee fights, she fights to win.
That's why she always makes sure her weapons are fully charged, her engine
is tuned to perfection. When a Decepticon sees Arcee in his rearview mirror,
he knows there's no escape.
