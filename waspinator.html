    Beast mode is a wasp.
A nice mode, but there is one big drawback: his back insect legs are his
robot legs that fold out. They donÂ’t look like insect legs at all, but
mutated hooves. Some smaller drawbacks include that his robot fists are
very clearly seen under his wasp head, and his articulation is limited
to his wings and back legs. The detailing is also only so-so, but the color
scheme is pretty nice.

    Robot mode is very nice.
His mutant bee head is the show-accurate head, and his legs and wings are
nicely done. However, his insect legs on his arms stick out a lot more
than in the TV show, and can really get in the way. His stinger becomes
a missle launcher, and little parts of his wings can come off and become
missles.

    A very nicely done transformer,
except for the insect legs in beast mode, and the arms in robot mode. Recommended.

      Like a rattle snake's tail before an
attack, a chilling sound buzzes in the distance as if to forecast approaching
danger. Suddenly from the sky the giant wasp appears, revealing its monstrous
face and bulging eyes as it streaks down for an aerial attack! The Waspinator
launches its secret wing missiles, striking the helpless victims below
with the poisonous power of a robotic cyber-sting!
