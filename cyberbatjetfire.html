    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cyber Battalion Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cyber Battalion Starscream

     <a href="genjetfire.html">

     </a>
     , this time it's
the other way around! First off, regarding the new colors-- this is definitely
a pretty on-point Jetfire color scheme. A medium red and "pure" white are
your main colors, with a bit of black on the feet, some silver on the faceplate
and intake vents, and a pretty nice shade of dark metallic blue on the
cockpit windows and the visor. However, both the black, silver, and blue
aren't really used much overall beyond those couple of details, leaving
much of Jetfire looking rather "same-ish". His colors are generally broken
up well in vehicle mode where more of the red and dark blue are visible,
but in robot mode in particular he's got too much undetailed white; his
arms and the sides of his chest are particularly bland. If they wanted
to stick to mostly just red and white, I suppose that's fine as it is G1-accurate,
but they should have varied up the placement a bit more, here. Certainly
when compared to Cyber Battalion Starscream, Jetfire's color scheme looks
way too simplistic in comparison.

     Jetfire has received
some noticeable remolding. First, obviously he's got a new headsculpt,
which looks very much like Jetfire with his faceplate and visor down, but
with smaller antennae due to the space limitations for the head in vehicle
mode. That last detail hurts the look a little, but not a lot-- it's still
a pretty good headsculpt. The main difference, however, comes with Jetfire's
vehicle mode, which almost is a whole new jet "shell" on the back/chest
of the robot mode-- the entire top of the jet, the main wings, the nosecone,
and the main body of the jet have all been remolded. The nosecone is now
a little more sleek-looking, with visible intakes, large red areas in the
middle of the body that are meant to replicate Jetfire's boosters as best
they could while still having them fold up unto Jetfire's back in robot
mode, and-- the biggest deal-- the wings are narrower and can move into
either a "windswept" or more "90-degree angle" position, which again hearkens
back to how Jetfire's vehicle mode traditionally has looked. The details
on the front of the jet mode are mostly just minor cosmetic issues, but
the remolding of the top of the main body of the jet with those "boosters"
and adjustable wings was not at all expected and really well-done, given
the transformation. Other than these substantial remolded bits, no other
mold changes have been made to Jetfire.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The amount of remolding
made to Cyber Battalion Jetfire's vehicle mode is impressive, and if it
were just the look of the vehicle mode parts I'd recommend this over Cyber
Battalion Starscream. However, the robot mode doesn't really have much
different about it beyond the head and looks too "Starscream-y". Plus,
the color scheme-- though not bad-- is a bit too basic with too much white
on the robot mode in particular, and definitely doesn't measure up to Cyber
Battalion Starscream in that respect. Because of these factors, I'd recommend
Jetfire a bit less than Starscream when it comes to the Cyber Battalion
line.
