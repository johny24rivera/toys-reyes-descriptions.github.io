    Optimus Prime's truck
form for the Fall of Cybertron game is a lot more bulky and less aerodynamic
than his
    <a href="genwfcprime.html">
     War for Cybertron
    </a>
    version; which,
honestly, makes him look considerably more like an actual truck (given
that the game takes place before they go to Earth, this can be good or
bad, depending upon how you look at it). His blockier proportions fit for
the most part, with the exception of the back end, which looks a bit too
high in comparison to the front, now that he's starting to look more like
an actual truck cab. The back end of this mode is hollow, which is a bit
of an eyesore, and the bottoms of his robot feet are obviously on the top
of his back half, but other than that Prime doesn't really have any robot
extras in this mode (you CAN pick out his hands from certain angles, but
they're fairly hidden in this mode and their shape fits in with the surrounding
pieces well enough). Prime's color scheme is blue, red, and gray, like
it's nearly always been-- I don't really have much to say about him in
that respect, you either like that color scheme by now or you don't. I
do wish that the gray was a bit less "brownish" of a color, though, as
it makes Prime looks a bit dirty on those pieces, and not in a good, "weathered
metal" way. The mold detailing on the toy is decent enough (though not
spectacular), and follows the game model pretty well what with the different
panels and basic lines and whatnot. His paint apps are a tad sparse-- his
windows, chest, wheels, and what become his kneecaps in robot mode are
painted here, but his front bumper in particular needed some paint (headlights,
anyone?). Given the "bright energy lines" aesthetic that goes with many
of the WfC/FoC designs, him not having any of those sort of paint apps
feels a bit lacking, as well. His wheels are also "clip-on" instead of
pinned into the figure-- that bugs some people, but I don't mind it. Optimus'
gun can be stored in one of four places in this mode-- either on the top,
slightly to one side given that they peg into what becomes the bottom of
the robot feet; or it can be mounted on either side, right above his rear
two wheels.

    Prime's transformation
to robot mode is remarkably simple (particularly compared with his WfC
toy), and more or less emulates his
    <a href="g1prime.html">
     G1 toy
    </a>
    transformation
with a couple of minor differences and additions. Thus we end up with a
bulkier, more simplstic Prime, but also one that doesn't really have a
bunch of truck parts hanging off of him, either. (Parts of his bumper hang
off the back end of his lower arms, and his wheels are a touch unsightly
on the inside of said lower arms, but that's it.) He's got a barrel chest,
but other than that minor downside his proportions are quite good, and
the detailing on his robot parts-- particularly his head sculpt-- is considerably
better and finer than the detailing of his vehicle parts. For articulation,
Optimus can move at the head, shoulders (at two points), elbows, rotational
movement at the wrists and waist (well, stomach, really), and movement
at the hips (at two points), knees, and at the ankles (at two points).
Combined with his lack of back-heaviness, that means you can put him into
some pretty nice poses-- the only thing really missing is a sideways joint
at his knees, really. As expected, you can store Prime's gun in either
of his fist holes, though it can also be plugged into one of the holes
on the side of his lower arms, or the aforementioned holes on the sides
of his blue legs.

    FoC Optimus Prime is
certainly a more simplistic and lighter/smaller Transformer than we've
gotten up to this point in the Generations line, but good proportions,
few extras, and a great amount of articulation make his robot mode great.
His vehicle mode is a bit more iffy given the hollow back end and obvious
feet, but for the most part it's still decent enough. Recommended if you
want a "game-verse" Prime that's easy to transform; mildly recommended
otherwise.

      Confronted with the inevitable decline
of his homeworld into a long period of frozen, powerless hibernation, Optimus
Prime faces a terrible choice: Stay and fight to the finish, only to fall
into stasis alongside his world; or evacuate, and hope the Decepticons
pursue him into space so that the planet has time to heal.
