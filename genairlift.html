    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Overcast. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Overcast

     Diverging from the previous
deco jobs this mold has had, this version of the mold as a discount store,
single-packed toy gets a rather realistic color scheme that's primarily
gray with a fair amount of black, as well (particularly on the missiles).
The gray itself, thankfully, isn't that really blah light milky shade of
the color, though it's not exactly exciting either (being flat). However,
this said, Airlift's paint apps are what take this repaint from being REALLY
dull to actually being decent. The black paint apps on the turbines and
the nosecone help things a little, but there's a couple of dots of bright
yellow and red paint apps on the toy. The yellow is on the "headlights"
on the wings, while the red is on the cockpit windows, the end of each
wing, and on the robot head visor. Other than this, Airlift has no other
real color to him, but given how evenly spaced these colored paint apps
are across the mold, it actually makes him pop visually more than you'd
think from a description (the yellow, in particular). A little bit of an
additional, odd note here is that although Airlift's packaging calls him
a Decepticon, the toy itself bears no such allegiance symbol, but simply
a Minicon symbol on his right wing.

     Airlift is a redeco
for those who like more realistic paint jobs on their figures compared
to those who prefer paint jobs that "pop" or even remotely approach loud
(both of this mold's previous deco jobs had purple as a major color, for
example). I personally think that Airlift is the most boring out of the
different releases of this mold, but the couple of well-spaced paint apps
do up my opinion of him slightly more than if he were just entirely gray
and black.
