    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Dead End.

     C'mon, you knew they
weren't going to create a new head mold for
     <a href="cwprowl.html">
      Prowl
     </a>
     and not use it again. Rounding out the mass-released versions of the CW
Dead End mold is Smokescreen, who, as you'd expect, has colors close to
his G1 version. His primary colors are red and blue-- the red is a rather
straightforward red, but the blue is a really nice shade of the color,
being a milky medium shade with a fair amount of glitter in the mix to
make it look semi-metallic. Both colors contrast against each other quite
well, with the red showing up more in vehicle mode and the blue in robot
mode. There's the usual white "38"s on the sides of the car doors and the
front hood, though due to the mold design and breakup, the car door 38s
are a bit smaller than usual and more towards the front of the car doors,
since the little sliver of plastic in the middle of the car doors is unpaintable.
With the exception of that unpaintable bit, there's also curvy white stripes
down the sides of the vehicle mode. The major departure from Smokescreen's
usual colors is that much of the gray that's usually on his upper arms
and upper legs is gone, replaced with more blue or red. Even some small
parts like the windows, waist, exhaust pipe, and combiner port are black--
an okay color, but a bit dark against the blue and not as nice as a metallic
gray or silver would've looked. It's a shame, since Smokescreen really
needs some more paint in robot mode-- he's almost all two colors, with
the legs being especially bad, being nearly all-blue except for the kneecaps
and wheels. His rear end in car mode is also completely unpainted, and
his front bumper almost unpainted except for the red on the top that seems
to ignore the mold detailing. At least the silver paint on Smokescreen
is used on his shotgun weapon, as well as his face and his wheel hubs.
There's also just a touch of yellow on Smokescreen's headcrest to complete
his traditional look there.

     Smokescreen has the
same "reshelling" done to the mold that
     <a href="cwstreetwise.html">
      Streetwise
     </a>
     has, as well as the same headsculpt as Prowl-- however, he has no mold
changes specific to this release. This is a shame for the vehicle mode,
given that the sirens are still there, even though Smokescreen's supposed
to be a non-police sportscar.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although this mold is
one of my favorites no matter how many times it's released, I have mixed
feelings about Smokescreen's paint job. On the one hand, he is certainly
more colorful than the other mass-release toys sharing this mold detailing,
and the curvy look of the vehicle mode fits a sportscar better. On the
other hand, there needed to be some metallic gray or silver in robot mode
to break up all that blue and red better-- as it is, despite all the paint
on the top of his vehicle mode, Smokescreen still looks bare on the front
and back of said vehicle mode as well as on much of his robot mode. The
sirens also don't fit his vehicle mode at all. Overall he ranks a little
below CW Prowl because of these couple of mold oddities and lack of paint
apps in vital areas, despite being more colorful.

       Smokescreen is the resident fixer for
the Autobots; when a fight goes wrong, he cleans up the mess. Using an
array of disruptive and disorienting weapons, Smokescreen confuses his
enemies and obscures his allies as they regroup for a punishing counterattack.

        As often as the Autobots rush headlong
into conflict, they need more bots like Smokescreen who specialize in getting
teammates out of danger. Brave and cunning, he's the Autobot sent into
battle when things are at their worst. Smokescreen has crafted an entire
arsenal of weapons designed to confound the enemy and save his comrades.
His heavy-grenade launcher fires shells that emit magnetic smoke that clings
to adversaries, and his shock club disrupts radar and sonar waves while
shorting out electrical systems. By the time the enemy gets their senses
back, Smokescreen and the Autobots are long gone.

         Smokescreen is one of the most underappreciated
Autobots, as his specific talents are usually unleashed in battles that
have been already lost. His most heroic moments are covered by the din
of battle and hidden by his own smoke. A critical member of the Autobot
forces, it's no surprise Smokescreen was chosen as part of the new Combiner
team. Forms either the arm or leg of Sky Reign, the new combined form of
Sky Lynx.
