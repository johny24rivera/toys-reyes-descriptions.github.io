    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Rampage Transmetal. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Rampage Transmetal
    <a href="rampage.html">

     Although Rampage was
still a pretty good toy, Shokaract takes that same toy and improves upon
it, adding a much darker color scheme. The dark metallic blue and black
definitely give Shokaract an evil feeling, and for good reason- Shokaract
is nearly a dark god in the BotCon 2000 comic. The copper and metallic
brown also give Shokaract the coloring of a real crab in those areas, especially
in robot mode, making him look more "organic" in robot mode than his predecessor
Rampage did. The paint detailing and color fading is exquisite, especially
in robot mode. One thing I don't like, however, is that Shokaract's missles
and cannon are both the same color, just like Rampage's missles and cannon,
unfortunately. This monotonous color combination blurs the line where the
cannon ends and the missles begin. Paint detailing or something would have
been appreciated here. No mold changes were made to this toy, so Shokaract
otherwise shares all the flaws and features that the Rampage Transmetal
toy did.

     A great toy, and, in
my opinion, better than Rampage. However, it's pretty pricey, so unless
you're a completist, I'd just get Rampage if I were you.

       Not since the days of the Dark God,
Unicron, has the universe felt such a presence of evil. Once a lowly Predacon
warrior, Shokaract stumbled upon the life force of the Dark God during
a failed recon mission. Fashioning a housing for this Dark Essence, Shokaract
called it his Decepticon Matrix of Conquest. Serving as a mockery of the
Autobot Matrix of Leadership, the vessel that destroyed Unicron in 2005,
the mere mention of this Matrix of Conquest would instill fear into the
Spark of every Transformer for centuries to come. Shokaract's goal is frighteningly
simple - the subjugation of the entire universe. His only opposition is
pockets of resistance spread throughout the galaxy, attacking his Herald-led
armies at every opportunity. With the Matrix of Conquest in his possession,
Shokaract has no weaknesses.
