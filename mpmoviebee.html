    Even though this toy
is technically a toy for the 2007 movie, it was released during
    <i>
     The
Last Knight
    </i>
    in 2017 for the movie universe's 10th anniversary-- hence
why I'm reviewing it in "The Last Knight" section. Anyways, in vehicle
mode, as you'd expect particularly from a Masterpiece with an alt mode,
it's pretty flawless. The proportions are completely spot-on in every respect
to the 2008 "Concept Camaro" model used for TF1, and kibble-wise things
are pretty minimal. There's just a teeny bit of Bumblebee's ankles you
can see on the back end below the main bumper, and from a straight side-on
view a couple of his robot pieces underneath the body of the car, but they
just barely stick out and don't interfere with rolling him on his tires
(which are plastic, not rubbery). Since this is a Masterpiece toy, everything
on the car is detailed pretty exactly. The two stripes with small borders
around them are certainly accurately on the front hood and back bumper,
and all of the minor details-- from the small red taillights and license
plate near the back end to the door handles to the "CAMARO" logo on the
sides-- are all appropriately colored. The front grill has headlights that
are a light shade of blue; otherwise the windows and other transparent
plastic is all a pretty straightforward clear color. Unfortunately, there
wasn't an attempt made to make the interior of the car realistic-- open
up the side doors (and the rear side windows with them) and you'll just
find a bunch of robot parts inside, which is a bit of a shame. The wheel
hubs have a rather shiny, dark metallic gunmetal gray paint on them, rather
than the more straightforward silver you'd see on them on other Bumblebee
toys. It honestly has a bit more of a "car finish"-y look to it, so I like
the change. The main yellow plastic, however, is a more straightforward,
slightly dull shade of the color (not orangish like on many of his other
toys), looking very much like plastic and not like a car toy finish. Still,
the painted yellow parts match up great with the plastic pars, so that's
always good.

    Transforming Bumblebee
to robot mode, as you'd expect from a Masterpiece toy, is quite complex.
The upper body isn't TOO intricate, mostly following the basic steps from
your average movie 'Bee toy, but adding in some smaller little extra bits,
like the folding down of the rear side windows to make a more complete,
accurate "four-wing" look behind his main body and adding little thin faux
bumper parts above his chest. The unfolding of the rear of the car mode
into his legs is more complex, but also more impressive, with some pretty
cool accordion-ing of parts and even adding little bits like the sides
of his rear ankles. The end result is fantastic, with very little not accurate
to the movie model. His main body probably goes a teeny bit further back
than you'd expect behind his head, and the little panels connected to his
front wheels aren't really accurate, and there's some minor bits sticking
out on his legs, but that's it. Every piece of kibble here is so minor
I wouldn't even bother mentioning it if this was a mainline toy. It's especially
nice to see his arms completely kibble-free-- no body panels on the back
of them or anything. His entire windshield and roof accordion up rather
impressively to form the mass of his main body, and yes, there is a little
peg hole on the back end if you have an appropriate display stand and want
to have him in an aerial jumping pose or something. The chest does crumple
up a little TOO much-- it's a tad too narrow-- but otherwise the main body
looks good, and the head is very accurately detailed, with blue eyes and
his flip-down mask. (That said, simply because of well-- reality-- having
the mask there makes his head look a bit bigger on the top when it's retracted.)
You can also attach a cannon piece around either of his lower arms, by
rotating the hand in and then flipping the cannon piece over the stump.
(The cannon piece stores on his butt if you don't want it on his arm in
this mode, and it stores split in two below the body of the vehicle.) There's
also some nice diecast on his lower legs to give him extra mass down there--
which is good, as he's slightly back-heavy, and the diecast on his lower
doors would definitely have made him unstable without the metal on his
legs, too. The mold detailing is all completely accurate to the movie,
and paint is used where appropriate-- from silver on the arms to some darker
gunmetal gray on some of his other robot parts, to the faux "broken" license
plate on his pelvis. Articulation is exquisite; he can move at the neck,
at the base of each of those smaller faux vehicle pieces above his chest,
at each pec, at the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
wrists (at two points), at the base and mid-point of each thumb, index
finger, and his smaller two fingers (the two fingers as one piece at each
point), waist rotation, movement at the hips (at two points), knees (two
points), ankle (two points), and a bit of movement at the toes and each
heel spur. Really, you can't ask for anything better. The slight back-heaviness
is the only real limit on his poseability.

    Sure, Masterpiece Movie
Bumblebee is quite expensive for the size (somewhere between voyager and
leader class), but you get what you pay for. He's exquisitely detailed
in each mode, with stellar proportions, very minimal kibble in either mode
(at least that's not on his model), some neat extras like the mask and
cannon (without going overboard like some Takara MP releases), amazing
articulation... The only real downside for me is that his vehicle mode
doesn't have a realistic interior. If you're a collector and don't mind
spending a decent amount of both money and time for the transformation,
this is definitely the movie 'Bee toy for you.
