    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Bulkhead. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Bulkhead

     Quickstrike is one of
the best repaints of the Energon line, hands down. He's such a BIG improvement
over Bulkhead, I can't fathom how I gave Bulkhead a 9.2... I guess I was
so enthused about the new mold I overlooked the colors easier. But regardless,
it's aaallll in the past. Quickstrike blows his predecessor out of the
water. Red, black, and silver is a KICKING color scheme, and there aren't
any peculiar shades of those colors on this toy, either; the red is a pure
red, the black a pure black, and the silver a shiny silver. It really gives
off a serious, somewhat dark Autobot vibe. Plus, his drone has the same
color scheme as Quickstrike himself does, so their colors don't clash when
they're combined anymore. Now, granted, Quickstrike doesn't have as many
different colors on him as Bulkhead does, but sometimes the simplest color
schemes look the best. Plus, Quickstrike's got several more paint apps
on him than Bulkhead-- his silver, black, and gold legs I've positively
DROOLED over. I also really like the white-and-teal paint apps that are
most prominently visible in his helicopter mode. It gives Quickstike a
bit of a "rescue copter" vibe, what with those blue symbols and Japanese
writing and all. (Though actually, I don't really know WHY Quickstrike
has Japanese writing on him... I don't think the paint job on this toy
was ever released in Japan...)

     No mold changes have
been made to Quickstrike-- so unfortunately, his "firing" sound effect
still goes off far too easily in his combined mode. But his legs do seem
much sturdier, at least on my toy, so he can support himself in combined
mode better.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Quickstrike is an absolutely
fantastic repaint of an already great mold. HIGHLY recommended if you can
find him-- he easily wins out over Bulkhead.

       Quickstrike is one of Optimus Prime's
greatest offensive strategists. His brilliant attack patterns have earned
the Autobots many victories against the Decepticons. In helicopter mode,
his speed and maneuverability are matched only by his cousin Bulkhead.
Unlike Bulkhead, Quickstrike will never enter a conflict without a well-devised
plan of attack. He likes to get in and out during an offensive and avoids
brawling whenever possible. Megatron regards Quickstrike as a dangerous
threat and has offered a substantial reward to any Decepticon that can
hunt down and destroy him. First, they'll have to catch him.
