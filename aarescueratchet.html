    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the deluxe version of Revenge
of the Fallen Ratchet. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Like the previous
     <a href="rescueratchet.html">
      "Rescue
Ratchet" movie redeco
     </a>
     , this version of Ratchet now gives the G1 color
scheme to the deluxe version of the mold. Generally, my comments about
this color scheme are the same as any color scheme involving red, white,
and black/gray-- it works fairly well, and though it's not the most original
color scheme in the world, it's certainly effective on an ambulance and
looks nice. Compared to the previous Rescue Ratchet movie deco job, though,
I think the paint apps on this one are a little inferior. There's just
a plain red stripe on the side of this version with "RESCUE" imprinted
near the back end of said stripe-- certainly nothing really eye-catching
or unusual. I'm also starting to miss the "heartbeat spike" in the lines
on the sides of the toy, as that's become so big a part of Ratchet's look
in recent years. One thing I do like about this version over the previous
movie Rescue Ratchet is the increased amount of black, which helps give
a bit more color variation and contrast to the toy, particularly in vehicle
mode. The transparent blue windows, headlights, optics, and missile also
look quite nice, and there's a bit more red on the toy as well (particularly
visible in robot mode), which keeps him from being too one-tone with the
white.

     No mold changes have
been made to Rescue Ratchet.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Rescue Ratchet is about
what you'd expect from a G1-themed redeco of the mold, though they're still
mixing it up a little from the Voyager class Rescue Ratchet deco, at least.
Compared to that previous version, I like that this one has a greater amount
of black and red (which is also a little darker for contrast on this version),
but this one's paint apps are a bit more plain. Overall I'd recommend this
over the original release of this mold, though.

       Autobot Ratchet has years of fighting
experience, but there are dozens of ways to improvise in a battle that
would never occur to him. Luckily, he's teamed up with Highbrow, who can
suggest twenty ways to use a laser scalpel to cripple a Decepticon-- even
one as powerful as The Fallen.
