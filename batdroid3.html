    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Battle
Droid. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
SWTF Battle Droid

     Apparently not satisfied
with two different versions of the Battle Droid/AAT mold, a third one has
been released, and like the
     <a href="batdroid2.html">
      second one
     </a>
     , it's
also brown-- but this time around, it's a much darker, less tannish shade
of brown. The two main colors in both modes tend to be a rather nice mix
of dull reddish brown and a more straightforward muddy brown. This sounds
more boring than it is-- as one can see above, there's a very intricate
pattern of the dull reddish brown on the (mostly) light brown plastic.
It makes for a very interesting deco job, particularly in vehicle mode
where the stripes and symbols help ensure there's no place even remotely
large on this figure that's all one color. That's not to say that brown
is it on this toy, though-- there's also some nice yellow and black highlights--
particularly prevalent in mech mode-- that help add a bit more color to
this version of the Battle Droid Commander. The only color choice I'm not
enamored with is the oddly pinkish shade of pale light red used for most
of the Battle Droid's "robot parts", i.e. his legs and arms in mech mode.
It complements the other main colors okay, I suppose, but it looks like
the droid went out to the beath and sunburned itself-- it's not the appropriate
color for a droid, and that's even ignoring why it's pink in this line,
of all lines-- a line known for sticking to a couple of basic colors for
nearly all of its releases.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of the Battle Droid Commander.

     The dark brown Battle
Droid Commander redeco is tied with the initial release for my favorite
version of the mold-- although I think the original's color scheme of blue
and green pops more on a shelf full of toys from the line, this version
is less dull than the second tan release while still keeping the main colors
brown, as a Battle Droid should be. Not too sure about the salmon pink
in mech mode, but if you want a version of the mold that isn't boring AND
fits in well with most other SWTFs on a shelf, this is the version to get.
