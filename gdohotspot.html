not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Inferno. For

     Hot Spot gets updated
in a non-combining form, though they picked a spot-on vehicle mode for
him. Even better, the baby/light blue that makes up most of Hot Spot's
color scheme looks VERY nice and is quite attractive. There's a fair number
of black parts too like his windows, feet, gun, and wheels to provide a
nice dark contast color against the blue. Which is good-- all that baby
blue by itself would've looked a tad loud for a Transformer. Having the
windows painted black, unfortunately, means that you can't see the seats
inside, but I think the solid black windows look better against the blue
than any transparent color would have, and makes his chest look more "solid"
in robot mode. There's also some dark brownish gray used for a few parts
like his upper legs and front bumper-- I wish this had been a straighter
black, but it still works decent enough with the other colors. And speaking
of other colors, Hot Spot has PLENTY as accents; the red sirens, the "fireball"
emblems on the sides, several details painted silver on his sides and front
bumper, his headlights being colored two different colors (that are used
nowhere else on the toy); this is most definitely NOT a toy that looks
boring, particularly in vehicle mode-- admittedly a few more paint apps
on his appendages in robot mode would've broken up all that blue better.
Plus, none of the colors (even the tiniest accents) clash, which is awesome.

     Hot Spot gets a new
headsculpt for the mold, very much inspired by his G1 head but a bit more
angular and modern-looking, with a determined look to him. The faceplate,
red eyes, and black helmet look quite good, and the sculpt is crisp-- no
complaints here. Other than the headsculpt though, Hot Spot doesn't have
any mold changes when compared to Universe 2.0 Inferno.

     "GDO" Generations Hot
Spot takes a great mold and gives it a fantastic, eye-catching color scheme
with a ton of paint apps to make him anything but dull-looking. True, he
has had a combining version of him come out now, but I honestly think the
color deco and vehicle mode of this release look better. If the inability
to combine doesn't bother you, I'd highly recommend this toy-- it's my
favorite deco job out of all the uses this mold has gotten.

       Protectobot Hot Spot strives to be the
best leader he can be. He refuses to ask those under his command to do
anything he would not do himself. No matter the situation, he will always
be found at the head of his soldiers, his voice calling loudly above the
battle, and his cannons blazing.
