    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Brakedown.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     Dead End is, like RotF
Brakedown, an homage to a G1 Stunticon, but although the bio is a dead
ringer for G1 Dead End's, the color scheme is not. The color scheme, in
fact, is an homage to another Stunticon, Wildrider-- I'm guessing he wasn't
named that because of copyright issues. The main colors are various dark
or semi-dark colors of gray along with various shades of red-- and they
all go together quite well. The burgundy red windows in vehicle mode, along
with the stripes along the sides, really help to make that mode pop in
a rather evil, "Decepticon-y" way, though those aren't the only colors.
Silver headlights and wheel hubs, gold taillights, and a bit of black here
and there help to round out Dead End's overall color scheme. In robot mode
the colors are even more varied, with the light red paint complementing
the duller red plastic pretty well and bringing a lighter color to Dead
End's scheme (at least in a prominent manner). There's also a bit of that
bland, ugly light milky gray that comes into play on Dead End's robot mode
legs, but that's a minor complaint. The back end/bumper and head's color
layout is particularly good and varied in robot mode, with all of Dead
End's various colors in play in a relatively small place. The red face
and gold eyes look especially nice and evil-looking.

     No mold changes have
been made to GDO Dead End.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     GDO Dead End has a pretty
nice color scheme that hearkens back to the G1 Stunticon Wildrider in all
the right ways, looking visually attractive color-wise in both modes. It's
a pretty mediocre mold, unfortunately, but out of the different color schemes
this mold has had, this one is the best by a hair, from my point of view,
keeping the colors varied up enough to keep any large spot on the toy from
looking boring.

       Dead End is capable of amazing feats
of speed and fighting prowess-- he just doesn't see the point. He can always
be found hidden in a dark corner somewhere, grumbling, polishing his armor,
and wishing everyone else would go away and leave him alone.
