    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Bumper Battler
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Bumblebee's "Sting Racer"
is probably one of the most pointless Animated repaints ever, particularly
for a mass-release and not some store exclusive half-repaint. Basically
his color scheme is slightly more "electric-y", with his black stripe down
one side instead being replaced with a more jagged electric blue "lightning
stripe". His windows are also a very dark shade of electric blue, and his
yellow has just a tinge of bluish shading to it. He also has more jagged
electric blue lines on his sides, and his stylized "Bumblebee" logo is
now in electric blue as well. I understand they want to keep yellow associated
with Bumblebee, but THIS little of a change? Really? One cool difference
with the robot mode, though, is that his mouth-- which is painted on, not
molded-in-- is in a different kind of smirky expression, which is rather
inventive.

     No mold changes have
been made to Sting Racer Bumblebee. However, surprisingly, many of his
electronic sounds have been changed from the previous version. As can be
seen fron the list of sounds below, some are the same, but there are definitely
some different phrases for the Sting Racer variant:
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Engine revving up" noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Tires screeching" noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Electric blasts" noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -Slightly different "electric blast" noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -Grunting noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -Transforming noise
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Ow!"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Wanna race?"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -Laughing (same as the original Bumper
Battler)
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"I'm Bumblebee."
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Let's go."
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">

    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"This calls for speed!"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Bring it on, Decepticons!"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"You're going dooooown!"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     -"Not the racing stripes!"
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Overall, I'd only get
Sting Racer Bumblebee if A. You already like the Bumper Battler concept
and B. The sounds are what do it for you way more than the toy itself.
The toy is barely different, and though I sorta like the "electric" theme,
I think it's a bit too bright with not enough dark contrasting colors.
If you're going to get one version of this mold, make it the original.

       Racing into danger at top speed, Bumblebee
blasts electric stingers at every bad guy he sees. He may be the smallest
member of the Autobot crew, but he's also the fastest, and his stingers
pack enough punch to put down almost any bad guy!
