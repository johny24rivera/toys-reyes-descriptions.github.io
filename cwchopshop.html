    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Skrapnel.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Legends

     , Chop Shop now makes
his premiere at the "full-fledged" Legends scale, as a remold of Skrapnel--
which makes sense, since although they were different molds, they had similar
beast modes in G1. Literally all of Chop Shop's plastic is a dark rusty
brown; it's not a bad color at all, but using it for ALL of the plastic?
Hasbro couldn't have varied it up a bit more on the arms or insect legs
or something? There's some paint on most of Chop Shop's other parts, though,
like his orange-painted chest with rather unique white "hook" details on
the sides of the chest. The lower legs in robot mode are also painted this
same shade of orange, though this is mostly hidden in beast mode because
of the transformation. The orange is a great shade of the color, both contrasting
against and complementing the rusty brown. There's also silver on the vents
on the top rear of the bug mode, so at least there's another color back
there regardless. As a final little accent color, Chop Shop has dark dull
fuchsia paint used on the sides of his chest, for his insect "eyes". Unfortunately,
this color is so dull it doesn't really stand out against the brown much;
I would've preferred that a lighter color had been used.

     Chop Shop has a new
headsculpt, very much inline with his G1 sculpt but a little more detailed.
He's got his antennae, as well as the mouthplate-- it all certainly looks
very bug-like. It's well-painted too, with the antennae and sides being
painted orange, the center crest being painted silver, and the eyes being
painted fuchsia (though again, it doesn't come through well on the brown
plastic). Additionally, like the other Combiner Wars Legends that have
been remolded or repainted from the "Thrilling 30th" Legends 2-packs, Chop
Shop doesn't come with a little partner toy. Awww.

     Combiner Wars Chop Shop
is appreciated as a larger upgrade to an Insecticon outside of the "normal
three", but he's got entirely too much rusty brown plastic and not enough
paint apps to go around, particularly on his insect legs/mandibles and
robot arms. Most of the paint apps that he does have look fairly nice,
though the fuchsia should've been lighter. I think Skrapnel is the more
interesting-looking version of this mold, but if you want a more unconventional
(or realistic-colored) choice, this is a nice little mold. (I wish other
G1 Deluxe Insecticon updates had been released around the same time, though...
Chop Shop's very much a loner at this point in time...)
