    This time around General
Grevious has an alternate mode of his own Starfighter, and I have to say
it looks pretty boss. Unless you look at him from the bottom (where you
can see some of his upper legs and waist), he has no robot mode extras
whatsoever, which is pretty much par for the course as far as this line
goes. The vehicle mode proportions are also pretty much perfect, and all
the appropriate mold detailing is there. The gold and alternating gold/bronze
patterns really look swell and add immensely to the contrast, though the
rear section could use a tad of paint. There's no real weapons that can
be used in this mode, however, and although the cockpit opens up, because
this is part of the Clone Wars "Crossover" part of the SWTF line, there's
no mini Grevious pilot figure to fit in it. He does have two fold-down
landing gear bits, though, and they're surprisingly intricate, which is
a nice touch.

    Grevious' Mech mode
is, sadly, another SWTF that is a complete shell-former. The cockpit forms
the chest and the arms are formed out of a small part of the vehicle mode
chassis, but other than that almost every other part of Grevious' vehicle
mode is swung behind his chest. It REALLY kills the look of the mode, that
much kibble just dwarfs everything else about him. They also don't really
peg in anywhere, either. On the plus side, the paint applications and detailing
on the waist and legs are really, really well-done-- to the point where
it seems like all the paint was transferred there and barely used on most
of the other parts of the figure. I also like his shoulder pads-- THAT'S
how you use vehicle mode parts, folks-- and in general his core Mech mode
proportions are pretty good. The arms are overly skinny and stiff-looking,
however. The face is pretty much straight-on General Grevious, without
any more "mechanized" pieces, though he's pretty robotic to begin with.
It does look out-of-place compared to the coloring of most of the rest
of him, though, like he's wearing a long-sleeved shirt or something. As
far as articulation goes, Grevious can move at the neck, shoulders (at
three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips (at two points), knees
(at two points), and ankles (at four points). However, this seems like
a lot more than it is, due to the huge backpack that makes him rather back-heavy
and gets in the way of a lot of movement. His "chicken-walker" ankles give
him a bit more stability than he otherwise would have, though. And, as
you'd expect with General Grevious, he has two lightsabers which can be
held in his hands-- though they can also be stored in his large backpack,
which is nice.

    The Starfighter version
of General Grevious has an awesome vehicle mode which is pretty much flawless--
but on the flipside, his Mech mode has a huuuuge backpack of kibble and
really skinny, stiff arms to boot. Other than his ability so stay together
better, his Mech mode is inferior to the

SWTF Grevious'
    </a>
    in every way. A better vehicle mode just isn't worth
it, in my opinion-- not recommended unless you're a huge Greviosu fan.

      General Grievous has fought many enemies
in the Clone Wars, but none has been so difficult to defeat as Obi-Wan
Kenobi. Every duel has ended with Grievous on the run and the Jedi still
alive. Piloting his starfighter, Grievous launches an all-out attack against
Obi-Wan then morphs into mech mode to defeat the Jedi once and for all!
