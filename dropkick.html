    Dropkick is another toy
released in the mainline that is based on one of the drones from the main
console version of the
    <a href="tfmovieps2.html">
     Transformers Movie video
game
    </a>
    . His vehicle mode is a pickup truck, with the bed filled up (though
Dropkick's claw weapon in robot mode, which is formed from said filled
truck bed, can be taken out if you want Dropkick's bed to be open in this
mode). This mode is very nice-- the proportions are pretty much spot-on,
with a large front bumper and a pretty sturdy look to the vehicle. There's
no robot mode extras to speak of, with the exception of the parts that
can be seen through the clear plastic windows (no detailed interior here).
The color scheme of gray and purple is fairly simple, yet very "Decepticon-y",
even if it's not particularly realistic for a truck. The silver-and-purple
stripes paint apps on the sides I especially like. What really makes Dropkick
stand out in this mode is a HUGE Decepticon symbol that takes up the front
half of this entire mode. Normally I don't like big allegiance symbols,
but this isn't not obvious at first, and the silver stripes worth surprisingly
well as just a general pattern on the front hood and roof. The headlights
and taillights are made of little bits of transparent plastic-- quite a
surprise at this scale, and well-appreciated-- though the bumpers could
REALLY use some paint apps.

    Dropkick's robot mode
is very good, though he has the wrong drone face-- instead of the Decepticon
"lens face" that all Deceptidrones had in the video game, he has the generic
Autodrone face with a faceplate. I guess Hasbro wanted to mix up the face
molds a bit more, or it was just decided relatively late in production
to make Dropkick a Decepticon to further bolster their ranks (which I'm
totally cool with-- can never have too many Decepticons)! First, the few
bad things about this mode-- Dropkick has a TON of shoulder kibble. His
wheel bits above his shoulders aren't bad, and his doors on his shoulders
look like wings, but having two MORE truck panels sticking out from behind
those doors is a bit overkill in my opinion, as it restricts movement there
somewhat and just makes him look a little unbalanced (though he actually
stands up by himself very well, due to his leg design). There is a little
bit of truck kibble on his back and the sides of his hands that is just
blatantly kibble as well, and doesn't really accentuate the look of this
mode. Dropkick's claw weapon, while somewhat cool (turn the dial to open
and close the claw, or just manually open and close the claw yourself),
is rather oversized for a deluxe class toy. Also, the pegs that hold his
shoulders to his main body are rather shallow, and become unpegged way
too easily. There's plenty of good stuff to offset the couple of bad things,
though-- Dropkick is EXTREMELY well-detailed in this mode, particularly
when it comes to mold detailing but also paint detailing as well. (I especially
like the metallic teal lines on his faceplate.) Suspension springs, "headlights"
on his pelvis, cylinders, and more cover Dropkick's robot parts. His proportions
are also pretty good (though his arms are a tad on the skinny side), and
he's one of the movie toys not actually in the movie that looks the most
like he actually WAS in the movie, even in a simplfied toy design. For
one, he's got alien features, such as his face design and his "chicken-walker"
legs, and "fiddly bits" that don't really serve any necessary purpose in
robot mode, but just make him fit in more with the movie aesthetic by making
him look more complex (two examples are the antennae on the sides of his
neck and the small, proportionally long pieces of plastic above his heels).
Having his truck windows stick out a bit from his very detailed chest and
"fake truck parts" in this mode like the headlights on his pelvis also
scream "movie toy", as well. Oh, and he has wrist guns. Gotta love those.
In addition, Dropkick's transformation is extremely innovative and interesting,
but without being overly complex and frustrating. Dropkick also has fairly
good articulation-- he can move at the neck, shoulders, shoulders, waist,
hips, knees (at three points), and ankle movement, though as I mentioned
before, his arm articulation can be limited a bit by all his shoulder kibble.

    Dropkick is a great
toy, one of the best movie toys that wasn't actually a character in the
movie. He does have some kibble problems in robot mode, but given his incredibly
innovative transformation, unique look, great proportions, and solid vehicle
mode, that's easily overlooked. If only he had slightly less kibble, or
if his shoulders pegged together better, that'd be just enough to edge
him into the "must-buy" rating of 9.0+, but he's pretty darned close to
that rating as is and a recommended purchase.

      Dropkick didn't want to come to Earth,
but Megatron made him. He'd rather stay home on Cybertron, sitting in the
dark and being angry, but Megatron has him hauling materials all over this
lame planet. He doesnt' even know why the AllSpark is so important, or
why the Autobots need to be getting in his way all the time. He just wishes
everyone would leave him alone. Still, while he's here, he might as well
blow some stuff up. That's always fun.
