    Optimus Prime's truck
cab mode is replicated surprisingly well for such a small-scale toy, with
no robot extras whatsoever in this mode. The only thing that this mode
seems to suffer from design-wise is that the rear hauler portion of the
truck is way too short proportionally, which looks rather odd. Other than
that, this mode is pretty solid. The colors are duller than on the other
versions of Movie Prime, for some reason-- usually the red is a light shade,
but it's a dark, dull shade on this toy. It still goes very well with the
dark blue, though, and Legends Prime has plenty of paint apps on the front
portion of this mode-- the flame paint apps are surprisingly detailed for
being so small, so they're especially impressive. The rear half of this
mode is completely lacking in paint apps, though, and it really could've
used a few as it doesn't have the color contrast that the front half does.
Oh, and he only has a smokestack on the left side of this mode-- what's
up with THAT?

    Prime's robot mode does
suffer a bit from being at this small of a scale. His arms are just molded
on the inside of part of his truck mode-- not something I'm really crazy
about, but something that is acceptable at this cale. Coupled with the
wide, flat chest, it makes Prime look a bit beefier than he actually is
in this movie, however. The robot arms are also completely devoid of paint
apps, which doesn't look so hot, though the well-done paint apps on the
chest and head partially make up for this. The legs are of a rather odd
construction, and are my main complaint with the toy-- having the knees
stick out so far ahead of the upper legs looks really weird, and he doesn't
really have any toes to speak of, either. (His wide, blocky lower legs
do make him pretty stable, though.) Another big downside to this mode is
that a hinge on his waist is really, really loose, to the point where his
waist comes undone all the time, which can obviously get rather annoying.
As far as articulation goes, Prime has about what you'd expect from a toy
this small-- he has ball-joint movement at the shoulders and hips, but
that's it.

    Legends Movie Prime
is about average as far as Legends class figures go-- he has one pretty
good mode (his vehicle mode), but his other mode suffers a bit from the
small scale (his robot mode). Unless you're a huge Prime fan, just spring
