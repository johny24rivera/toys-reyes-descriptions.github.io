    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Robots in Disguise 2001
"Super" Scourge. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Robots

     Where, here's a mold
I honestly never thought I'd see redecoed again. This mold was over 20
years old when it was redecoed into this "Platinum Edition" version, but
it still holds up as good as ever. This time around, Optimus Prime has
taken a more unique and unusual color scheme-- a color scheme that in some
respects homages the traditional "goat year" colors with the bronze. Many,
upon first seeing this toy, were worried about the bronze being ugly tan
plastic-- fear not, EVERY bit of bronze on this toy is painted, and a wonderful
metallic hue of the color at that-- yes, even the huge tower piece that
forms the center of the base mode. The black contrasts excellently with
said bronze, and the chrome silver finish on the wheels and sides of the
trailer is another great color, giving the toy a bit of a "premium" feel
as well. (As of this writing-- 2/17-- I have yet to hear of any issues
with the chrome cracking either, so that's always good.) "Goat" Optimus
Prime's other color choices aren't quite as good. The clear plastic is
an interesting color-- I like seeing the "innards" of the robot mode in
particular, and seeing the electronics and wires inside the main cab is
rather cool-- but it's used a bit too much here, and it's a rather drab
main color. No reason is given for why so much of his cab/robot portion
in particular is clear-- it's not like his bio mentions he's "reformatting"
or in "stealth armor" or anything. The accent colors are hit-and-miss;
the silver paint works nearly as well with all the metallic bronze as the
chrome silver on the few places it's used, such as on part of the top of
the cab. The yellow rooflights and robot eyes look quite good, even against
clear plastic. The silver-and-black Autobot symbols on Optimus are pretty
cool, being half normal Autobot symbol and half the Autobot symbol merged
with the symbol for goat. The light milky gray is of a slightly brownish
shade, making it both boring and a bit ugly to boot; thankfully it's not
used much. The transparent pink plastic used for the weapons-- the discs,
the pump-missiles, and the spring-loaded missiles-- is honestly a bizzare
color, and clashes with the bronze in particular. It's also not used on
the one area where it might have worked as an "energy weapon"-- namely,
Prime's sword, which is of the clear plastic variety. The light blue tips
of the pump-missiles are also an odd color choice, though that perhaps
can be chalked up to safety regulation issues.

     No mold changes have
been changed to "Year of the Goat" Optimus Prime-- thankfully he has his
red electronics intact as well, so his sword can light up pretty well.
That said, the push missile launchers on mine do not work in the slightest,
though this could just be my copy.

     "Year of the Goat" Optimus
Prime is an bit of an odd redeco, but the mold is still sturdy and holds
up well even under modern toy criteria, and is just a fun mold with a ton
of weaponry. The metallic bronze looks good too, and the clear plastic
helps make him look a bit more individualistic, if also a tad plain. Recommended
if you don't have a version of this awesome mold, and can get it for a
fair discount below the very hefty retail price tag.

       One sees these qualities in Optimus
Prime, whose group of heroic Autobots serves under his command. The people
of Earth know that they can always count on the Autobot leader to come
to their defense. He is calm in the face of danger, and unafraid to strike
back at those who threaten the peace he has long thought possible. He has
bravely survived thousands of years of war. That alone makes his legacy
a masterpiece.
