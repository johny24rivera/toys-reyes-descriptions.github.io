    Beast mode is a metallic
pterodactyl. This mode is one of the weakest beast modes ive seen, with
wings that can easily come off, and large claws that come out way too far
for a pterodactyls. His feet on his underside look nice, but can become
loose. His face looks nice and slender, though, and the detailing is pretty
good.

    Vehicle mode is a sort
of a turbine-powered pterodactyl. This mode is even weaker than the beast
mode, with almost nothing different except for his wing parts flipped back
to reveal turbines and his butt split open to reveal an engine like Infernos.

    Robot mode is the only
reason this robot didnt get below a 7.0. The robot mode, unlike the others,
is extremely cool-looking and a definite improvement over the old
    <a href="terrorsaur.html">
     Terrorsaur
    </a>
    robot mode. Although his head is extremely small in proportion to the rest
of his body, he has humongous claws that make him look fierce. His pterodactyl
butt in on his back, but it doesnt get in the way at all. His chest looks
sort of wodd, though, considering his pterodactyl head which comprises
it is folded in two. His feet have some sort of plungers on the bottom
of them that help him stand up, but they look a little bit odd. You can
detach the purple part of his wings and have him hold them in his hands
like boomerangs, but he can't hold them very well.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    If youre going to buy
this one, buy it for the robot mode, not the beast and vehicle modes.

      A quantum surge has altered the structure
of the tyrannical Terrorsaur, turning him into a jet-powered, vehicle-like
Pterodactyl with an unfettered rage for the Maximals. If Terrorsaur was
once known as fearless, his new armor has made him kamikaze. Hidden jet
thrusters leave a trail of fire in his wake and often ignite the terrain
below - a fact that tickles his twisted humor circuits endlessly. Fierce
talons and turbine spikes offer a dangerous arsenal that keep him involved
with his favorite activity: battling Maximals.
