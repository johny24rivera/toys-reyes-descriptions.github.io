    Ratchet's vehicle mode
is, predictably, an ambulance, though in fitting with the Animated style,
it's a bit more rounded and "cartoony" ambulance than has been traditionally
found in a Transformers line. His color scheme is pretty much a direct
homage from G1, being white, black, and red (with a touch of blue on the
windows). The white's a bit more of a grayish white this time, probably
to give him a bit more of an "old" look. It's not the most original color
scheme, but it works well and is appropriate. In fitting with the Animated
look, Ratchet also doesn't have much mold detailing, though the front bumper
and the "circuitry lines" in the front windshield are molded pretty well.
Ratchet's got his fair share of paint, as well, with no place looking too
barren of detailing. Ratchet's also got the "heartbeat" symbol on his sides
that was popularized by the Movie version of the character, which is another
cool nod. He doesn't have his sirens painted, though, which is a bit of
an oversight. The blue paint used for his windows also doesn't match his
translucent front windshield much-- I hate it when they combine painted
windows and translucent windows, either use one or the other! You can see
seats molded inside the front windshield, though there's zero leg room
so to be honest it's not very convincing. I do like how the taillights
are transparent though, that's a nice, unexpected touch. There's also no
robot mode extras whatsoever, which is of course always a good thing. I
do have one major beef about this mode, and that's that the four tools
that Ratchet comes with-- a wrench, a hammer, and two other tools I honestly
can't name-- can't store in this mode. And if you've been reading my reviews
for a while, you know I HATE parts that aren't storable in both modes.
Bleh.

    Ratchet's robot mode
just screams "old, worn out 'bot", which of course is exactly what Ratchet
is. The toy has tons of personality in this mode that wasn't apparent in
the other-- a bit of a "gut" formed from the crumped front of the ambulance,
an old, weathered face (though he looks so sad!), chunky arms, and a bit
of "battle damage"-- namely, one of his forehead crests has been "broken
off" and there's path on his left arm. If you watch the show, this patch
was where Ratchet's EMP generator went before it was stolen by Lockdown.
In fact, if you take the deluxe
    <a href="lockdown.html">
     Lockdown toy
    </a>
    and remove the EMP generator from it, it's SUPPOSED to fit in that patch.
Nice thinking, except it DOESN'T WORK. The slots are a perfect fit, EXCEPT
for some reason there's a raised peg on both the EMP generator and Ratchet's
arm patch, which means you can't attach the generator. Talk about a bummer
mold defect. Still, Ratchet does have his fair share of tools. First, the
four aforementioned tools can now be slid onto his upper back for storage,
or slid into his hands so he can "tinker" with other 'bots. If his hands
don't have any tools in them, his "magnets" from the show can also flip
up into his hands-- however, the spring-loaded feature sets off rather
easily, which is kind of annoying. Also, the "magnets" don't look a thing
like they do on the show, being only one uncolored black bar on each hand
versus the very obvious two-pronged colored magnets he uses in the show--
another missed opportunity. As far as vehicle mode kibble goes, Ratchet
has some-- namely, his collapsed-together roof pieces on his upper back
and the side panels on his shoulders-- but they don't get in the way of
movement, and the former folds away and out of sight. The panels stick
out rather obviously, but compared to how well the other vehicle mode parts
meld into this mode, it's easily forgiveable. Ratchet's articulation is
quite good-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows
(at two points), at the base of the thumb and at the base of each four
fingers (as one piece) on each hand, and at the hips (at three points)
and knees. His ankles can also move a little, as well, so you can get a
ton of great poses out of this guy-- the only major joint that's missing
is a waist pivot.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Ratchet is a fine Animated
toy with tons of personality, though a bit unoriginal in his transformation.
Quite frankly the gimmicks detract from the toy and make the overall score
worse than it otherwise-- his "magnets" are lame and deploy too easily,
and his tools can't be stored in vehicle mode. If neither of those things
bother you, than this is a highly recommended purchase-- otherwise, only
mildly recommended.

      Autobot Ratchet was, at one time, one
of the most promising medical minds on Cybertron. After his experiences
with Lockdown though, all he wanted to do was disappear. An assignment
to a deep space repair crew was just what he was looking for. He never
wanted to be in the middle of a new war against Megatron, but if that's
where fate puts him, he'll do his best to keep his comrades safe and sound.
