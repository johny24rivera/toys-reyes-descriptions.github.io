    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a

     Same character,
same mold, different style-- that's this release of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the
Episode II Jedi Starfighter mold. Given the series' recent emphasis on
the Clone Wars, it was only a matter of time before a version of this popular
character came out in the Clone Wars' styling, and here it is. Even though
the base colors of red, black, and a bit of yellow are the same as on the
     <a href="obiwan2.html">
      original Episode II Jedi Starfighter Kenobi
     </a>
     toy, the patterns are slightly different-- there's more off-white in the
vehicle mode, and the yellow's a bit of a different shade. There's also
subtle differences in the paint apps near the center of the vehicle mode,
with generally a bit more detailing. In mech mode, though, the addition
of a rather blah creamsicle yellow-orange doesn't really fit well with
the rest of the colors, and unfortunately rather ruins the look of that
mode a bit.

     Obi-Wan gets a new head
mold in the Clone Wars styling, with the "hair" a bit more streamlined
than on the first release of this mold as this character. I think the cleaner
look works much better for the whole "robotic face" look, and it's detailed
quite well. However, as you've probably noticed by now, the entire interstellar
ring assembly has been removed from this release. Even though that assembly
was one big piece of kibble in robot mode, this practically HALVES the
amount of plastic you get for the same prices-- plus, the panels behind
Obi Wan have nothing to plug into now. I know inflation has caused Hasbro
to cut back a bit, but THIS much?! This is a pitiful amount of toy for
$16 U.S.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Although the Clone Wars
"update" of Obi-Wan sports a very nice colors scheme-- creamsicle orange
in mech mode excepted-- and a bit cooler detailing and head mold, it's
more than negated by the loss of roughly half the toy's mass while still
keeping the price the same. Get the original release of Obi-Wan in this
mold if you want a SWTF version of him-- this one just ain't worth the
money.
