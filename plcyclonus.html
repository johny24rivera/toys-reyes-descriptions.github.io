      Y'know, Powerlinx Crumplezone
would actually be an improvement over his original version if it wasn't
for that darned bright green. The black, gray, and brownish maroon really
go together, and themselves create a really dark, "down and dirty" feel
for Crumplezome. But then they had to go and ruin it by throwing in all
that bright green, which not only looks disgusting by itself, but does
not go with the other colors AT ALL and completely ruins any cool factor
Powerlinx Crumplezone's paint job had going for it.

      Most of Powerlinx Crumplezone's
color scheme is nice, but that bright green completely throws it off and
ruins him. Not recommended over the original version.

        My comments on Powerlinx
Cyclonus are pretty similar to that of Powerlinx Crumplezone's- his other
colors work well together, except for that ridiculous bright green. And
it's even more of a problem on Powerlinx Cyclonus, because said bright
green IS his primary color. It's supposed to be some kind of tribute to
G1 Springer, who was also green and had a helicopter alt mode, but he wasn't
BRIGHT green. In fact, now that I think of it, if the green had been darker,
it would have worked wonders on Cyclonus. But alas, that's not how it turned
out. At least the the gray paint wash on the bright green helps give it
a "worn" feeling, which fits the rest of the darker color scheme. The ugly
bright orange on Cyclonus' face is still there, but it actually looks good
on those couple of paint apps on his lower legs.

        No mold changes have
been made to Powerlinx Cyclonus, so he can still combine with those geared
Minicons and stuff.

        Powerlinx Cyclonus'
bright green detracts from what was already the worst of the Armada Decepticons.
If you want a new Decepticon, get ANYONE but this guy.
