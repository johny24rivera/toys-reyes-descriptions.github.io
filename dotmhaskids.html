      Elita-1 is a repaint
of RotF Human Alliance Arcee-- maddeningly enough, considering that the
design itself is for
      <a href="rotfchromia.html">
       RotF CHROMIA
      </a>
      , but it
seems like movieverse Elita-1's never going to get her own mold, unfortunately.
The light glittery purple used as the main color looks really spiffy, particularly
in contrast with the black. There's unfortunately also a fair amount of
that light milky gray on her which is really blah, but it actually doesn't
look as bad as it could be, what with the purple and black accenting it
so well. The silver paint apps-- such as on the engine and tailpipes--
are also a nice touch, and the bit of light sky blue used for her optics
also really pops against her face sculpt. That said, paint on her license
plate or on a few places on the front half of her bike mode would've been
appreciated.

        DotM Human Alliance Skids
follows his other toys from the line in terms of keeping his Chevy Spark
alt mode, but flipping the color scheme around so that's it's mostly black
with green stripes down the center of the vehicle mode. This looks quite
nice, as the light green contrasts exceedingly well with all that black.
There isn't much paint on the sides, but the bright green "CHEVROLET" words
&amp; signs on below the car doors keep them from being completely black.
The taillights are also painted with a dot of light red in the middle to
make them look more like they're "on", and Skids' license plate is a little
creative, saying "SK33DZ". The silver paint apps on places like the wheel
hubs and headlights also look nice against the black. In robot mode Skids
gets a bit more green, but it's more of a brighter, "Starburst-y" variation
of light green-- and it still looks great. This is especially the case
given the brownish gold paint and plastic on him, which contrasts excellently
with the black as well, but
        <i>
         particularly
        </i>
        the bright green. There's
also some light milky gray, but thankfully it's not TOO prevalent here,
and all the brownish gold, black, and bright green plastic help to draw
attention away from it.

Skids doesn't have any core mold changes, but this repaint does come with
a new version of the human character Sergeant Epps. It's fairly accurate
to how he really looks, and the blue-and-black uniform he's wearing looks
nice. Epps shares the standard movement and articulation that all Human
Alliance partner figures do.

          Epps is used to mentoring younger soldiers,
so it only makes sense that he would be assigned to train Autobot Skids
in the ways of war on Earth. Given that both the human soldier and the
Autobot warrior share a passion for putting the hurt on Decepticons, it
was inevitable they would become friends and battlefield partners.

          The Dark of the Moon
redeco of Human Alliance Skids gives an already incredibly well-engineered
mold a dynamite, eye-catching paint job. Elita-1 looks fairly pretty color-wise
as well, though that mold is still pretty iffy at best. Overall, my highest-recommended
figure from the DotM Human Alliance subline.
