    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Strongarm toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 legion Strongarm

     Patrol Strongarm is essentially
Strongarm in black-- given that white is already part of her color scheme
on the original. It's more of a "classic" cop car color scheme. At first
glance, it just looks like they replaced Strongarm's blue with black, and
although that's largely true, there is a BIT more to the color scheme than
that. For one, the front bumper is now white-- which looks a lot better
against the black than silver, so props there. The stripe along the sides
is also a bit thicker, which helps keep Strongarm from getting too much
black in vehicle mode in particular. Since Strongarm is already mostly
black, the black windows on the original are now blue, a nice "color swap"
and one that looks pretty good against the black. (I do wish it was a few
shades lighter for more contrast, though.) In robot mode, Strongarm has
some more blue, on the center section of her body as well as on her head.
She's got her usual yellow headcrest, a white faceplate, and some tiny
aquamarine paint apps on her eyes. I do wish her upper legs were perhaps
white or blue for just a bit more color differentiation, but otherwise
everything's broken up pretty well in that mode, too.

     No mold changes have
been made to legion Patrol Strongarm.

     The legion class version
of Patrol Strongarm is definitely the one to get-- and honestly your only
good choice if you want a Strongarm toy not in your traditional Strongarm
colors. The more common police car colors on her look fairly nice overall,
and combined with the white I think look slightly better than her normal
color scheme.
