    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Darkmount.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Darkmount

     The "Bard of Darkmount"--
i.e. Shattered Glass Straxus-- has a color scheme that, at first, appears
random, or perhaps a "polar opposite" of his regular color scheme. However,
it's actually based off a mis-colored version of the character from a UK
comic back in 1990. Talk about obscure! Anyways, the most prominent color
for the Bard here is rather odd-- it's meant to be gold plastic, but it's
actually much more of a mustard yellow with glittery flakey bits in it.
By itself it doesn't look bad, but the gold paint right next to it (such
as on the bottom of Straxus' feet, which are in plain view in vehicle mode)
makes it look really off. That said, the light green plastic complements
the mustard yellow and black exceedingly well, and makes the Bard's color
scheme a bit more "cheery", as befits a Shattered Glass Decepticon. There's
also a few nice red and silver paint apps to help round things out, though
these definitely accent colors, no more.

     No mold changes have
been made to the Bard of Darkmount. Of note is that in addition to being
a Botcon 2012 exclusive, the Bard of Darkmount was only available ("free")
if you bought the expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked the
set up in person at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt worth quite
a lot of money, even for a Botcon exclusive.

     The "Bard of Darkmount"
seems a bit random-- after all, I don't think anyone was particularly begging
for this recolor to be made-- but most of the color scheme works well.
The mustard yellow really should've been a gold shade, however-- it that
had been the case, I think this whole scheme would've looked much better
and the bottom of his feet wouldn't have clashed with the rest of the turret
in tank mode. It's definitely my least favorite of the color schemes this
mold has had.

       The Bard of Darkmount is the most renowned
poet and playwright of Cybertron. His masterpiece, "Xal Unbound" is regarded
as the turning point of philosophy and theater for Cybertronian kind. When
the war came, he withdrew to his home beyond Darkmount. He did not interfere
with the war and the war, bizarrely, returned the favor. It was only when
the wall between worlds was breached that he stirred from his sanctuary.
His involvement in recent events is a baffling curiosity to most and a
dire warning to the wise.

       The poet's sonic cannon shatters steel
and his pick can lay even the most terrifying Dinobot low, but his voice
is his true power. His songs and poems dispel his allies' fears and crush
his foes' morale. He is full of joy and wit, to the point that rumors circulate
that he has supernatural insight that sets him beyond worldly concerns.
