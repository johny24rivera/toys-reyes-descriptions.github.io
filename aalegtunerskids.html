    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Autobot Skids. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RotF Legends class Autobot Skids

     Although this Skids redeco
has the same "Tuner" adjective as the
     <a href="aaskids.html">
      deluxe version
     </a>
     ,
it doesn't follow the same color scheme patterns. Sure, like the deluxe
Tuner Skids, this version is still mostly green to help with recognition
and keep the character on shelves while still keeping him "new"; but it
takes a different approach to make it "unique". There's still a bit of
black on the figure, but it's relegated to a more secondary color on this
version, with more parts being a light milky green (a bit softer of a color
than on the initial release of this mold, but otherwise pretty much the
same shade). The windows are also still the metallic silvery blue, though
it's a bit darker on this version to increase contrast. The most interesting
new addition is a nice silvery white pattern on the rear half of the vehicle,
with an angled silver Autobot symbol on the middle sides of said mode.
It looks helps make this version a bit more unique, and again, contrasts
well with the green. In robot mode Skids has a bit of bright yellow paint
on his legs, which of course is a natural contrast color against the green,
while still fitting in with the overall color scheme and keeping him fairly
light-colored overall. Otherwise most of the paint apps and color layout
are the same as on the original version of this mold.

     The Legends class version
of Tuner Skids-- as oppposed to the deluxe version-- goes for a lighter
version of Skids' general color scheme, and generally I think it looks
a tad better than the original scheme overall. I particularly like the
addition of silvery white on the back half of the vehicle mode, thoguh
a bit more paint in robot mode to break up all the green would've been
appreciated. Recommended over the original release of this mold, but not
any of the other repaints.
