    Megatron's futuristic
jet is just downright awful. I hate just coming right out and saying that
about a character that I think was so cool in the movie, but it's unfortunately
true. The wings are ludicruously small, the legs stick out from the back
very obviously, the arms are obviously Megatron's side "nosecones", his
main nosecone is stupidly short and looks downright silly, his push missile
launchers on his arms can't be fired in this mode, and his hands look really
weird in light red, which doesn't mesh with the overall color scheme at
all. I mean, I know some sacrifices have to be made to make Megatron into
a simpler design for the audience the Fast Action Battlers are aimed at,
but this just looks lazy. There are a few pluses, however relatively minor
they are-- for one, the mold detailing is excellent, and the paint detailing
is fairly good too. There's also a retractable landing gear in this mode
and his robot head is completely hidden-- this is the only Movie Megatron
mold to have either of those features in vehicle mode.

    Megatron's robot mode
is much, MUCH better. His proportions are very nice, and his head is molded
and painted very nicely-- he definitely looks like an evil leader, that's
for sure. The way only one side of his arms is painted with a "metallic
water blue" fade looks a little weird, however. Megatron's (tiny) vehicle
mode wings just kind of hang off his back, but they're folded away pretty
nicely and don't hamper articulation, so I don't really mind them. Speaking
of his articulation, it's fair, though not really good-- he can move at
the neck, shoulders (at two points), wrists, hips, knees, and waist (though
the latter is on that weird "can only turn me to the left and then I snap
back to the front position" swivel that nearly all the FABs have). He doesn't
have any elbow articulation, unfortunately, because of the push missile
launchers in his arms (which can actually be FIRED in this mode).

    Fusion Blast Megatron's
vehicle mode is really, really bad, but he does has a pretty good robot
mode-- however, pretty much all of the transforming Movie Megatron toys
have great robot modes as well. So unless you're a completist or you know
someone pretty young who REALLY wants a transforming Movie Megatron toy,
I'd recommend passing over this one.
