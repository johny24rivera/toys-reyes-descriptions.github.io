    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Gravity Bot
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Gravity Bot Optimus Prime

     Like many of the late
RotF line Optimus Prime repaints, the Gravity Bot redeco's chief difference
from Optimus Prime's traditional colors is replacing the front red section
with a silvery-gray color, and the changing of the colors of the flame
deco apps. I have to say, although it makes Prime a bit less colorful,
the shade of gray plastic they used for Optimus Prime's front half of his
vehicle mode is pretty good looking. Normally gray plastic on TFs looks
pretty dull, but this is a shade dark enough and "swirly" enough, with
enough metallic flakes in it, where it actually looks rather metallic.
It fades right into the silver flame deco pattern coming off of it perfectly.
The light red flames on the front end of the vehicle mode are a tad light
for my taste, but they still contrast with the gray fairly well and give
Optimus a "warm" color given that the red plastic is now gone from his
mold. Other than these changes to the front half of the vehicle mode, Battle
Steel Optimus Prime is pretty much the same as the original Gravity Bot
when it comes to colors and paint apps.

     Battle Steel Optimus
Prime is about on par with the original Gravity Bot in terms of color scheme.
Although the replacement of most of his red with gray makes him less colorful,
it's a really nice, attractive shade of gunmetal gray and goes well with
the other colors. The flame deco on the front still provides him with a
bit of red, anyways.

       Working with their human allies, the
Autobots created experimental new armor, which Optimus Prime plans to test
in the field. With his invincible new armor, the Autobot leader is looking
for the largest number of Decepticons he can, to put the new tech to the
test.
