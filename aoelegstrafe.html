    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Windrazor toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     This store-exclusive
release of Strafe at discount stores like Family Dollar and Dollar General
keeps the dark blue of the mass-release toys of the character, but instead
of using black as a major secondary color, a moderately light, milky and
dull blue is used as the other color for most of the main body. This leads
to a nice effect where the two main colors both contrast and complement
each other fairly well. The most noteworthy thing about Strafe's color
scheme, however, is the rather eye-catching greenish blue spray paint apps
on his wings. They "fade into" the dark blue quite well, and again, both
contrast and complement against the dark blue. However, when seen as a
whole, the whole toy doesn't really have enough shades OUTSIDE of blue
to make the color scheme particularly awesome-- it's just blue, blue, and
more blue, even if there's multiple shades of it. If it wasn't for the
blue-green spray, it would be outright boring. There's a bit of silver
paint on the beak and headcrest in beast mode and the face in robot mode,
but that's not nearly enough to make a substantial difference on the toy.
(The light blue eyes in both modes do look nice, as well, but again-- just
another shade of blue.)

     AoE legion Strafe is
a nice "consolation prize" for those who can't afford the more expensive
(and more accurate) Strafe toys, and it's a pretty decent mold, but I wish
there had been a bit of black or more silver paint added to break up the
color scheme of the main body more. The greenish blue spray on the wings
is nice, but the toy needed a bit more to make it stand out.

      *This toy's packaging does not actually have the "Age of Extinction"
label anywhere on it-- simply the "Transformers" logo-- but given that
it was released at the same time as the AoE line and the colors and name
are clearly inspired by AoE Strafe, I've included it in the line for simplicity's
sake.
