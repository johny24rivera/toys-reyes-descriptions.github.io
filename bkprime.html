    Prime's vehicle mode
is... alright, but it's pretty darn obvious where his head and robot arms
are hidden. Granted, it's pretty darn obvious where his head is hidden
on the mainline toy, but that's besides the point. It's a real shame that
his windows are the only thing that's painted on him, as he really could
use something to break up all the red. The mold detailing is pretty good
for a Kids' Meal toy, though, and although the proportions are a big kiddy,
they aren't too bad. I just hate how obvious his transformation is.

    Prime's robot mode has
pretty good proportions for a Kids' Meal toy, but it really looks more
like
    <a href="g1prime.html">
     G1 Prime
    </a>
    than
    <a href="cyprime.html">
     Cybertron
Prime
    </a>
    , given that the front of the vehicle becomes the chest and not
the shoulders. He really can't move in this mode much at all, though, and
it bares repeating that he really, REALLY could use some more paint detailing.

    Burger King Prime is
probably the best of the BK Cybertron toys, but that's really, really not
saying much. Only get it if you are a severe Prime completist or are too
poor to purchase any real Transformers.
