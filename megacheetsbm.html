    Beast mode is a cheetah.
This mode is one of the best Beast Machines beast modes I've seen, with
practically no extras. Although his cheetah head doesn't resemble the show
version at all, that's okay; I actually think it looks cooler like this.
The transparent red and transmetal gold blend in very well, and give Cheetor
a nice menacing look without making him look feral, like his
    <a href="cheetortm2.html">

    version did. Also, when you move his head from side to side, his
mouth moves by itself! There are 2 points of articulation in his tail,
a first in any of Cheetor's various forms. Also, you can bend Cheetor's
beast mode body in the middle, which is rare for a transformer. There are,
however, a few flaws with this mode. One is that the tail is made of the
cheap, bendy plastic, which makes it look less menacing, and it falls out
of its hole easily. Another is that the thumbs on his front feet and his
flipped-up heels on his back feet look rather odd; Hasbro could have easily
made a few alterations to conceal these. The last downside to this mode,
as well as the robot mode, is that the detailing on this figure is only
so-so when compared with other Beast Machines figures. The spark orb is
visible on Cheetor's right shoulder in this mode, although it switches
to the left shoulder in robot mode.

    There have been several
comments that I have heard on the transformation of Cheetor, and I want
to address these first before I move on to the robot mode description.
There have been rumors going around that Cheetor's transformation is ridiculously
simple; basically, you just do a short head-flip, stand him up, and fiddle
with his hands and feet a little. This, however, is not true. The "head-flip"
is quite complex- it takes several tries to get used to it- and it involves
tinkering with the stomach and chest plates as well. One downside to the
transformation process, however, is that Cheetor's beast head and neck
tend to snap off easily, and it takes quite a bit of effort to get them
back on again.

    Robot mode is very impressive,
and stands almost as tall as
    <a href="opop.html">

    </a>
    in
beast mode! This mode looks much more like the show version than the toy's
beast mode does, although there still is more green than the show version.
Again, however, the part of the body that looks least like the show's is
the most important part, the face. Although it looks a little similar,
there are some differences, such as the use of transparent red plastic,
chrome gold, and black on the face. Most of the positive comments on this
mode are the same as Cheetor's beast mode, such as the moving mouth and
slim look. There a bit more downsides to this mode than there were for
the beast mode, however. One, and the most obvious, is that it is very
hard to make the toy stand up by itself in this mode, as you could probably
guess by Cheetor's "chicken-walker" legs. The extension of Cheetor's lower
legs in this mode helps the problem some, but not much. Another is that
Cheetor's "sword" is little more than his sharp-tipped tail, and looks
pretty wimpy when compared with his swords on the TV show. The "sword-swinging"
action described on the box is pretty weak as well. You push his extension
on his right shoulder in and out to make his arm swing back and forth.
It looks more like he's waving his arm, saying, "Yuck, what smells!?" than
swinging his sword. Because of this action feature, the shoulder extension
always stays to the far right of his shoulder, and makes Cheetor look a
little lop-sided when compared with his other shoulder extension- it would
have been better if they would have made the left shoudler extension look
like this as well to even the balance some. Last but not least, Cheetor's
upper body tends to wobble a bit in this mode, as you push his moveable
mid-section from his beast mode up into his lower chest area. This tends
to get a little annoying after a while.

    An okay mega Maximal;
nice beast mode, but watch out for his inability to balance himself in
robot mode.

      Formerly hot-headed and inexperienced,
Cheetor is growing up fast on Cybertron; still remains Optimus Primal's
strongest supporter in the Techno-Organic war against Megatron and his
Vehicons. His beast mode offers cheetah-like speed, agility and endurance.
Sharp, powerful claws and jaws. Robot mode has enhanced, frictionless body
surface that causes energy pulses to glide right off. Cheetor can accelerate
particles around his aerodynamic form to create a vacuum useful in knocking
down opponents.
