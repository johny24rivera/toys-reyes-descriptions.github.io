    Optimus Prime's slightly-futuristic
truck vehicle mode is replicated pretty darned well at the Legion-class
scale. The cab looks solid proportionally, and the GENERAL look and outline
of the back two-thirds or so also looks pretty good, with the design's
characteristic angular points near the back. The mold detailing is quite
good near the front of this mode, with intricately-detailed smokestacks,
front sides (molded to look like there's small gaps there that ARE actually
there on many of the larger toys of this design), and the usual RID2015
"divots" here and there, though the back two-thirds has pretty minimal
mold detailing, and what is there is for the robot parts, like the fairly
obvious robot hands on the insides near the top of the back and the very
obvious robot feet that make up said back end. (There's some vents on the
bottom of the feet, but this toy doesn't have a traditional back end in
terms of having taillights, a rear bumper, etc.) There's also fairly obvious
upper legs on the lower middle sides of this mode. All of this said-- most
of these issues are also on the other RID2015 Optimus Prime toys, and often
to more obvious extents, so with that in mind this isn't as big of a deal
as it would be if these parts were well-hidden on the other toys. The color
scheme is typical Optimus, with red, blue, and black being the main colors,
though the red is just a touch lighter than other RID2015 Prime toys. There's
just a bit of silver paint in this mode, on the smokestacks and upper legs,
along with some black paint on the top of the robot feet and the front
truck window. It's a pretty well-varied color scheme, though because of
the mold breakup, there's a blue line down the center of the cab grill
and front hood, which looks a bit odd.

    To transform Optimus,
you basically just break up and fold back the legs that form the bottom
half and the arms that form the top half of the "trailer" section of the
truck, with the cab becoming a backpack, with a little headpiece rotating
up to peg securely above the chest. This is a more solid mode than the
vehicle mode, with the only real extras being the aforementioned cab backpack--
which stays out of the way of articulation for the most part and stays
behind the main body pretty well-- and the portions of the truck sides
that are molded onto the back of the lower arms, which are pretty minor
issues, considering the small scale. The proportions are pretty darned-near
perfect, with the only issue being the head is a bit small (the sculpting
is good, though the eyes have no paint), as well as the upper legs being
too short. Black is a bit more prevalent in this mode, being on the stomach
and waist as well as on the usual wheels and feet. A bit more silver paint
is visible on the middle arms, face, and the sides of the chest, and there's
blue paint on the lower arms, so no issues about one large area being just
one color here. For articulation Optimus can move at the shoulders (at
two points) and hips-- roughly average for a Legion toy, though the lack
of knee articulation is a bit disappointing, given there's no transformational
reason for him not to have articulation there. Both of Optimus' hands are
molded to hold Cyberverse-scale weapons, though sadly he doesn't come with
any.

    Legion RID2015 Optimus
Prime's vehicle mode does have a few obvious robot extras-- the hands and
feet most obviously-- but then again, that's the case with nearly every
mold of this design, and otherwise his proportions and color breakup in
both modes is pretty solid, especially for the small size. Recommended
if you're looking for a teeny version of this design.
