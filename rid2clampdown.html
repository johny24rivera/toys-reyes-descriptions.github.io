    Clampdown's alternate
mode is a little compact car. Granted, of course he's LITTLE, he's a Legion
class figure-- but it's still meant to be one of those little cars. His
proportions are pretty good, and he has no robot mode extras. As far as
kibble, there technically isn't any, but on the back end there is no central
section, which is a minor eyesore; however, it's a thin enough sliver where
unless you're looking at Clampdown from a rear view, it's not noticeable.
He's got an interesting color scheme-- he's mostly a dull orangish red
(for some reason it looks more red in the pics than in real life), with
a fair amount of black and purple. Of course, the dull orangish red is
due to his unique crabby robot mode, but the purple on the front bumper
and on the spoiler contrasts extremely well against the red. The windows
are painted black, and there's also black plastic on the wheels and on
the front side sections. Unfortunately, these front side sections stick
out like a sore thumb-- they're not orangish red like the surrounding pieces,
and they don't have the paint that's on the surrounding pieces either.
It looks kinda bad. Fortunately, that's about it as far as color oddities
go. The front bumper is painted silver, and given the teeth-like details
there, it's a "hint of what's to come". Well, more than a hint-- that literally
IS Clampdown's mouth in robot mode. The two parts of the mouth are supposed
to set seemlessly together in this mode, but they still stay apart a bit,
which is a minor issue (on a toy this small, it doesn't stick out much).
There's also white angular headlight paint apps that look really sweet,
and in a rather unique twist, there's some tan "wood paneling" paint apps
on the sides of this mode. A nice bit of a retro throwback, there, and
not something used often (ever?) on other car Transformers. There's a few
bits of mold detailing, like the vent on the hood and unpainted taillights
on the back end, but otherwise he's fairly sparsely detailed in this respect,
as is the case with most RID2015 toys.

    For Clampdown's robot
mode, the sides form his arms, the little legs fold out from the bottom,
and then the hood collapses to form the back of the robot mode while eyestalks
rotate up from behind the front bumper, and voila! It's a crab-man robot
mode! (Be careful with the eyestalks though, they are unfortunately a bit
fragile and can crack a little where you rotate them out.) This idea is
pretty darned awesome, and I love that it got a toy-- yes, even a Legion
toy, though of course a larger toy would've been even better. There's little
door-wings behind his body/head, but they enhance his silhouette a bit
and help remind you he IS a car, after all. Other than that, there's no
real extras beyond the back of the car sticking out juuuust a bit behind
his back. This back section also extends down behind his legs, which is
a minor bit of kibble, but it's actually beneficial-- Clampdown's legs
are TINY little crab legs that come to a point. This is, of course, accurate
to the show, but it means he can't stand on them, so that bit of kibble
behind his legs actually helps keep Clampdown more stable. He's got large,
long arms, which end in claws-- well, claws molded onto the pieces that
become the rear sides of the car, anyways. This is my biggest beef with
Clampdown-- he's a CRAB, you seriously couldn't give him clackin' claws?!
Bah. Still, he looks pretty good overall, and the wheels on the shoulders
are a nice look. Of course, the front of the car mode becomes the oversized
face/main body, and largely looks the same here, though of course the grill/jaw
makes more sense in this mode. I love the eyestalks, though the white paint
on them and the molding makes it look like Clampdown's eyes are narrowed--
which is kinda odd if you've seen the show, since he's a total comic relief
character. He's not exactly intimidating, he's cowardly. Regardless, it
looks awesome and I love that whole incredibly unique look. Color-wise
the black is more apparent in this mode on the legs and arms, but largely
it's the same in this mode, minus the tan wood paint apps (which aren't
readily visible)-- the only new paint apps in this mode are on the aforementioned
eyestalks. As far as articulation, Clampdown can move at the shoulders,
rotate at the wrists, and move at the hips, up-and-down slightly at the
mouth, and side-to-side a bit for each eyestalk. Thus, aside from my beef
with his claws being merely molded into larger pieces of plastic, he's
pretty articulated for a Legion class figure.

    Clampdown is a great,
incredibly unique Legion class figure-- he's got a very solid car mode
with unique aspects to it like the wooden panels and the front bumper,
and a VERY cool crab-bot robot mode with tiny legs, a huge face w/ articulated
eyestalks, and large claw-arms. It's a real shame his claws are merely
molded in and can't articulate, but that's his only substantial downside.
An easy recommendation, even if you don't normally get Legion figures.
