    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read
the review of the original Prime "Robots in Disguise" commander Megatron

     This redeco of Megatron
is meant to imitate his appearance in the
     <i>
      Predacons Rising
     </i>
     movie
that ended the
     <i>
      Prime
     </i>
     TV series, in which he was basically possessed
by Unicron and took on more of Unicron's more "rocky-earthy" elements,
and well as becoming ridiculously powerful. Thus, much of Megatron this
time around is now brown instead of gray, but thankfully, it's not just
a blah brown-- it's a rather swirly, bronze-ish shade of the plastic, which
looks quite good. (Not as good as bronze paint would've looked, but still
good.) Black is his other main color, which is basically just a neutral
color for the others to bounce off of. The yellow, gunmetal gray, and silver
paint apps-- particularly the yellow stripes on the chest-- are what help
this redeco stand out a bit more, and it all adds some really nice contrast
to what is otherwise a fairly dark color scheme. The purple transparent
plastic from the original version of this mold is kept the same for Unicron
Megatron. It generally doesn't "fit" with the color scheme overall-- it
just doesn't look quite right against the bronze-brown-- but the whole
reason for Unicron Megatron's existence is kind of due to Dark Energon,
so having some part of him being that Dark Energon-y shade of purple makes
sense. (Megatron's eyes are also purple instead of their usual red, indicating
Unicron's control.)

     Unicron Megatron has
no mold changes, and that to me is the biggest issue with this toy. His
appearance in the show was certainly based around his original Prime design,
but there were fairly substantial differences, particularly in how "rocky"
he looked, his vehicle cockpit, and his head design. Making this just a
recolor of Megatron is rather disappointing, budget restrictions or no.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Unicron Megatron has
a fairly good color scheme (and certainly one that is unique for Megatron),
having darker, more earthy tones in general and some nice paint apps, the
yellow in particular. However, the lack of any remolding and this mold's
absolutely awful vehicle mode make this a recolor not worth getting unless
you desperately want a "normal" toy of his Unicron upgrade and not a
     <a href="bhconstructbots.html">
      Construct-Bot
     </a>
     .
This is especially true given that Unicron Megatron was not released in
the U.S., and thus is more difficult and expensive to get than most Beast
Hunters toys.
