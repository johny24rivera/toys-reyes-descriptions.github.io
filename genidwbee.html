    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is a vaguely Camaro-esque sportscar, but a bit longer and with two little
spoilers at the back end. Combined with the two black stripes going down
the top, this means that this form is clearly meant to hearken to his movieverse
version, while keeping it from being an out-and-out licensed car mode and
keeping things a bit more streamlined and G1-ish. It certainly fits the
"upgraded, semi-warrior Bumblebee" persona that he took in the IDW comics
around the time this form was introduced in early 2010. The mold detailing
for Bumblebee is quite sparse in this mode on the top end, though I understand
it because of the aim for a streamlined mode. (Plus, Bumblebee's always
had a curved, fairly smooth alt mode, anyways.) The paint detailing is
decent, but not exceptional-- a bit more on the main body of the car mode
besides the two stripes would've been appreciated, but the silver hubcaps,
light red taillights, gunmetal gray bumpers, silver headlights, and silvery
blue rear windows still break up his yellow juuust enough for this mode
to not look prototypish and overly lacking. I'm not fond of the rear windows
being painted blue while the side and front windows are plain clear plastic,
though-- such a discrepancy in opaque-ness as well as color just doesn't
work with me. Make all the windows clear or paint them, if you ask me.
(At least you can't see really obvious robot bits inside Bumblebee's windows,
though there isn't a detailed interior with seats in there, either.) As
for the color scheme, it's Bumblebee yellow, black, and gray, you either
like it by now or you don't-- this toy won't change your mind here. (I'm
not a fan of yellow, and he's got a rather plain shade of the color for
his plastic, though it does its job, I suppose.) What really bothers me
about this mold, though, has nothing to do with the mold layout, but with
the VERY obvious color difference between Bumblebee's yellow plastic and
his yellow paint. His yellow paint seems to have a bit too much "water"
or something in it, as the plastic color it's painted over "bleeds through"
slightly, like the paint could've used another coat or two. It's also definitely
paler than the yellow plastic-- this is particularly obvious on Bumblebee's
guns in this mode. It just looks awful. Speaking of Bumblebee's guns, they're
stored on the rear side portions of this mode. You can combine both weapons
to form a larger, more solid weapon, which I think looks great-- but only
in that configuration. With the weapon separated into two different pieces,
the fact that they're halves of a larger weapon is entirely too obvious
and particularly looks odd given the rather two-dimensional bit of "blue
plasma fire" that's molded into the front of the weapons. On another side
note, Bumblebee's doors CAN open by themselves in this mode, but you have
to un-tab them from the lower arms inside. Thus, opening up the doors all
the way not only exposes the arms and interior obviously, but tends to
unhook the rear portion of this mode because of the force needed to remove
the car doors from the tabs, so opening the doors, though possible, is
not recommended.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
again takes many of its design cues from his movieverse version, what with
the car door "shoulder wings", the hood-chest (though the hood on this
Bumblebee's chest is fake), having the car roof fold up behind his back,
and the way his legs are formed from the back half of the car mode. However,
his headsculpt is quite nice and very much an updated G1 face (with the
face slightly smaller in proportion to the "helmet" and horns to give Bumblebee
a slightly "stronger, older" look). His eyes' light piping also works extremely
well. The detailing is simpler and on the G1 side, with simple feet that
have fake head/taillights for toes. The addition of gray-- even if it's
a bland, mildly light gray-- and more black helps to break up this mold's
colors a lot more in this mode, and nearly all of the car mode paint apps
show up here as well, so Bumblebee's definitely adequately painted, here.
However, that pale bland yellow paint is also used on the outside of his
lower arms, and looks even more awful there compared to its presence on
his gun, given the darker background color of the plastic. For proportions,
Bumblebee generally has curvy, simple proportions, with a bit more of a
wide-shouldered stance that he's come to be known for in more recent years.
He does have a bit of kibble, however. First, the roof on his back, though
this mostly stays out of the way and is only a minor eyesore. The door
wings could've stood to be a bit shorter, but they complement the silohuette,
so I have no issues with those. The back fender also forms his kneecaps
quite ingeniously, though they-- and one of the knees, on mine-- are a
bit annoyingly floppy, so a heads up, there (though he can still stand
up by himself easily, thanks to his large feet). For articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
waist, hips (at two points), knees, and ankles (at two points). I wish
he has slightly more movement at the knees, and his roof backpack can get
in the way of waist rotation a bit, but otherwise he's quite poseable.
Finally, one important note about the transformation-- his lower legs shift
from one side of a slider to another when transforming him. This slider
often takes a fair amount of force to push from one side of the back of
the leg to the other, and is easy to overlook-- however, if you DO overlook
it, you'll be stuck for quite a while trying to figure out why his vehicle
mode doesn't all fit together at the rear end (as I certainly did). It
does put a bit of undue strain on the knees, which worries me a bit. But
don't forget about it!

    Generations "IDW" Bumblebee
is for fans of the "era" of IDW TF comics that this design came from, and
for those who like the movie Bumblebee
    <i>
     design
    </i>
    , but not the movie
    <i>
     aesthetic
    </i>
    .
Otherwise, the floppy knees, fairly bland yellow color, over-use of the
character, and severe mis-matching of his yellow paint make this my least
recommended release of this otherwise decent mold.
