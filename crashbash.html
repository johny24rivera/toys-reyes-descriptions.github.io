    "Crashbash" is the new
trademark-friendly name for Squeezeplay, one of the smaller headmasters
from G1. Squeezeplay in G1 was some two-legged crab monster, so they sorta
changed his form for this Titan Master version, but at least he's still
a beast. But I get ahead of myself. As far as the actual Titan Master toy,
he has the usual Titan Master proportions and articulation-- he can move
back-and-forth at the hips and knees (both legs as one), along with ball
joints at the head (neck if he's in head mode) and at the shoulders. The
gray in the middle helps break up the violet plastic that's otherwise prominent
on the little guy. The mold detailing is quite interesting-- Crashbash
definitely has a lot of angular crevices on his main body and in head mode,
which is a more detailed version of the G1 Squeezeplay head with a more
evil-looking expression. Rather sinister, actually-- I love it. As for
paint, he's got a bit of silver on his Titan Master head (which looks like
a mini version of the head mode), and some silver paint on the head mode
with some red eyes.

    Crashbash's Titan Master
combines with his accessory to form a t-rex mode, which is my favorite
of all of his modes. I love how the Titan Master is connecting inside the
chest, with the Titan Master little arms forming the t-rex arms-- I LOVE
that kind of integral play. The lower legs also form the lower jaw of the
t-rex, another great addition. There is a rather obvious handle on the
top of this mode, and the tail is very obviously another beast head, but
these are relatively minor things overall. The mold detailing is somewhat
basic robotic detailing, but it works-- it's just that nothing in particular
stands out to me beyond the angular ridged details on the legs. The color
scheme has a nice hue of violet, but as for the light milky brownish gray--
though it contrasts against the violet alright, the hue is just ugly. It's
got some glitter in it which ups my opinion of it a bit, but light brown
or light metallic would've worked better. The light green for the eyes
is a GREAT color against the violet that I wish was used a bit more, and
the silver on the tail contrasts well with the violet as well. In this
mode, Crashbash can move at the arms, at two points at the mouth, and back-and-forth
at the hips and base of the tail.

    Crashbash's other beast
mode is... weird. It's like a combination of an ostrich and a pterodactyl.
The chest shells of the t-rex mode become "wings" that are oddly shaped,
while the tail of the t-rex mode becomes the head and the t-rex head and
back section in turn become the "tail" which the Titan Master plugs into
to stand on. The legs stay the legs. I guess they wanted to give Crashbash
some sort of flight mode, but this... thing... really doesn't seem like
it could fly. Beyond being a platform on which the Titan Master can stand
on, the t-rex head and back also forms a pretty bad tail. As for articulation,
in this mode he can move up-and-down at the neck, back-and-forth at the
hips, and at the base of the wings on ball joints. The "tail" section can
also move up-and-down at two points.

    Crashbash's weapon mode
is an afterthought, pure and simple. It's his t-rex mode with the Titan
Master taken out, the legs rotated down and pegged into the sides, the
tail flipped in to show a rectangular hole, and the handle flipped out.
It's literally just a t-rex with his feet pointed forward and tail tucked
in, and even with the blaster-like details in the feet and neck base, it's
difficult to see it as anything else. This mode is best forgotten.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Crashbash's t-rex mode
is pretty awesome, the Titan Master figure itself is pretty well-detailed
and unique, and the violet hue is pretty nice. On the other hand, the "pterodactyl"
and especially the weapon mode are lazy and/or weird, and the light brownish
gray is a bad shade of the color. Overall I'd consider him slightly below-average
as far as Titan Master sets go, but as far as the three different versions
of this mold go, I'd recommend this one the most since it's actually a
quasi-update of a character that hasn't gotten a new toy since the late
'80s.
