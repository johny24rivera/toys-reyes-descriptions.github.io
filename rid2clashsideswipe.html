    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 warrior
Sideswipe toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Warrior redecoes, actually LOOKS quite a lot like his end-of-Season-1 form
in BOTH modes. The main color has been changed from a dark red to a light
milky gray. Now, granted, I don't normally like light milky gray, and this
toy doesn't change that-- I definitely would've preferred a more metallic
shade of the color-- but it's broken up quite a bit by three other major
colors-- black, light blue, and dark red. The electric blue is quite prolific
on this Sideswipe redeco, which is a big part of the "Season 1 upgrade"
forms. He's got big sections of it down the center of his alt mode, on
the lower rims, as well as on the shoulders, painted around his face like
a "helmet", and on the knees, waist, hands, and chest. So basically just
about everywhere. The thing, though, is that the paint and the plastic
are noticeably different, with the plastic definitely a bit darker and
more "electric"-looking than the paint. That said, they don't directly
come against each other in many places beyond the front hood, so for the
most part it's not obvious. There's also some black, mostly in the same
places as on the original Sideswipe-- the sword, the wheels, the upper
legs and upper arms, and the windows (painted metallic black this time,
not left translucent). It helps give the scheme a bit of a dark color to
bounce off of, as the light milky gray and light blue are a bit too light
for a color scheme by themselves. What really helps make this color scheme,
though-- interestingly enough-- is the moderately dark red paint, i.e.
the dominant color on regular Sideswipe. It's used for stripes on the front
hood and on the sides of the vehicle mode, as well as some bits on the
head, waist, and lower legs. The red contrasts quite excellently against
the light blue and helps add some more color to the scheme while also,
of course, tying it into Sideswipe's traditional scheme. It works as a
nice accent without being so dominant it looks too much like the original
toy.

     No mold changes have
been made to "Clash" Sideswipe-- which is a bit of a shame, as on the show
he had new shoulder, chest, and head armor, among a few other details.

     Sideswipe is easily
my favorite of the 2015 Warrior "Clash" redecoes, as not only is it the
only one substantially different from the original, but it really makes
an effort to look as much like the show model as possible without budgeting
in any mold changes. Of course, I do wish the mold changes on the show
were present on the toy, but the paint apps help match many of those details
so well I don't really miss them nearly as much. It also just looks more
visually interesting than the original warrior Sideswipe toy.
