       Egads, what a lazy repaint.
All they did was take RiD Prime's much better-looking red and replace it
with a weird banana yellow. And... that's it. Everything else is the exact
same. The toy itself isn't bad- as you can see from the rating I gave it-
but the sheer laziness of this repaint is what angers me. Plus, the yellow
simply doesn't work as well for him as the red did, especially with that
red chest and sirens that he still has. HOWEVER.... Universe Optimus Prime
is danged cheap. Like you get a $30 for $17- that's almost 50% off! That's
a heck of a deal.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Optimus Prime is sure
a lazy repaint... but he is pretty cheap. However, even with this price
decrease, I'd still recommend the original RiD Prime over this guy, since
that yellow simply doesn't work as well with him. Mildly recommended if
you don't have RiD Prime and don't feel like searching for him; otherwise,
not recommended even for completists.

           An even lazier repaint
than Universe Prime, Universe Magnus again has only one color changed,
but this time it's a much less apparent color change. His dark blue has
been changed to a blusih-black, and it's only really apparent on his legs.
Big whoop. He is $13 cheaper than the other Ultra Magnus, though...

           I'd have to recommend
Universe Magnus over RiD Magnus for the sole reason that he's $13 cheaper,
and the bluish-black looks ever-so-slightly better on him than the dark
blue did. However, if you already have RiD Magnus, I can't recommend him
under any circumstances.

               Again, Omega Prime has
only had two color changes; the dark blue has been changed to bluish black
and the red to banana yellow (most of it, anyways; the parts from Ultra
Magnus are still red, and it sure clashes). Although the bluish black isn't
bad, the banana yellow completely clashes with every other color. It simply
should NOT be there. I don't know what the color designers were thinking
with this one...

              <font face="OCR A Extended">
               Omega Prime is a great
gestalt, but even for the combined price of $34 U.S. (as opposed to $60),
he just looks bad. I'd recommend the original one over this guy, and I
DEFINITELY wouldn't purchase either component if you already have the original
version.
