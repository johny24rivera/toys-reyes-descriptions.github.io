    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Obi-Wan Kenobi. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Obi-Wan Kenobi

     Egads, they really need
to put this mold to rest already-- this is the fourth time it's been used
in a little over a year, with a FIFTH coming down the pipe shortly. Especially
since only one major color is changed for the most part on these repaints.
Well, regardless, Mace Windu's colors go together pretty well. The purple
really offsets the dull gray very nicely, and makes the overall toy look
more attractive than any other iteration of this mold besides
     <a href="darthvader2.html">
      Darth
Vader
     </a>
     . He's got plenty of other paint apps, too, something that SWTFs
have never skimped out on-- the brown on the legs look nice, as does the
silver on the R2 unit and the cockpit, but the white is what really stands
out. All the previous iterations of this mold had rather dull-colored legs
and arms, but the white really adds something to the limbs.

     As with the other Jedi
Starfighter repaints, Mace Windu has a new head mold and miniature Mace
Windu figurine to fit inside the cockpit. The head mold is rather ugly,
though-- sorry, Samuel L. Jackson's face does not look very good as a mechanized
version of itself. They stayed a bit too true to Mace Windu's actual face
while still trying to "mech it up", and the results makes Mace Windu look
like an incredibly old man. Ick.

     Mace Windu has the second-best
color scheme out of the various Jedi Starfighter repaints, second only
to Darth Vader. The purple and white really add to the overall color scheme
of the figure-- the head remold is pretty bad, though.

       Mace Windu is a man of peace, but he
doesnÂ’t hesitate to fire up his starfighter when the galaxy spirals into
war. Flying his Jedi starfighter, Windu races to help his fellow Jedi who
are under attack in the Jedi Temple. When he arrives, he morphs his starfighter
