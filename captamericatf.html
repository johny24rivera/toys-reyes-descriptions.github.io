    Captain America's alternate
mode is a heavily-armored military Humvee. Design-wise, this mode is very
good. The proportions are more-or-less spot-on, with the only real exception
being the overly-large "spare tire" on the back end, which becomes the
Cap's shield in mech mode. Still, even though it's a bit oversized, making
the shield a tire IS pretty ingenious. There's no mech mode extras visible
in this mode whatsoever-- even the knees on the back end are covered up
by rear bumper panels. There's also a TON of mold detailing on Captain
America, to the point where it puts almost every other Marvel Transformer
to shame. bolts and rivets on the sides, paneling everywhere, vents, door
handles, headlights and tail-lights, criss-cross detailing on most of the
front half... it's all there. Unfortunately-- and this is my problem with
the alt mode-- almost none of it is painted. The front bumper is painted
up quite nicely with some red and silver, and the internal of the wheels,
"spare tire" and the front and side windows are painted, but that's it.
Captain America has HYUUUUGE areas of unpainted plastic on him that, combined
with the odd sudden transition halfway through his alt mode from dark blue
to red, makes the toy really look like an unfinished prototype. Honestly,
as of this writing the only Marvel TF who has it worse in this department
is

    Just like his vehicle
mode, Captain America's mech mode is more or less pretty good, except for
one big detail. Proportion-wise, for the most part he's quite good-- his
chest sculpt being made from the front bumper looks quite good, and his
legs are more or less good too, though the lower halves are a bit overly
large. Using wheels for the upper arms makes them look like biceps, which
is a neat design nod, and I love how the spare tire "expands" slightly
to become Cap's shield, which can plug onto the side of either arm. His
face sculpt is quite well-done, looking quite a lot like a robotic version
of Captain America, though his expression looks a little too mean, in my
opinion. His couple of vehicle mode extras-- his roof, parts of his side
doors, the sides of his front section-- either fold/clip out of the way
or accent the mold as shoulder armor. The Cap's articulation is also pretty
good-- he can move at the neck, at the base of each of his head-crests,
at the shoulders (at two points), the elbows (at two points), the wrists,
waist, hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and a bit at the ankles,
so every major point is covered on this dude. This, combined with his large
feet, means that you can get him into some pretty cool poses. Unfortunately,
Captain America's lack of paint continues in this mode-- his head is painted
up nicely, but that's it. All the other sparse paint detailing carries
over from vehicle mode. Which is a shame, given that he has some cool servo/piston
detailing, particularly in his upper legs. What really bugs me about Cap
in this mode, however, is that his shoulders are on a VERY flimsy sliding
mechanism. Simply put, it's very difficult to get them into a position
where they don't just flop around and can actually hold a pose, and when
you finally manage to do so you better not move him or it's back to being
floppy again. It's EXTREMELY annoying, and given the transformation there's
absolutely no reason for it, which makes it even MORE annoying. His arms
are also a bit skinny when looked at from a head-on angle, to boot.

    Captain America, when
it comes to his overall design, is quite an impressive toy in both modes
(but especially in vehicle mode). He's got great proportions and articulation,
and some fantastic mold detailing. But his almost prototypish lack of paint
detailing, odd color scheme in vehicle mode, and extremely annoying and
flimsy-looking arms really drag on him, as both of them are pretty big
problems. Mildly recommended if you like the Cap, but keep in mind the
aforementioned problems, as they ARE major.

      Sometimes world-class threats require
world-class power. That's when Captain America steps into his specially-built
mech suit. Fast, made of same indestructible Vibranium alloy as his shield,
and attuned to his perfect reflexes, only a Super Soldier like Captain
America could control the awesome power of this battle suit. Plus, the
vehicle mode is rugged and stealthy, giving him the drop on evildoers!

      *This toy was later re-released in the "Transformers Mech Machines"
subline of the Avengers movie toyline. However, beyond the different packaging
this later release was exactly the same as the intial release.
