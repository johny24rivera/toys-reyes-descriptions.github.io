    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Alpha Bravo.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Alpha Bravo

     Aaaand here we finally
have the character this mold was made for in the first place. Vortex sticks
to his G1 color scheme fairly closely, but with a few extra paint apps
due to the larger size. Vortex's helicopter mode is mostly a flat gray,
which isn't really a great main color, even if it is realistic. Luckily,
Vortex has a handful of other colors-- particularly in robot mode-- that
help to liven things up a bit. There is some black-- which admittedly does
NOT liven things up a bit-- but is used in places where it makes sense,
like the rotors and on the windows. The tint of dark greenish blue plastic
used for the base of his rotors, upper arms, hips and waist, head, and
a few other minor parts is a really nice shade of the color, both adding
some color while staying in the same "dark, dull" category as the gray
to complement it. The yellow color works well on the missiles, as well
as on the stripe on his chest-- a nice accent color to help lighten things
up some. The red on the abs and on the optic visor is also a nice shade,
too. Along with the greenish blue, though, the dark purple paint is what
REALLY helps to bring Vortex's color scheme together, with lines on the
sides of the copter mode and some on the robot chest and lower abdomen.
Particularly on the robot chest, this combination of colors looks great
and really makes Vortex look far and away from being just a "dull gray"
Transformer. I will say that I'm not crazy about the color of Vortex's
weapons, though-- they're both that really blah light milky gray that I
wish Hasbro would do away with altogether.

     Combiner Wars Vortex
is not only the character that the mold fits best-- having obviously been
originally made for him-- but as for the 2015 releases of this mold, this
one is definitely my favorite. Sure he's got a fair amount of dull gray,
but the way most of his other colors-- the greenish blue and purple in
particular-- contrast with the other colors, and the way the paint apps
are spread out, looks great.

       Decepticon Vortex is the interrogator
the Decepticons call when they need someone to cough up information. He'll
take his targets for a wild ride, twisting, turning, looping, and diving
through the sky. It's enough to make any bot cough up their secrets...
and then some.

        Most Cybertronians secretly prefer either
their robot mode or their alternate mode, but Vortex is completely comfortable
either way. As the interrogator for the Combaticons, Vortex has found effective
ways to glean information from prisoners in either mode. He's learned critical
secrets by magnetizing bots and taking them for the ride of their lives
in helicopter mode-- dangling them over certain doom to encourage compliance.
As a robot, the closer his rotor blades come to a prisoner, the more likely
it is that the captive will talk. Vortex utilizes a high-impact "glue gun"
to paralyze other aircraft and robots. With fellow Combaticons forms Bruticus.

         Vortex is one of the few Decepticons
you might actually describe as friendly. He's witty and encouraging-- almost
chatty. Other bots walk away from a conversation with Vortex feeling good...
until they realize they might have said too much. Interrogation has many
forms, and it's not always reserved for your enemies. Forms either an arm
or a leg of Bruticus, the combined form of the Combaticons.
