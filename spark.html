not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Inferno. For

     Called Spark officially
because his more commonly-known name, Pyro, has already been taken by a
certain Marvel character, he's based heavily on the Pyro/Spark toy that
came in that hazy European G1/G2 era that was sort of "between generations".
Still, he definitely had the typical loud G2 coloration back in his initial
release, and it certainly carries over to this update, with the color scheme
fairly slavish to the original. A bright red-to-the-point-of-being-almost-pink
fire truck with the back half being mostly yellow with black stripes. And
then in robot mode there's a buncha periwinkle, with a little bit of black
so he has at least ONE dark color in there. Yeah, he'll blend in nicely
in the real world... I actually think the periwinkle works with the black
and light red in some odd way-- even ignoring the "loud G2 kitsch" factor
that is part of the draw of a large portion of this year's set. It's also
impressive the sheer amount of paint applications on Spark-- ALL of his
yellow is painted on, as is most of his black, so that entire back half
of his vehicle mode is more or less covered in paint. He's also got some
great paint apps on his front end as well, with a great-looking bronze
bumper and some nice transparent lights. There's also some nice isolated
silver and green paint apps here and there that are just there to help
break up the colros a bit more and make him look even more varied in color.
One could argue he has too many colors, but again... G2, people. G2.

     No mold changes have
been made to Spark, but a little bit of mold degradation is apparent--
the joints, though not TOO bad, are noticeably looser than on Universe
2.0 Inferno.

     Botcon 2010 Spark is
another toy in the set that's pretty darn loud and rather hideous in all
honestly, but you can still tell a LOT of effort went into it to make it
that slavishly loud and hideous. Like many others in this years' set, if
you like the "so bad it's good" G2 kitsch kinda look, then I recommend
him. If not, stay away.

       Sir Pyro Ignatius Spark, "Pyro" to his
friends, is the first of the Earth-born Transformers to be recognized as
a citizen of a human nation, in his case the United Kingdom. Knighted in
2007 after his new Autobot team rescued the Queen from Clench's Decepticon
Syndicate, he doesn't have a cruel or cowardly bolt in his body. He often
masks his competence with eccentric behavior and irreverent observations
to put his foes off-guard and considers himself "human" in all the ways
that matter. When not leading the G2 Autobots, he moonlights for the London
Fire Brigade as a firefighter and an engine. Forestonite exposure gave
Pyro the ability to perceive events a few seconds into the future, granting
him preternaturally sharp reflexes. In addition, he can focus this power
on an object to read events in its recent past.
