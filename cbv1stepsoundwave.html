    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 1-step Soundwave
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RID2015 1-step
Soundwave toy

     Unlike the other RID2015
1-step redecoes for the first wave, I can understand why Hasbro re-used
the RID2015 Soundwave mold for Cyberverse-- it's basically the same design,
with some minor detail and proportional differences. Cyberverse Soundwave
also has a slightly more "cheery" color scheme than RID2015 Soundwave,
with a more medium shade of milky blue for his (by far) primary plastic
color. His wheels are also a more normal black compared to the red of the
RID2015 toy, while the shoulders and the head are still a dark-- though
still milky-- shade of blue. As far as paint, the paint apps on this version
are a bit more dyanmic, to at least make him look more "G1-y" than the
toy he's redecoed from. The most obvious difference between the RID2015
design and Cyberverse is the headsculpt, so in addition to him having a
red visor, his vents and most of what would be the lower portion of RID2015
Soundwave's "eye-face" have been painted gray to mimic Cyberverse Soundwave's
more traditional faceplate, and it actually largely works. There's still
certainly some oddities, such as the head "crown" being way too big, though.
The lower arms and upper legs are painted gray (at least on the front--
not on the sides, unfortunately), with some basic geometric red details
on the arms that again mimic Cyberverse Soundwave's details. The outline
of the "tape deck" chest-- and the faux chest on the front of the vehicle
mode-- are still painted yellow, but it's a more golden-y yellow paint
this time around. Since this isn't a RID2015 toy anymore, the allegiance
symbol sticker on the top of the vehicle mode is gone, replaced with a
more traditional Decepticon symbol on the robot chest. The front windows
in vehicle mode are painted the same dull red as they were on the original
version of this mold; otherwise, beyond that and the front, the vehicle
mode is pretty paint-free, unfortunately.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Soundwave.

     There's certainly some
differences between Cyberverse Soundwave's design and RID2015 Soundwave's
design, but this redeco for the 1-step Cyberverse line largely works pretty
well, minus the robot head. The paint apps are more interesting, and I
like the lighter blue plastic more than the darker blue on the original.
If you want a really easy-to-transform toy of the character for a kiddo...
I mean, here you go.
