    This time around Anakin's
alternate mode is the freighter Twilight, which has a pretty interesting
shape. It's very asymmetrical, having one large and one small wing on one
side, but no wings on the other! (Don't ask me how it's supposed to fly.)
The smaller wing can also fold straight downwards, but then it's awfully
awkward to pose on a flat surface, of course. Anyways, as with most SWTFs,
the Twilight mode is pretty darned accurate. There's some pretty obviously
"cracks" in the mode, especially on the top, but the number of mech mode
extras is minimal. There are a few, though-- for some reason the hand on
the left side doesn't QUITE fold up under the engine vent it's supposed
to, and it's fairly obvious something is up with the two turbine engines
(at least I assume they're engines) on the left side of the vehicle. (One
becomes R2-D2 and the other his upper right arm.) On a lesser note, the
rear, which is a cargo bay, looks fine when the ramp is folded up. Keep
it down however, and Anakin's mech mode legs and feet are exposed! As for
weaponry, Anakin has a spring-loaded missile launcher on the topside of
this mode, and the gun on his large wing can rotate around in place.

    Anakin's mech mode is
decent, and following the alternate mode, is rather asymmetrical. His right
arm is the weaker of the two, having some obvious alt mode parts hanging
off the lower part of it (including the "wing" of the Twilight, which just
detaches from the vehicle mode and re-attaches here-- a bit cheat-y, I
must say, and it falls off way too easily. His left arm is better, with
a strong shoulder made out of a decent chunk of the vehicle mode. Otherwise
he's pretty decently proportioned, with his legs and arms not being overly
skinny like on many SWTFs. I like that the vehicle mode splits apart at
his waist to form a bit of a "skirt", though the "hood" around his head
is considerably less convincing. Really, they shouldn't try to mimic cloth
in plastic form-- it just looks weird. Anakin also has a slice of his vehicle
mode hanging unapologetically out of his upper back-- and horizontally,
at that. It doesn't get in the way of articulation, but it does look bad.
Speaking of articulation, Anakin can move at the neck, shoulders (at three
points), elbows (at two points), wrists, waist, hips (at three points--
though restricted due to the skirt armor), knees (at two points), and ankles
(at two points). So he can get in a pretty decent number of poses. As for
his color scheme, brown shows up more obviously in this mode, and helps
to break up the blue and white and make him one of the more colorful SWTFs
(though that's admittedly not saying much). The one thing that does big
me color-wise about him is that he has FOUR different shades of brown in
robot mode, all of them slightly different from each other. In some case
like this, simplicity is usually best, and two shades really would've been
enough. Plus, the shade used for his headsculpt looks all milky and made
of "impure" plastic, which doesn't fit an otherwise decent headsculpt.
Anakin has three little accessories-- first, he has a handheld spring-loaded
missile launcher-- and the missile is his lightsaber, which he can also
hold in his other hand. I love it when they do little things like that,
and the blaster looks perfectly fine without the missile in it, so no worries
there. He also has another gun (which doesn't fire a missile), taken from
the tip of his small wing in alt mode). What's also cool is that Anakin
comes with a little R2-D2 accessory, made up of a small part of the vehicle
mode that detaches. It can move or anything, unfortunately, but it's still
a cool little touch.

    Twilight Anakin is above-average
as far as Star Wars Transformers go. He's got a few minor problems in vehicle
mode and some more significant problems in mech mode, nearly all of them
related to kibble. They're not nearly enough to ruin the figure, though,
and he's definitely one of the more unique and colorful SWTFs with some
cool accessories. Mildly recommended if you like really unusual alt mode
designs.

      Anakin has modified the freighter he
found on Teth into a powerful ship with special technology. Attacking droid
fighters find out the hard way: when they launch an attack, Anakin instantly
changes the Twilight into a massive mech that smashes the droids into smithereens!
