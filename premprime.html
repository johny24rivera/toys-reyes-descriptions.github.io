    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Leader
class Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original Movie Leader class Optimus Prime toy

     "Premium" Optimus Prime
hardly differs from the original Leader class Movie Prime at all in terms
of color scheme. Usually the Premium toys have more metallic color schemes,
but only about a third of Optimus Prime's light gray plastic is now coated
in a nice-looking silver, unfortunately. (The parts that ARE silver are
the small bits on top of his shuolders, the inside of his tires, his upper
legs, and his truck grille.) Now, I can understand why very small parts
like the hands aren't painted silver, but really, this is the mold's third
use-- Hasbro should have made enough money off of this mold to coat more
of the plastic in silver than it did, especially when you look at some
of the other Premium toys. The other colors and paint apps on Premium Optimus
are almost exactly the same as they were on the original toy.

     What's probably going
to attract most buyers to Premium Prime, though, is that he's the only
Premium toy to get a mold change. More specifically, his head has been
remolded to be even more movie-accurate, with longer, more curved side
antennae. It looks good, better than the previous one, in my opinion. However,
the downside to this is that because the antennae are longer, there's little
holes in the top of the truck mode for them to poke through-- it's small,
but it's still a bit of an eyesore, admittedly. Also, Optimus Prime's hand-gun
has been replaced with a hand-sword, now. It folds out onto his hand like
the original's gun, though Prime's hand has to be retracted into his lower
arm this time around. Press the button on the top of the blade, and it
extends about another inch, with a rusty tip (Ouch, that's gotta hurt)!
There's also some neat "Allspark language" symbols engraved on the blade,
as well. As a whole, the new weapon's pretty cool, though it tends to fall
off its peg a bit too easily. Premium Optimus Prime has also had his "final
step transformation" sound replaced with the classic G1 transformation
sound effect.

     Premium Optimus Prime
doesn't have nearly as much metallic paint as I'd like, and his paint apps
are otherwise almost the exact same as the original's, so I can't recommend
him if you already have the original Leader class toy. However, if you
don't, I'd recommend this slightly over the original-- the added bit of
metallic silver, where it is added, looks very nice, and the new head and
sword are pretty cool, as well.

       For millenia, Optimus Prime has hunted
Megatron and the AllSpark across the universe. Now, at last, his search
is at an end, and he is determined that his long war end as well. The Decepticons
must be destroyed once and for all, no matter the cost. He proves his newfound
determination in battle against the powerful Bonecrusher, hurling the massive
Decepticon from a freeway overpass and engaging him in brutal close combat
with his energy sword.
