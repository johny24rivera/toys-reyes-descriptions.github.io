    This toy of Optimus Prime
is based loosely on his Generation 2 "Laser" toy, which was a pretty large
toy-- this is, obviously, a considerably smaller version of it (and just
the cab, mind you). Still, size aside, this mode looks pretty good proportionally,
with no obvious robot mode parts whatsoever. The very backs of the heels
stick out the back end, but this is VERY minor and easily overlooked. The
overall color scheme keeps Prime's traditional color scheme of red/blue/gray
and adds in a bit more black than is usual. Most of the colors go together
well enough-- particularly the red with either the dark blue or black--
but the light milky gray is a really odd shade. It's actually a tad
    <i>
     pinkish
    </i>
    ,
which just does not go very well with his other colors. This is one of
the few instances where I feel a duller milky gray would've worked better.
The transparent orange windows and silver paint apps do help to distract
away from that unsightly color, at least (though the painted-orange side
windows clash quite badly with the transparent front windows). In a bit
of a "movie-ish" touch, Optimus Prime has a flame deco on the front of
his cab, which looks pretty snazzy overall-- that said, the sudden change
in color from black for the truck's nose to dark blue at the middle doesn't
look too great. The mold detailing on Prime looks pretty good in this mode,
with some pretty intricate details on the tires and sides of the toy in
particular-- which stands in great contrast to the top of the truck, which
is pretty undetailed and smooth (and fairly accurate to this kind of real-life
truck, of course). Because this Optimus is in the "Reveal the Shield" subline,
he has a rub allegiance symbol in the center of his roof-- rub it to reveal
that, obviously, he's an Autobot.

    Optimus Prime's transformation
is considerably more involved than it looks. In order to keep his window-chest
"real" in this mode instead of just fake molded window details, there's
several more steps to the transformation than on the original Generation
2 "Laser" toy, despite this version being a lot smaller. There's several
great touches, such as the way the tires slide into the legs partially
and panels cover up the holes left by them, but overall the transformation
can be a bit annoying, particularly when you're getting him back into vehicle
mode-- it's one of those "everything has to be just right" transformations.
The proportions for this mode are pretty good, being a bit more rounded
than the original Generation 2 "Laser" toy. The hands and upper arms are
a bit small, but otherwise he looks great. He's LARGELY kibble-free, but
there's two rather unsightly panels that hang off his lower arms, and can
get in the way of arm movement a little. The lighter shade of blue in this
mode really pops with the red and black a lot more, and I wish it was more
visible in vehicle mode. Unfortunately that ugly pinkish gray is also more
visible in this mode, too. The mold detailing is interesting, blending
in his G2 "Laser" toy details with a movie aesthetic, making things a bit
more detailed and fragmented. I think it works, though, and makes him look
more individualistic. (He also has a Matrix of Leadership molded onto the
the panels inside his chest, which is a pretty ingenious move, given that
those panels are folded outwards in vehicle mode and thus "invisible" then.)
Prime has a cool transparent sword that unfolds from the back of his vehicle
mode, and is a neat accessory-- but be warned, it is a bit of a tight fit
for Prime's hands. As far as articulation goes, this Prime has it in spades--
he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at four points), elbows,
wrists (at two points), and at the waist, hips (at two points), knees,
and ankles (at two points). So you can pull off a LOT of nice moves with
him. One last note about this version of Prime-- there's a tab on his right
shoulder that can hinder articulation, and will in fact break off if you
fold that shoulder back very far. But you know what? Don't worry about
it. Do it, break the tab off-- it doesn't interfere with the transformation
at all, and the vehicle mode still feels solid enough without it. That
way Prime can have full movement range on BOTH of his shoulders.

    The deluxe "Laser" version
of Autobot Alliance Optimus Prime is a pretty decent toy in its own right,
if a bit overly complex simply for the sake of being complex. Quite frankly,
when looked at "from the bigger picture", it's an update to a toy that
didn't need updating in the first place-- the original G2 "Laser" toy still
stands the test of time, has a simpler transformation, and looks a bit
better in both modes as well. Still, if you don't want to pay the prices
for the older version, this serves as a decent (if small) substitute. Shame
about that ugly pinkish gray, though...

      As leader of the Autobots, and their
foremost warrior, Optimus Prime has gone through many changes over the
years. He alters his weapons and body based on the needs of a mission,
or as a result of damage sustained in combat. He learns from every situation,
always coming back to duty tougher and more powerful than before.
