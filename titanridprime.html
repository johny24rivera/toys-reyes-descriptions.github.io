    In vehicle mode, Titanium
RiD Prime actually IMPROVES upon the original
    <a href="ridprime.html">
     RiD
Prime's
    </a>
    vehicle mode-- quite impressive, considering the original cost
twice as much and didn't have any diecast metal in it. There's no more
blatant robot extras sitting in the middle of this mode like on the original
toy-- with the exception of a small part of the middle, everything looks
very boxy and fits in with the shape of a fire truck very well. And even
then, the small part in the middle is just where the back of his round
robot chest meets up with the square front and back halves of the mode,
and it doesn't really detract much from the mode. What is my main complaint
with this mode is how the front half of the fire truck is actually on an
ever-so-slightly lower plane than the back half-- just enough to be noticeable.
I'm not sure why it's made that way, but it is, and it doesn't look good
at all. The hinges also muddle a bit with the shape of the front part of
this mode, though that's a relatively minor drawback and a necessity considering
the transformation. Of course, at this scale Optimus doesn't have the same
pack of missile launchers on his fire ladder, but he still does have the
flip-out cannons on the front of the ladder for some vehicle mode firepower.
(The fire ladder can rotate and move up and down, just like on the original
toy, though it can't extend.) The mold detailing is very nice all-around,
and he has a fair amount of a paint detailing as well, though more of it
is visible in the robot mode. I think it's inexcusable that the sirens
weren't painted, however-- now they just blend into the same red as almost
everything else on the front part of the vehicle. The colors look just
as good on this toy as they did on the original, though it is odd that
a portion of the back end of the vehicle is dark red as opposed to the
moderately light red used for the rest. It's not too jarring of a transition,
but it is noticeable.

    Titanium RiD Prime doesn't
have a "normal" robot mode, and instead transforms directly into the super
robot mode. It looks fantastic-- in many aspects, it's better than the
original super mode, due to the fact that he doesn't have parts popping
off all the time. His proportions are great, with the sole exception of
the forearms being a little larger than they should be. His chest has been
"beefed up" a bit, so that the chest is wider than the stomach, instead
of it all just being pretty square in its proportions-- it looks nice,
especially with the Autobot sash across it. All his paint apps REALLY come
out in the open in this mode, making it look even better than it otherwise
would have. His ladder-weapon hangs behind his back, just like on the original,
though also like the original, it can swing forward over his shoulder to
become a massive cannon. He also has pop-out arm cannons, though they're
admittedly pretty puny and don't add much to the figure. To accomplish
RiD Prime's transformation in a more simplistic manner, the front half
of the vehicle mode actually turns itself inside out to become the lower
legs-- a very interesting and ambitious undertaking, given that so many
quality control issues could have gone wrong with it, but it turned out
very nicely. Though it is a little odd seeing that his legs are hollow
when looked at from one side, all the parts fit together very well and
stay together under a reasonable amount of pressure, so no worries about
Prime collapsing into his legs here. Optimus also has fantastic articulation,
especially for a Titanium-- he can move at the shoulders (at three points),
elbows (at two points), head, waist, hips (at two points), and knees (at
two points). He's a tad back-heavy if you've got his ladder assembly behind
him, so that can limit the poses he can pull off a little bit, but otherwise
he's got quite a few poses in him. Also, in case you're wondering, Titanium
RiD Prime has fairly few diecast parts-- his arm-guns, his shoulders, his
chest, and his feet are diecast, but that's it.

    Titanium RiD Prime is
a fantastic rendition of the character, with a very interesting and unique
transformation that actually improves on the original in some respects,
especially in the robot mode. The rather fakey-looking front half of the
vehicle mode is the only thing keeping him from claiming best 6" Titanium
to date at this point. Highly recommended.

      Chosen by the Matrix to lead the Autobots
on their mission to Earth, Optimus Prime is the very embodiment of all
that every Autobot strives to be. He is the soul of honor and compassion,
dedicated to the preservation of life and freedom for all creatures. His
affection for those he protects is matched only by his ferocity in battle.
he has faced them many times, and knows that there can be no surrender
and no compromise with the treacherous Predacons.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      In addition to being an ideal leader,
he is a war machine of incredible power. Nearly unbeatable in single combat,
his enemies have resorted to an endless string of dirty tricks to lay him
low, only to see him rebound every time, stronger than ever before. His
strength and confidence, however, hide a deeply reflective spirit. During
solitary moments, he has been known to doubt his skill as a leader, for
his deep compassion has - at times - clouded his judgement. Thankfully,
his brilliant mind and the dedication of his compatriots have always managed
to snatch victory from the evil claws of the Predacons.
