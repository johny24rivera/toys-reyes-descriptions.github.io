    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Tarantulas. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Beast Wars Tarantulas

     Compared to the previous
paint job this version of Tarantulas had, the 10th Anniversary Edition
has some moderate changes, but nothing particularly groundbreaker. The
main changes when compared with the original are the placement and color
of paint apps on the head-- they are now pretty much 95% show-accurate
now, with the only difference being the fact that the back of the head
isn't painted purple like the front, which is a pretty minor issue. The
yellow used for the decorate stripes on the spider back and mandibles has
been dulled considerably, and the green has been mellowed out a bit into
a more "swampy" feel. This new shade of green looks pretty good, but a
bit "purer" of a green color would have been more show-accurate. The changes
to the other colors when compared to the original version are negligible,
at the most. Tarantulas does sport a spiffy new Predacon insignia on his
spider backside/underside of his gun, however.

     10th Anniversary Tarantulas
(or Tarantulus, if you prefer the copyright-evasion slight name change)
isn't completely show-accurate, but he's definitely much closer than the
original version, and has a neat paint job even when taken by itself. Plus,
he's one of the few early Beast Wars molds that still stands the test of
time and measures up well to quite a few of the new molds today. Mildly
recommended.

       Predacon Tarantulus is the very soul
of treachery. As a Predacon spy, he had every intention of betraying and
destroying Megatron when the time came, but now that he's been stranded
on this stinking, mudball planet his agenda and ambition have grown. Access
to the alien technology of the mysterious Vok has given him a taste of
true power, which he will stop at nothing to claim all as his own.
