    Beast mode is a metallized,
mutated bat with huge claws. Her face is very menacing, and she has metal
wings with some clumps of fur still showing on them. Her wings cant flap
in this mode, though, and her robot legs sort of stick out on the bottom.
Her articulation is also very limited in this mode, basically involving
only her mouth and hind legs.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Her robot mode doesnt
have as many good points as it does bad. Her transmetal orb is under
a piece in her chest. Her claws look even larger in this mode than they
did in beast mode. Her wings sort of look small in comparison to the rest
of the body. Her legs are a little short in comparison to her arms, but
this is no big loss. Her bat legs are very odd-looking, making it look
like she has four arms. Her elbows cant move either, which is a minus.

    A nice transformer,
although kind of weak in robot mode. She is organic on one side but metallic
on the other, which has a nice fusing effect. Her transforming isnt hard
for the most part, but it is very hard to get her legs flipped through
his body. I would just take them off when transforming.

Sonar. Super-acute senses provide matchless reconnaissance abilities, while
bio-cyber elements allow unmatched strength and mobility. When combined
with a fiery, almost uncontrollable aggression, Sonar makes a dangerous
enemy and a somewhat unpredictable ally. Much to his chagrin, Megatron
has unintentionally created the finest early-warning system ever to have
existed - the Maximal known as Sonar.
