    Raptor mode is very cool-
definitely superior to the original
    <a href="dinobot.html">
     Dinobot's
    </a>
    ,
because it has no underbelly extras. It is also more accurate to an actual
raptor- the arms are longer, the legs don't stick out from the body, etc.
As with most Beast Wars toys, the detailing is great, with little ridges
carved everywhere in the plastic. The little asymmetrical design on Razor
Claw's back is nice, too. The claws are amazingly articulated- the big
"raptor claw" can move up and down seperately, the "little toe" can move
from side to side seperately, and the two middle claws can move up and
down together. This articulation can be made into many funny gestures,
such as the peace sign and "Dr. Evil" (Take the little toe out to the side,
bring the big claw a little back, bring the two middle claws all the way
down, and hold it up sideways to the mouth). There are only two minor problems
I have with this mode. For one, the middle of the tail looks odd, because
the tip of the tail is made to revolve between the raptor and wolverine
tails. It's also a little short for a raptor tail, and the neat black lines
on Razor Claw's back don't continue onto the end of the tail like they
should. The second is that the orange on the wolverine feet make them very
noticeable, and not as easy to overlook as the green wolverine legs on
Razor Claw's underbelly. A minor problem is that this toy is very small
for a deluxe- in the wolverine mode especially, it looks like a big basic.
The mutant symbol is on Razor Claw's upper left leg, you can't miss it.
The robot head is viewed by lifting up the panel on the back of Razor Claw's
upper raptor neck and forehead. The robot head looks very weird, kinda
like an insect with a mustache. It has no visible mouth. One cool feature
is that the tip of the robot antennae form the raptor eyes.

    Wolverine mode is pretty
poor, especially when compared with the excellent raptor mode. For one
thing, it's GREEN. Real wolverines aren't green! Hasbro should have picked
a main color for this mutant that could have easily looked right in both
modes, such as brown. (Even the box art has the wolverine mode shown as
brown.) Another major problem is that the back legs are only slightly over
half the size of the front legs! Also, the claw colors don't match- the
back feet claws are orange, while the front feet claws are that lime-greenish
off-white stuff. The detailing in this mode, although greatly crafted,
seems to alternate between parts as that of scales and that of fur, making
this look like one freaky wolverine. The front legs are also clearly raptoresque
in their structure.  Yet another major problem with this mode is that
the wolverine tail actually starts under Razor Claw's stomach, and pokes
out from under the bottom of his rear, another feature that adds to this
mode's oddity. The last, but less major, problem is that the raptor arms
are very noticeable from a head-on view on Razor Claw, as they make up
the bottom neck and chest of the wolverine, and look weird. On the upside,
the posability's pretty good in this mode. :)

    A great raptor mode,
but a very weak wolverine mode.

      Razor Claws loyalty and self-sacrifice
is unmatched by any of the mutants. Goes into battle with crusader-like
enthusiasm; relishes tearing apart Predacons in both dino mode and wolverine
mode. Does not care for Maximals but realizes they are necessary for a
total organic existence. Secretly jealous of their ability to convert to
robot mode. Tremendous speed as wolverine borders on teleportation; negative
ion shield in dino mode makes him impervious to firepower.
