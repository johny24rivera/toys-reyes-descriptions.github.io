    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Obi-Wan Kenobi. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Obi-Wan Kenobi

     The first Star Wars Transformer
repaint is of the Jedi Starfighter mold-- not the best one to do again,
mind you, but not the worst either. The problem is, you can't really change
the colors TOO much on the vehicle mode without going out of the color
scheme limits the movies set. The shade of gray has been changed slightly
from Obi-Wan Kenobi, but that's a negligible change. The location of the
various paint apps is also pretty much identical to Obi-Wan's as well,
though they're different colors, of course. The maroon on Obi-Wan has been
replaced with a dull yellow for Anakin, but that's the only color difference
that immediately catches the eye. Other, more minor changes include the
changing of the bronze paint apps on the legs to brown (hardly a big color
swap) and a few more parts use black plastic. The lightsabers are also
of a lighter shade of blue as well. The main thing that differentiates
Anakin from Obi-Wan is the new head mold. I like this new head a lot--
it's a very generic Transformer head, which is a big plus in my book since
it doesn't look too much like its pilot. There are a few nods to the real
Anakin's face, though, such as the scar near the right optic and a slightly
angry expression on the face. Otherwise, Anakin is the same mold as Obi-Wan.

     Anakin Skywalker has
a nice paint job when looked at by himself, but it's too similar to Obi-Wan's
to justify another use of the mold. The new head looks very good, and I
like it better than Obi-Wan's, but otherwise the original use of this mold
looks better, in my opinion. Not recommended unless you're a completist
or just a big Anakin fan.

       Space battle during the Clone Wars is
certainly a harrowing experience, especially for the most gifted pilot
in the galaxy, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin is given some of the most challenging
flight missions of any Jedi and handles them with great ease. Using the
power of the Force, Anakin changes into Jedi starfighter mode and takes
on an entire squadron of droid tri-fighters by himself!
