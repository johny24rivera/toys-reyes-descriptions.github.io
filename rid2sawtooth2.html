    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original version of
Sawtooth. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
version of Sawtooth

     For Sawtooth's single-packed
version, his colors definitely make for a darker, more evil-looking scheme,
which makes the fact he still has an Autobot symbol a surprise to me. I
mean, I kinda like the idea used with a lot of these Weaponizer Mini-Con
redecoes that the different colors occur whenever a robot of a different
faction wields them. With Sawtooth here though, nope, he's still an Autobot.
He LOOKS more evil, though, and definitely has a very Decepticon-y shade
of deep royal purple used for his legs, weapon mode handle, and painted
on the shark-like crest on the back of his head. The main color this contrasts
off of is a dark rusty red, used for pretty much the entire main body and
arms. It's also a semi-metallic shade of the color, as it has some glitter
mixed in, but even ignoring that it's an excellent shade that definitely
gives this version of Sawtooth a unique feel while still being a fairly
realistic color for a manta ray... or at least, manta ray-like creature,
I guess. To top it all off, Sawtooth has a dynamite shade of bold metallic
teal used on his teeth and eyes. All three colors contrast against each
other extremely well, and is quite frankly one of, if not THE, best Mini-Con
color schemes I've seen in the entire line.

     No mold changes have
been made to the core toy, but the armor pieces for this version of Sawtooth
have been completely changed. First off, they're a transparent blue, which
of course fits in with his "sea" theme, though I don't feel they contrast
against the other colors quite as well as the "core" scheme. There's two
claw pieces that fit over his existing claws, making them MUCH larger and
deadlier-looking. He's also got pieces that fit over his wings and over
the long fin down the center of his back, both of which have very angular
details on them to make them look like they're made of ice. It's a pretty
neat look, and it makes his trident mode look a bit more wicked. I wish
the blue used was a bit of an icy shade, but otherwise no complaints here.
All armor pieces fit on in both modes.

     The single-packed version
of Sawtooth is definitely the superior one, in my opinion, even if his
color scheme isn't quite as conventional for a sea-like creature. The main
colors are all very striking and contrast against each other amazingly
well, and his armor pieces definitely make him more fierce and jagged-looking.
If you can get both versions of Sawtooth fairly easily, I'd go for this
version, but except for a few countries this last wave of single-packed
Weaponizers was hard to get; if you have to pay a high premium for him,
you may just want to stick with the more widespread Battle Pack version
instead-- I mean, the mold's not that great, itself...
