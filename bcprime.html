not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Voyager Optimus

     No, it's not NEMESIS
Prime-- it's EVIL OPTIMUS Prime. There's a difference, and quite a creative
one, at that. "Mirror Universe" Prime's color scheme here is pretty much
a darker interpretation of the classic Prime colors. The red has been turned
into reddish purple to reflect his eeevilness, his yellow is now a dull
bronze, and his blue parts are actually now a very dark bluish black. All
in all, it's quite an impressive color combination, but the paint apps
are what especially make the figure. There's signs of wear-and-tear all
over Evilmus Prime's chassis-- it's obvious the guys too busy being INSANELY
EVIL to worry about keeping his armor polished. There's airbrushed silver
"worn metal" on several places, such as his front bumper and robot legs,
and painted silver apps all over the main cab portion of his vehicle mode
to create the same impression. The crack in the windshield is also a nice
touch, and I REALLY like how there's a "clear" spot on the translucent
on the arcs where the molded-in windshield wipers could reach, but the
rest of the translucent plastic is fogged up a little (not sure how they
did that). There's also a couple of so-chinzy-they're-cool details, like
the large crooked, worn Autobot symbols on the sides of the truck mode,
the neon green lights (which go BRILLIANTLY with the purple and black,
by the way). Best of all there's a "'TILL ALL ARE GONE!" motto emblazoned
proudly on his roof, which appropriate enough becomes his gun in robot
mode. Nice evil touch on the classic Autobot motto, there.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon Optimus Prime.

     Botcon "Evil" Optimus
Prime is simply one of the best-looking Transformers I've ever seen. It's
already one of the best Transformer molds in quite a while, and in an incredible,
original, well-thought-out color scheme to boot. In short: GLEE. BUY IF
CAN. Thank you.

       During Cybertron's Golden Age of peace,
an elite few served as the guardians of Cybertron's accumulated knowledge.
Among these data clerks was Optronix. A low-level operator who sought to
replace those above him, Optronix turned his research skills to finding
methods of manipulation. Eventually, he rose to prominence; however, when
his activities were uncovered, he was removed from service and left purposeless.
Deep in his Ember though, Optronix believed he was best fit to lead Cybertron.
He hungered for power and through his studies, he determined that military
might was the only way to achieve his goals. Preaching a philosophy of
destruction and conquest, he eventually began re-engineering his body as
well as taking on a new name: Optimus Prime. He then began refashioning
the bodies of his followers into weapons as well. Armed with weapons and
a uniting philosophy, he declared his warriors autonomous from the rest
of Cybertron and thus named them the Autobots!
