    Jetfire's vehicle mode
is an old-style large military plane. This mode is one of the best realistic,
non-Alternator alt modes I've ever seen. First, I'll get the two (verrry
minor) complaints out of the way about the mode, and then it's smooth sailing
from there. First, the back of Jetfire's robot head is a little visible
on the topside of the vehicle mode, buit it's partially obscured by the
fact that the shape (except for the white side head crests) mesh very well
with its surroundings, and it's generally the same color, so it's hardly
an eyesore. Also, the main wings can droop a little under all the weight
they're carrying. But that's it-- otherwise, this mode is flawless. The
proportions are spot-on, and there's tons of appropriate detailing where
needed, from metal panel detailing to air vents. There's also ample silver
and red paint detailing where needed to give the appropriate, military-esque
green color scheme a bit more variety. There's large wheels on the underside
of the mode to roll Jetfire along when needed, but there's zero undercarriage
junk-- a rarity for a jet Transformer, which makes this mode all the more
exceptional. He's also got two cool spring-loaded missile launchers under
his wings, which detach in robot mode to become hand-held guns. So all
in all, Jetfire has one fan-spankin-tastic vehicle mode.

    Jetfire's robot mode
is where he falls short, however. Until I bought Jetfire, I thought that
his chest and legs attached vertically with his back section, but this
is not the case. Instead, for no apparent reason, his chest and legs attach
at an odd diagonal angle to his back section. This creates a large, unsightly
gap in Jetfire's main body if you look at him from any angle except head-on,
and it makes his backpack junk stick out more than it should, making him
very back-heavy. Even his large flat feet have trouble keeping him up straight
unless you lean him forward some. In Also, the waist piece connects rather
loosely to the chest piece on many people's Jetfires, though mine does
not have this problem. As for his proportions, although his head and chest
look nice, his legs are a bit shorter than they should be proportionally.
His arms are also really chunky to the point of being almost goofy-looking,
and the red engine "caps" just hang off the back of his elbows in a rather
unsightly manner. His key gimmick is also the lamest of the first wave--
by sticking his key into a slot on his backpack junk, the end "tail" of
the plane flips up abit and two little guns stick out a centimeter or two
more. It's really lame, as it doesn't really accomplish anything and Jetfire
has to lean far forward in this mode to point them at anyone. Plus, you
can't store his key in the slot in vehicle mode. (He can use this gimmick
in vehicle mode, but his tail has to be folded up, which looks really weird.)
For some reason, the electronics in mine don't work, so I can't personally
comment on Jetfire's lights and sounds, but I am told that the rear thrusters
make three different noises-- one in robot mode, another in vehicle mode,
and one with the key inserted. However, Jetfire does have a few positives
in this mode, besides the aforementioned color scheme. For one, I like
how the wings become Jetfire's shoulders-- it gives him a little bit more
of a steamlined look. His head design is also very good, borrowing liberally
from his Armada head design but making the head crests sweep back more.
The red transparent visor also has optics that are visible under it if
you look hard enough. In addition, when you connect his chest to his waist
piece during transformation to this mode, little missile ports pop out
of the side of his chest-- very cool. He also has good articulation-- he
can move at the neck, at the shoulders (at two points), the elbows (at
two points), the waist, the hips (at two points), and the knees. Because
of his aforementioned back-heaviness, however, his poses are a bit more
limited than they would be otherwise.

    Cybertron Jetfire has
an awesome, near-flawless vehicle mode, but his robot mode is a sizable
dissapointment, with proportion and stability problems. What makes it even
worse is that if his chest &amp; waist could just connect to his back piece
vertically, many of these problems would have been solved. He's still by
no means a bad toy, but there are definitely other large figures in Cybertron
that are better.

      This steadfast Autobot is often annoyed
by his hyperactive partner Scattorshot, but he nonetheless takes his duties
very seriously, and will follow through on his orders no matter what. Jetfire
has been assigned by Optimus Prime the difficult tasks of protecting Earth
while keeping the Autobot presence a secret and searching for the Earth
Planet Key. Jetfire would rather be fighting in the front lines alongside
his leader, but his strategic genius and status as the upstanding, honorable
second-in-command of the Autobots make him an invaluable asset at the Autobot
base.
