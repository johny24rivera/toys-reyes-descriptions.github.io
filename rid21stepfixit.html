    Fixit never transforms
in the show, so his alt mode is a bit of a mish-mosh of his robot parts
with the drills that sometimes come out from his fists out in the front,
making this some kind of "futuristic" (and I use that term lightly) personal
drill vehicle. The strongest part of the mode by far is the back end, where
there's handles for someone to hold onto him (in an imaginary sense; the
handles are not 5mm-compatible, unfortunately) and little pad extensions
on the back for someone to stand on him. There's also big wheels detailed
like what you'd expect a driller vehicle mode to have. The front half or
so is mostly weak, though. On the plus side, you've got the two drillers
in the front with little wheels under them, but the parts behind them are
very obviously Fixit's main body and his upper arms, with the shoulder
bits just kinda splayed against the sides of the body. The section behind
THAT is obviously the top of his robot head, though thankfully his actual
face folds away completely in this mode, so at least that doesn't show.
As with most RID2015 toys, his mold detailing is pretty minimal, though
a "ribbed" section on his main body and his drills-- both painted silver--
look pretty good. There's a couple other divots on the main body, but that's
about it as far as mold detailing beyond very basic shapes. His color scheme
is almost entirely a straightforward orange plastic in this mode, though
there is actually a fair amount of light milky gray plastic, used on his
handlebars and on several interior parts that aren't readily visible in
either mode-- thankfully, given that it's that bland shade of the color.
It, the silver, and the black contrast fairly well against the orange,
though it's nothing eye-popping. There's also a bit of pale metallic bronze
around the front drills, and some light blue on the main body-- the metallic
bronze is a nice shade, but blends in with the orange a little much for
my liking. On the other hand, the light blue looks so good against the
orange I wish it was used more.

    To transform Fixit to
robot mode, you just pull down on his gray handlebars until they meet the
orange footpads on the back; the rest of him auto-transforms. (To get him
back to vehicle, you press down on the gray section in the back middle
until the catch releases.) The end result isn't all that different from
the vehicle mode, since so much of this mode is visible in the former mode--
it's just more of the parts rearranged in a humanoid form. Just like in
the show, Fixit doesn't really have feet, just two wheels with vaguely
feet-shaped wedges in front of them to help him stand up. I do wish that
the drills could fold around with actual hands to replace them, though,
as Fixit doesn't actually have his drills deployed much in the show. There's
also the handlebars and entire back portion of the vehicle mode just hanging
behind his butt, which makes him look a bit unsightly from a side view.
However, that's nothing compared to his most annoying issue, which is with
his shoulders; the transformation is SUPPOSED to make his gray shoulder
pieces flush with his body, but they stop juuust a click short of that
and there's a very annoying gap in between his shoulders and main body,
with the shoulders sagging a bit under the weight of the arms. Considering
that Fixit's only articulation is back-and-forth at said shoulders, this
makes him feel a little unstable whenever you pose him, since the shoulders
aren't firmly in place. On the plus side, though, Fixit's face is really
well-sculpted in this mode and spot-on accurate to the show (more accurate
than his Legion toy, in fact), with pale bronze eyebrows, light blue eyes,
and a silver face with a black bit on his headcrest. He has a rather neutral
expression on his face.

    The 1-step version of
Fixit has a better vehicle mode of the two toys of the character, with
actual handlebars and a back end that looks like someone could actually
use him as a drill vehicle, though the rest of his vehicle mode is poor
and obviously just his robot mode parts crashed together in a triangular
vehicle-ish pattern. In robot mode he looks fairly good proportionally,
though he has some big kibble behind his butt, and his shoulders are VERY
annoying as they don't completely sit flush with the rest of the body.
I think in general this is a poor design so I don't think any toys of this
character are good, but if you're going to get a toy of this figure I'd
get the Legion class version instead.
