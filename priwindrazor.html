    Windrazor is a new mold
if you want to get literal, but this toy is about 95% simply an upsized
version of the
    <a href="pricywindrazor.html">
     legion-class Windrazor mold
    </a>
    ,
right down to sharing the same mold detailing. Thus, pretty much all of
my comments on the mold itself are covered in my review of the legion-class
Windrazor.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    As for the changes made
to the mold this time around, the original's bow weapon has been replaced
with a more unique spiky mace weapon which has a long enough handle where
I COULD see it doubling as a gun in vehicle mode, as it does have a port
on the mace head that can connect it to the underside of the wings or also
on top of said wings in beast mode, as well as on the knees and ankles.
The other non-upsizing changes made to Windrazor are minimal; the pegs
on the sides of the feet have been removed as Windrazor no longer needs
to combine with another toy, and the shoulder and hip joints are no longer
ball joints, having been replaced with fricton joints that move at two
points each to allow the toy to better hold up its increased mass. What's
nifty is that there's a rotation joint also added just below the shoulder,
which allows Windrazor's wings in beast mode to assume a considerably more
"natural-looking" pose than they can on the legion class toy. As for the
mold detailing itself, it holds up surprisingly well for being upsized--
for the most part Windrazor is still adequately detailed, particularly
on his main body and neck, with all the cool little interlocking armor
panels. That said, his wings and his arms in particularly could've used
more mold detailing, as they look a bit too simple at this scale. His headsculpt
blown up at this scale also looks a bit "off", and should have been redone.

   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    As for the color scheme
itself, the general "look of it" is largely unchanged from the initial
legion-class Windrazor release, with yellow, green, and purple being the
main colors. The shades of the colors are different this time around, being
a bit less of an homage to G1 Cutthroat. The yellow is more... well...
yellow, with less of a tan influence than on the orignal. The purple is
less violet and more a darker shade, with a really nice metallic shade
of the color used for the paint on the wings. The green is noticeably lighter
and of the seafoam variety, which is a rather negative change, in my view--
it lessens the contrast with the yellow-tan considerably, and makes the
overall scheme just a tad too light outside of the wings where the purple
dominates. There's also a bit of gold on the talons, beak, and face, which
is a nice shade but again I wish was a bit darker to contrast against the
yellow a bit better. The red eyes in both modes pop very well, though.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Deluxe Windrazor looks
decent enough, though the upsides of his up-scaling-- such as better wing
positioning, a unique weapon, and more weapon ports-- aren't as significant
as his downsides, like his less-appetizing green color-- and the fact that
his transformation was already simplistic as a Legion figure, and for a
mainline deluxe figure it's simply unacceptably too simple. Heck, any of
other Terrorcons would've made the transfer to deluxe class better, in
my view. Thus, because of how ridiculously simplistic he is in addition
to the slightly-worse color scheme, I'd only recommend deluxe Windrazor
to Prime Predacon completists (especially since he's already hard-to-get,
only being released in Europe and some Asian markets).

      Review by Beastbot
     </font>
     <p>
      * There was a quite rare variant of this mold sighted in later cases
of this wave that replaced most of Windrazor's colors with a darker shade,
including replacing some of the original's tan with dull gold and gray
plastic, making the purple less metallic, the green darker, and making
the original's gold paint a bit darker. I've never even seen one for sale
on eBay so I'm going solely off of a few select pictures on the Internet
here, but to me the rare gold variant looks better, with better color diversity
and just a generally more unique look. If you're lucky enough to be able
to choose between the two, I'd recommend the gold variant more.
