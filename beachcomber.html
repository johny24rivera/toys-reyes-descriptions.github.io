    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Cliffjumper. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Cliffjumper

     Even though Beachcomber
is a repaint of a toy that had only become widely available just a few
months beforehand, I don't mind. Why? Because Beachcomber is an absolutely
FANTASTIC repaint. For one thing, it's a nice nod to G1 Beachcomber, who
not only had a similar color scheme, but also had a dune buggy alt mode
and a face that at least was somewhat similar to Energon Beachcomber's.
But ignoring that G1 nod completely still doesn't diminish the way the
colors on this guy go togetyher so perfectly. The off-white and blue, with
a bit of yellow thrown it, are actually the colors of the beach, if you
think about it (yellow= sand, blue= sky and water, white= clouds). The
blue especially stands out-- it's hard to explain, but even though it's
not bright, it really contrasts with the other colors to the point that
it catches your eye quickly. The red, silver, and gold paint apps don't
clash at all, and keep the color scheme from getting too repetitive. And
there are plenty of paint apps on Beachcomber, including a rather cool
navy blue "striped" paint app on the sides of the vehicle mode. It looks
really nice against the lighter blue. I mean, really, the only thing I'd
change when it comes to the paint job is that the front half of Beachcomber's
face is blue, while the back half is black-- making it all blue would have
made more sense. But that's it, folks-- every other color is perfect on
this guy where it is.

     No mold changes have
been made to Energon Beachcomber.

     Beachcomber is a pretty
much flawless repaint, so this is as good as this mold is going to get,
folks. Fun to look at, and pretty fun to play with, too. Highly recommended.

       Beachcomber is a young Autobot warrior
responsible for the seaside patrol of Ocean City, one of the Autobot bases
of operation. He is programmed with infrared optic scanners that allow
him to spot an approaching enemy up to five miles away. Whether it is day
or night, few Decepticons have been able to infiltrate Ocean City during
Beachcomber's watch. Although he is very serious about his job as guardian,
Beachcomber likes letting loose with his Autobot comrades. He is a known
trickster and enjoys telling a joke or two... especially when the subject
of the joke is Megatron.
