    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Deluxe Prowl.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe 2.0 Deluxe

     Smokescreen, both in
terms of the overall design of the modes and the color scheme, is a new
"upgraded" version of his
     <a href="g1smokescreen.html">
      G1 self
     </a>
     , and
so has a rally car-esque color scheme. The amounts of the colors are bit
different, though-- there's a bit more white on the vehicle mode due to
thicker stripes, a bit less blue, and the red is a bit lighter. In vehicle
mode, the slightly-changed color scheme is pulled off rather well, though
it's admittedly more loud than the other color schemes this mold has gotten
(but that's always been the case). The "38" decals on the side doors and
in front of the windshield are really plain, though, and look almost hand-made
considering how simplistic they are. I also don't like how the rear windows
are painted a dull blue-- if you're gonna paint some of the windows but
make the others transparent, at least make all of them the same color!
In robot mode, Smokescreen shares a few minor color changes from his G1
self as well-- namely, less black and more of the red/blue colors. It doesn't
look BAD, but still a bit "too" colorful. The original G1 toy had some
nice darker red and more black in robot mode to offset the lighter colors,
and this release of Smokescreen doesn't, which makes him look borderline
garish in robot mode. (One final note-- the red painted parts don't contrast
with the red plastic parts at all, it just appears that way in the above
pictures due to camera lighting.)

     Smokescreen has the
same mold change that Universe 2.0
     <a href="uni2silverstreak.html">
      Silverstreak
     </a>
     does-- that is, the removal of Prowl's headlights-- but otherwise no mold
changes have been made to the toy.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Smokescreen
is a nice G1 homage and the mold certainly isn't bad, but two minor changes
to the classic color scheme-- namely, the lightening up of the red and
the removal of some of the black in robot mode-- make him look lighter
and a bit TOO colorful overall, and as such he's my least recommended of
the three paint jobs this mold has gotten. Go with Silverstreak instead.

       This cunning robot's job is to distract,
disrupt and confuse the enemy. He is a master of misdirection, skilled
at making Decepticons look in exactly the wrong direction at just the perfect
time. More than one Autobot sneak attack owes its success to the skill
of Smokescreen. He enjoys playing games with the enemy, taking a huge amount
of pleasure in the frustration they display.
