    For a Legends class figure,
Megatron's tank mode is surprisingly good. Heck, it looks more like an
actual tank than his larger toys! The turret isn't positioned too high
or low, or amalgamated too much into the actual body of the tank (granted,
for the purpose of movie accuracy it SHOULD be, but as far as looking like
an actual tank, this is closer). The treads on the sides are also quite
well-done, with "shards of metal" sculpted above them. He certainly looks
evil, that's for sure. Heck, the sculpting overall is just spectacular--
it's just particularly good on the treads. Megatron also has quite a lot
of silver paint, which looks fairly nice against the black, and his milky
gray plastic isn't as boring-looking as "milky gray" has tended to look
on TFs lately, since it has a slight metallic sheen to it and matches the
silver closely. Of course, silver-and-black, though not clashy, isn't exactly
an exciting color scheme, but it IS movie-accurate. There are a few complaints
to be had about this mode, though-- the robot head is somewhat visible
from a rear view, and there's no little head peaking up from in between
the front treads like on the other toys of RotF Megatron. The big thing,
though, is that his turret can't rotate. It can move up and down, but not
being able to do such a basic thing as rotate your turret is definitely
a big downside.

    Megatron's robot mode
is easily the poorer of the two modes. His main body is alright-- some
nice detailing, and a fair head sculpt with some nice beady red optics--
but his appendages are a mess. The legs splay out at the hips at a very
awkward angle, and are a bit too stiff-looking. His arms are especially
atrocious-- the lower parts are barely more than sticks (made from parts
of his tank cannon). They don't look like claw-hands by any stretch of
the imagination, and on the contrary make Megatron look really, really
weak with arms that skinny, especially when you compare them to his fairly
large legs. Megatron can move at the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees,
though the knee and elbow movement is only back-and-forth.

    RotF Legends Megatron
has a great vehicle mode-- heck, I'd argue it's far better than the
    <a href="rotfmegatron.html">
     <i>
      Leader
class
     </i>
     version
    </a>
    -- but his robot mode is incredibly awkward-looking,
especially with those teeny twig arms. I'd go for the Voyager instead unless
you're really cash-strapped.
