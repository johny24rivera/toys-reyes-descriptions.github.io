    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Megatron. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Megatron

     Cybertron Galvatron,
especially when compared to Cybertron Megatron, is definitely one of the
best improvements in a paint job a toy has EVER gotten. The silver used
on most of Galvatron isn't actually chrome (so you don't have to worry
about it chipping), but it gives off a very, VERY cool shiny metallic sheen.
I've never seen a color this shiny used on a Transformer before that wasn't
chrome. Gray is used on parts that undergo a lot of scraping together during
transformation or in movement in either mode, so that the shiny metallic
isn't scratched to make it look worse. I'm not sure why the front of the
head is shiny silver while the back half is suddenly gray, but that's the
only place where those two colors don't quite fit together. The black and
red, when combined with all the silver, make Galvatron look like he's positively
dripping with evil. Many of the accent colors fit in perfectly as well-
the purple face is very Decepticon-y, and the metallic bronze goes very
well with the silver. The red plastic could maybe stand to be just a shade
darker, but other than that no complaints whatsoever with his color layout.
I especially like the new paint app on the cockpit seat-- painting over
part of the window makes the window almost look like a narrowed eye, VERY
cool.

     No mold changes have

     Galvatron is an absolutely
incredible repaint, I can't possibly see this mold getting any cooler.
The color scheme quality gap between this toy and Megatron couldn't be
greater. Highly recommended.

       The rage Megatron feels after his defeat
by Metroplex activates the dormant power within his Unicron armor. This
vast energy draws power directly from the Giant Planet itself, feeding
it into Megatron and changing him into the mighty Galvatron! A living engine
of destruction, Galvatron lives only to conquer all and grind the Universe
beneath his armored heel. His weapons and intellect super-charged by the
living energy of the Giant Planet, there are none powerful enough to stand
in his way!
