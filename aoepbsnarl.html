    Snarl's traditional dino
mode of a stegosaurus makes it into the Age of Extinction line, though
like the other AoE Dinobots, he's really ridged and spiky and generally
more "EXTREME", to borrow a popular toy phrase from the '90s. He's also
not in the movie at all, but included mostly because of the G1 Dinobots'
lineup. For the Power Battler version, Snarl's stegosaurus mode has many
positives, but some negatives dragging him down proportionally-- let's
get to the latter first. From a front-on view, Snarl's simply too wide--
about a third or so wider in the body than he should be, really. This is
primarily due to his gimmick, I'd assume (discussed later). Also due to
his gimmick, his back plates are in two very odd rows-- the back plates
should be alternating and very close to each other, but these are in two
distinct rows rather far apart from each other on the body, with the plates
NOT alternating but in fact all coming out of the back at the same place
if you look at him from the side. The tail is also a bit short and stunted
proportionally. All of this drags down Snarl's alt mode a bit, though not
as much as it would have if he were a realistic-looking stegosaur. Other
than the slightly noticeable fists on the rear legs and juuust the tip
of the robot waist piece sticking out below his stomach, he doesn't have
any robot extras in this mode at all, so that's a big plus. As for the
mold detailing, Snarl has the usual bunch of spikes everywhere, with his
mostly concentrating on the bottom of his tail and on simply making his
back plates more pointy-- that said, only the middle (unpainted yellow,
which are noticeably duller than the painted yellow) back plates are actually
of a softer rubbery plastic. None of the spikes are nearly sharp enough
to actually poke someone, though, so no worries about that. There's also
quite a lot of interlocking, armor plate-like detailing on his legs and
along the sides of his main body. His stegosaurus head actually looks a
bit ugly, but in a good way-- it has a bit of a "pig snout" with some extra
little spikes above his eyebrows and the back of his head (because clearly
he didn't have enough already). He also has sharp, carnivore-style teeth,
despite the fact that he's supposed to be a plant-eater-- but given the
style, I don't think realism is at all the main point here. For a color
scheme, Snarl largely has a dark jungle/forest green for most of his dino
mode, with most of his plates painted yellow. The green/yellow combo works
fairly well, given their spots on the color wheel, though the yellow paint
on most of the plates and on the sides of the front part of his body is
a bit lighter/brighter than I'd like. There's a hint of other colors--
some silver on the teeth, some dark metallic gunmetal gray on the neck,
some black on the back, and some fuchsia on some small parts of his rear
legs and gimmick trigger, but they aren't numerous/large enough in this
mode to really make a substantial contribution to the overall scheme, beyond
breaking up the green and yellow a bit. For articulation in this mode,
Snarl can move back-and-forth at the shoulders, and his head can look downwards
a bit at the neck as a side effect of his transformation-- though if you
do this too much, the segmentÂ  where the neck meets the body comes
up too far above the main body and it looks weird, so it's best only to
move him here a little. In general that's pretty poor articulation-- I
understand poseability isn't the point of Power Battlers, but I don't see
why some knee articulation at the dino legs couldn't have been possible.

    Snarl's transformation
is a simplified version of his deluxe toy's transformation, with the front
section folding down to become his legs while his tail splits in half and
connects behind his rear legs and folds out to become his robot arms. The
end result is a pretty unique-looking Dinobot-- in (mostly) a good way.
I love how the tail halves fan out behind his shoulders-- they enhance
his silhouette quite a bit. The way his feet (complete with the usual AoE
Dinobot "spiky knight shoes") fold out from his neck and head is also pretty
well-done. That said, I wish the dino feet on the sides of his robot feet
could fold away or something-- they're REALLY darned obvious and there's
not even an attempt to hide them, so at first glance it looks like Snarl
actually has four feet in this mode. The arms are also eternally in a "flexing
strongman" pose, which doesn't look too great. I'm also not a big fan of
the headsculpt-- it's definitely the least knight-like out of all the AoE
Dinobots' heads. There's a visor, sure, but it's ridged, there's obvious
teeth below said visor in an odd, stretched-out grin, and the way the silver
"front" of his face is painted and sculpted it looks like he's wearing
some odd mask as opposed to a knight helmet. His neck is also overly bulky.
That said, his other robot mode detailing is quite good, from the robotic
"ab" detailing on his stomach to the rather unique "sunburst" patterns
on his chest to the ridged armor on the hips. There's also a bit more color
added to this mode, with the fuchsia plastic (and metallic fuchsia paint)
becoming more apparent, particularly on the abs, where it contrasts wonderfully
with the green and the silver on the sides of the stomach. I really wish
the metallic fuchsia was used more on the toy, it looks wonderful. As for
Snarl's Power Battler gimmick, if you pull down on the fuchsia handle on
his back the plates there will spring forward out of and in front of his
head, though I'm not quite sure what weapon they're supposed to emulate.
The packaging says it's "Hammer Strike" action, but the stegosaurus plates
don't look remotely like a hammer. "Upper back strike action" doesn't sound
as great, I suppose. At least it doesn't cripple the toy, like some other
Power Battler gimmicks. (Of note is that this action feature can't be used
in beast mode, despite the trigger being present.) As for articulation,
Snarl can move back-and-forth at the shoulders, and at the hips (at two
points), knees, and ankles. I really wish he had some elbow and further
shoulder articulation, but honestly that's pretty good articulation for
a toy from this line, even if it doesn't meet the higher standards of the
"Generations" mainline AoE toys.

    Power Battlers Snarl
may not be quite as good as the deluxe toy, but he's definitely one of
the best Power Battlers toys, with a pretty nice-looking robot mode with
good articulation (for the subline), a decent stegosaurus mode (width aside),
and a decent color scheme with the fuchsia really making it pop in robot
mode. His gimmick is rather odd, but it doesn't affect the rest of the
toy much, so at least there's that. Recommended for fans who love movie
Dinobots but aren't quite up to the task of more complex transformations
(particularly with more-brittle translucent plastic, as the deluxe version
has).
