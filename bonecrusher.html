    Beast mode is a buffalo.
This mode is very well crafted and extremely nice-looking. However, he
doesnt have that many moveable joints in this mode, and his robot head
can stick out a little bit from above his beast head.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Robot mode has a lot
of extras, and his face looks a bit odd. Buffalo flesh parts stick out
all over his body and get in the way, like his flesh plates on his legs,
shoulders, and waist. He has no hand weapons, but he does have a missle
that can shoot out of his mouth. His face is very long and odd-looking,
and it cant face forward very well, as it bends back to face straight
up often, without any locking lever. You pull his tail at the end of his
head to fire his mouth missle. Other than that, a nicely crafted mode,
with open hands and bulky feet.

    A nice transformer;
has an odd shaped head and a lot of extras in robot mode, though.

      As stubborn as he is strong, nothing
can stop the brawny Bonecrusher when he charges into battle to crack some
skulls! Like a living locomotive with a one-track mind, all he wants to
do is fight, fight, fight! Optimus Primal tries to get him to lighten up,
if only to prevent him from overheating an internal coolant co-processor,
but Bonecrusher would rather be out pounding his enemies into cyber scrap.
His favorite attack strategy is to stun opponents with a dizzying head-butt,
and then finish them off with a fast firing missile shot straight from
his mouth!
