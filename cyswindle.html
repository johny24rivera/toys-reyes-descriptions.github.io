    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Hardtop. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Hardtop

     ybertron Swindle is a
homage to G1 Swindle, in terms of his alt mode and general color scheme.
Though really, even though given the name it's obvious to see what Transformer
this is a homage to, it's not really obvious by itself-- for one, G1 Swindle
was orange, not yellow, and second, G1 Swindle's alt mode was a jeep, not
a sand rover. But regardless, the new color scheme looks fairly good on
the mold, and is certainly fitting for a sand rover. Although I'm not too
fond of yellow being the main color on a toy in most cases, I do have to
admit Swindle's secondary colors of dull maroon, bluish black, and grayish
brown all complement each other and the yellow pretty well, and there aren't
any really big spots of yellow without some nice contrasting paint apps
to darken things up a bit. That said, as is the case on most TFs, the bluish
black really would look better on the figure as just a solid regular ol'
black. Nearly all of the paint apps are also the same on Swindle as they
were on Hardtop in terms of their placement-- I'd have preferred more different
paint apps on a mainline repaint of a relatively recently-released mold.
I do like the fact that the Decepticoon symbol was moved from the front
of the vehicle mode to the chest of the robot mode, a much more appropriate
place for it.

     Cybertron Swindle is
a decent repaint with some nice contrasting colors, but having a mostly
yellow Transformer just doesn't look as good to me as a mostly dark green
Transformer, which is why I still recommend Hardtop over Swindle.

       Though he is outfitted with a sensor
package and weapons system nearly identical to his twin brother Hardtop,
Swindle scorns long-range tactics. He'd rather charge an Autobot and club
him across the visual cluster with his laser rifle than actually use it
to blast another robot. Swindle is deceptively agile and tough for his
size, traits developed over years of picking fights and winning. He's not
as slavishly loyal to Megatron as his brother; he'll work for anyone who
lets him trash Autobots.
