    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Override.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Override

     Override GTS, in very
general terms, has the same color scheme as her original version. However,
the shades, as well as the amounts, of said colors, have been altered to
a pretty good extent. The white on the original Override has been replaced
with a very light gray, and this, coupled with the much greater amounts
of black, considerably darkens Override GTS' color scheme (especially on
the silver-and-black head, which looks MUCH better than on the original
Override), and looks very good in contrast to the red, which is generally
in the same place as it was on the original toy. The biggest change in
the red comes in terms of the paint patterns, with some really nice-looking
flame patterns on the front of the vehicle and on the lower chest and upper
legs in robot mode. The red used on the rear fins and the gun tips is of
a lighter color, however, and it doesn't look so hot. It is a shame that
the transparent plastic was taken away from the cockpit and wheels, however--
I liked the transparent wheels on the Speed Planet figures...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Override GTS-- even when it comes to the original toy's ability
to stay together well in robot mode, sadly. The gun barrels' problem of
pointing slightly inward when deployed hasn't been fixed either.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Override GTS is a fine
repaint when taken by itself, but overall I feel that a color scheme that
was a bit more different than the original Override's should have been
applied. Couple that with the fact that this is one of the worst (new)
molds in Cybertron, and you're better off staying away from this toy unless
you're a completist.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Override channeled her frustration at
being beaten by both Megatron and Hot Shot into the search for the Planet
Keys. Tempered by a race for something greater than a mere trophy, she
returns to the Speed Planet a new leader. She has upgraded her systems
with components based on the technology of both Earth and Cybertron. With
her body thus enhanced, she has come back to the Speed Planet to reclaim
her place as leader so that she may rule with compassion and justice learned
from the Autobots.
