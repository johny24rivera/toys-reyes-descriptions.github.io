    Sky Lynx's vehicle mode
is-- just like his G1 "combined" form-- a space shuttle with a significant
undercarriage, which is meant to be one of those massive treaded carriers
that transport space shuttles. The space shuttle portion of this mode looks
pretty good; the wings tend to bend upwards slightly from the body (see
the pic above for a pictorial indication of what I'm talking about) and
should probably be a bit larger, but by and large the space shuttle section
is proportional. There's plenty of great mold details, from little windows
to "bolt" paneling to little technical detailing and all that. Given the
breakup of the plastic parts-- and the two little white "ears" behind the
cockpit-- it's a bit TOO obvious where Sky Lynx's head separates, even
compared to the original G1 toy. Then again, I guess part of this comes
with the territory of there being "seam lines" in a white plastic alt mode.
The undercarriage portion of this mode, however, is just unseemly and quite
frankly ugly. It would be one thing if you could "detach" it from the space
shuttle portion, but you can't. There aren't really any visible treads
or anything on this lower portion, just two large white bits that sorta
kinda look like wheels, but are actually Sky Lynx's shoulders and hips
in beast mode (and shuttle carriers don't have wheels this big anyways).
It significantly takes away from the sleekness of this mode, sticking out
quite obviously from the space shuttle portion of this mode, and the rear
beast legs also stick out behind the rear end of the shuttle, which is
definitely an eyesore and my biggest issue with this mode. It's all just
very inelegant. As for the color scheme, Sky Lynx has rather patriotic
colors of white, pale red, and blue, with the white being most prominent
in this mode. There's also a bit of light milky brownish gray used for
Sky Lynx's two gun weapons (plugged onto the underside of his wings in
this mode), as well as for some minor connector parts. I really don't like
this brownish gray, but the white, blue, and red contrast against each
other fairly well. The top portion of this mode would be pretty bland without
paint, but thankfully, there's a decent amount of pale gold used to make
out some details, such as the cockpit windows, the side windows, the rear
thrusters, and some venting details on the rear wings. There's also a big
ol' gold-rimmed Autobot symbol on each wing. All this said, I still wish
a bit more gold as added here, as the middle section in particular has
too much unbroken white on it. It should also be mentioned that Sky Lynx's
rear side tailfins can be folded up or down in this mode, but the joints
aren't that tight-- they tend to sag downwards pretty easily.

    As per the G1 toy, Sky
Lynx's beast mode is more the shuttle mode with a neck and four legs sticking
out of the main body. If you look at the vehicle mode and the robot mode,
you can correctly guess about 90% of the transformation without even having
to look at the instructions or the underside. (The only part that isn't
immediately obvious is that part of the bottom opens out to let the front
legs fully rotate out and unfold.) Here Sky Lynx does a decent job imitating
his G1 toy-- at least from the hips up. The lengthening of the nosecone
into Sky Lynx's neck and head is quite well done, and his neck is pretty
articulated to boot. A panel from the top of the shuttle mode also flips
back to cover up a line of robot bits that otherwise would've been uncovered
by folding out the neck-- something that wasn't necessary, but still very
much appreciated. The wings are flipped forward into a position more like
that of a bird, though the blue flip-out blades that make them into longer
bird wings seem like they were put in the wrong way, even though they actually
weren't. The wings look a bit odd, regardless. The rear half of the space
shuttle portion is basically unchanged, though the tailfin folds out into
a tail. It's a rather puny tail by itself, but you can combine the two
gray weapons onto the end of it to give Sky Lynx a tail that's much better-looking
and prportionally longer. The expected legs fold out from the bottom--
exposing more of the red in particular, but some more blue as well-- but
unfortunately, they're only half good (and devoid of paint). The front
legs look pretty decent-- nice and chunky, as befits a beast of Sky Lynx's
size, though the combiner ports are pretty obvious in the lower legs. The
rear legs, however, are really unfortunate-looking and easily my biggest
complaint about this mode. They're just jointed in completely the wrong
way due to them having to form part of a combiner torso, and the blue paw
pieces look really weird, like they're sticking just barely out below half
of his red lower leg that should be vertical, but is instead horizontal
because of the odd joints. On the other hand, Sky Lynx does have some pretty
good articulation for a beast-former in this mode; he can move at the neck
(at four points; five if you include a white flap at the back of the neck),
at the jaw, up-and-down at the base of the wings, back-and-forth at the
mid-point on the wings, at two points on the tail, at the shoulders (at
two points), front knees (at two points), slightly at the front ankles,
and at the hips, rear knees (at two points), and slightly at the rear ankles.

    Sky Lynx's torso mode--
named "Sky Reign"-- emphasizes the "Lynx" portion of his beast mode, which
on the original G1 toy was formed from the shuttle carrier portion of the
vehicle mode. This time, the "lynx" aspect is mostly kept to the head,
which is an excellent headsculpt-- pretty much spot-on G1 but with more
detailing. The gold head and dark blue eyes really work well together.
Blue is more of a color factor here, in keeping with the "G1 lynx half"
theme of Sky Lynx here, with some nice gold vent details on the torso and
a LOT of robotic detailing on the blue areas-- it's a shame not much of
it is detailed with paint, as there's little vents, panels, "bolts", and
circuitry lines everywhere. The back end of Sky Lynx's beast mode makes
for an excellent chest, and the tailfin folds down on the chest pretty
solidly. The front legs of Sky Lynx's beast mode fold together very nicely
to form the upper legs-- no complaints there at all. The rear legs fold
up to form the shoulders, and it LOOKS nice here, but unfortunately there
isn't anything pegging in these parts-- as such, when you're trying to
move an arm attached to this mode back, the rear hip ratchets behind the
chest may move back instead, which is a bit annoying. The wings are obvious
extras, but enhance the silhouette some, methinks, and the blue "blade"
pieces stick upwards behind the head, looking pretty nice (though the joints
on these pieces are loose enough where they can fall back down of their
own accord, unfortunately). The biggest downside to this mode is the very
odd Sky Lynx head and neck sticking right out of Sky Reign's butt. You
are supposed to fold it up behind the torso and out of the way-- perhaps
it's supposed to be some kind of tail?-- but it still looks very odd, and
the joints aren't quite strong enough to keep it folded up-- often the
neck will slouch down until the whole neck/head section is pointed straight
out behind Sky Reign's rear. As for the gray double-barreled gun accessories,
they can either be plugged in on the wings behind the back in this mode
or on the sides of the upper legs, on the bottom of the blue paws. As for
articulation in this mode, Sky Reign can move at the neck, hips (at two
points-- one of them limited rotation), at the blue blades on the wings
on his back, where the tailfins meet the chest on the front, and the same
articulation on the "tail" that Sky Lynx has on his neck in beast mode.

    Sky Lynx is certainly
the most unique of the Combiner Wars voyagers, having a vehicle mode and
a beast mode instead of a robot mode. However, although his torso mode
is largely awesome (some weak joints and odd tail aside), his shuttle mode
has some significant kibble problems that really bring it down a huge notch.
The beast mode is a fair bit better, being somewhere in between the quality
of the two other modes, with some nice proportions and articulation but
some oddities that mostly come from also having to form a torso, such as
oddly jointed rear legs and weird-looking wings. Mildly recommended if
you want to use him as a combiner, especially if you're looking for something
a bit different than your usual torso 'bots. However, if you simply want
an updated stand-alone Sky Lynx, you're going to have to wait longer--
the G1 toy still outshines this update in that respect.

      Sky Lynx talks about himself as one
of the most accomplished Autobot warriors. Now that he has mastered the
power of combination, he really has something to brag about. His new combined
form, Sky Reign, is a ferocious Combiner beast!
