    Beast mode is an ankylosaurus.
Slapper is one of the two Transformers: Dinobots that is a brand new mold
for the U.S. (although not for Japan); that of Bazooka from Beast Wars
Neo. Although the mold detailing and paint detailing on this mode is VERY
good, this mode suffers from two very severe problems. The first is lack
of good articulation- all Slapper can move in this mode is his jaw, his
legs at the hips, and his tail in one place that looks rather unnatural.
So he's pretty much stuck in a "backed-into-a-corner" pose as shown above,
which really, REALLY limits his playability. The second is that half of
his robot mode sticks out pretty obviously from below his armor plating,
which ruins the look quite a bit. Also, Slapper's light red paint tends
to come off a bit easier than I'd like, especially since it's on all those
pointy spikes that can easily scrape on something. Oh, and that Autobot
sigil on his forehead looks a bit stupid. As for his "gimmick" in this
mode, push up on his tail until it locks into positon, then press the spike
sticking a bit out of his left side (it's camoflauged rather nicely, actually)
to activate a "tail slamming" gimmick in which it reverts back to its normal
postion. The spring's rather weak, though, and it doesn't always work on
both Slapper and his original mold, Bazooka...

    Before I get to the
robot mode, an important word on the transformation of this 'bot: It's
VERY annoying. It's rather easy to transform him into robot mode from beast
mode, but visa versa is a pain in the butt, as you have to position each
of his parts in an almost-exact position to get everything to fit correctly.
It's not fun at all.

    As for the robot mode,
it's quite a bit better than the beast mode when it comes to articulation-
his head, shoulders, elbows, right hand, hips, knees, and feet (in 2 places)
can move, which makes him pretty darn posable- although his feet are a
little small, which affects his stability some. And, although the paint
detailing is pretty good, it definitely shows that Slapper needs some more
color variety- he's almost entirely just red and silver-gray, with just
a little bronze and green. Some more colors on, say, his legs or arms would
have been appreciated. However, I REALLY like Slapper's face- the horn
cap and the horned bronze "beard" really look awesome. The Autobot sigil
is tatooed on his belly- over a Beast Machines Dinobot spark crystal. Meh,
that's kinda cheap, if you ask me. Slapper also has his ankylosaurus head
for a left hand, but it actually looks pretty good, considering that it
doesn't hinder the rest of the arm and serves as a kind of "claw". What
really bugs me about this mode, though, is that his ankylosaurus shell
parts are hanging all over the place! And they don't really look like much
or attach to any body part to lock them in place, so they're basically
just useless kibble. Meh.

    Slapper suffers from
some major problems in both of his modes concerning the obvious showing
of parts of the mode he's not in. Because of this and some articulation
problems in beast mode, Slapper's only a very mediocre transformer.
