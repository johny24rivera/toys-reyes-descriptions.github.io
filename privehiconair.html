    The flying Vehicons finally
get their own mold to help you fill out the Decepticons' rank-and-file,
and their alt mode is basically a flying car. The proportions in this mode
are generally pretty close to the show, with the exception of the cockpit;
the cockpit window and roof barely stick above the front nosecone area,
which looks a bit weird. There should also be side windows, considering
how much the central section should look like a car. There are a few robot
parts visible in this mode, but they're both pretty minor. On the back
end, you can see Air Vehicon's head poking out a little bit from the bottom,
and on the front end, you can see a bit more mass there than there should
be (because of the feet below the front of said nosecone). The mold detailing
is a bit sparse, emphasizing the aerodynamic, sleek feel of the car-jet,
but there's a few lines where needed, and I love all the myriad wings and
fins on the back end-- it helps make the Air Vehicon look a bit more angular
and jagged, thus making him look a bit more evil-looking. The color scheme
in this mode is rather boring, however-- it's almost entirely dark purple.
Not a bad color in and of itself, but the black window and metallic violet
paint on some minor details on the sides are it as far as other colors--
a few more paint apps would have been greatly appreciated, here. For a
weapon, the Air Vehicon comes with the chainsaw-gun that comes with many
other Beast Hunters legion-class figures, done up in a nice dark bluish
gray that works well for such an accessory. There are four total peg holes
to insert Cyberverse-compatible weapons into in this mode-- one on each
of the large wings, and one on each side, a bit in front of the cockpit,
allowing you to give the Air Vehicon a pretty good amount of weaponry if
you so desire. (That said, the hinges for the main wings are JUST weak
enough where they sag slightly underneath the weight of having a weapon
pegged into them. It's not a huge deal, but worth noting.)

    Air Vehicon's transformation
is very simple, even for a Legion-- you just fold back the middle-and-wing
shell section, then slide up the arms and flip out the feet. This means
that all his robot mode detailing is on the underside of his vehicle mode,
but it looks pretty good and accurate to the TV show model, with the "window/chestplate"
and all the required jagged edges on the shoulders, knees, and feet. The
color scheme is also broken up a bit more with some nice dark metallic
gunmetal gray-- so dark, in fact, that unless you have light shining right
on it it looks black. Some silver on the chest and head, a light red visor,
and a bit more violet detailing means that this mode has considerably more
color variety, even if the dark purple still dominates. The proportions
are quite good in this mode, though everything looks a bit overly stiff,
and I'm not necessarily talking about articulation-- appendages can be
molded to look like they're in a more natural position, but here they're
molded ramrod straight, which just looks a bit off, even on a toy this
small. The wings fold out nicely behind the back and help accentuate the
silhouette of the toy fairly well, though I wish they locked in some place.
For articulation, the Air Vehicon can move at the shoulders (at two points),
hips, and slightly forward at the ankles-- more-or-less average for the
size class. His feet are a bit too small to keep him all that stable, though,
so he tends to lean forward due to how said feet transform at the ankles--
an annoyance, albeit a minor one. Of course, as you'd expect he can hold
any Cyberverse-compatible weapon in either of his hand holes.

    Air Vehicon isn't bad
in either mode for such a small toy, though he does have a few minor annoyances,
like an "off" cockpit section, lack of color variety in vehicle mode, and
an overly stiff robot mode with wings that don't "settle in" anywhere.
He's pretty much your average Legion-class toy in nearly every aspect--
not bad, but not amazing either, and his transformation is a bit too simple
and boring, if you ask me. He's certainly a must for those who want to
beef up their Prime Decepticon troops, but as a toy he's rather unremarkable
in every aspect.
