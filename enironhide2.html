    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Energon Ironhide
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Energon
Ironhide toy

     "Energon" Energon Ironhide's
color scheme is a definite throwback to G1 Hound, as is especially evident
in his vehicle mode. He's got pretty much the same shade of green that
Hound had, and a similar white star emblazoned on his front. The sparkly
dark blue also goes ideally with the green, and really complements it.
I can't think of any pair of colors that'd go better together on this mold,
in fact. The only color on Energon Ironhide that I think could use a little
improvement is the mustardy tan used for his upper arms, legs, and feet;
it still looks alright, but a plain tan might have been better. However,
I can see why Hasbro didn't just use that color, since the original Ironhide
had a tan color on those same parts too, so the slightly different color
used on Energon Ironhide is to differentiate the two. Plus, this mustardy
yellow looks a bit dirtier, like Ironhide's seen some more action than
his earlier version. One thing I also find attractive on this toy is that
it's got oodles of great silver paint apps- including a great deal on his
legs and arms in robot mode. And, as far as I can tell, only two (rather
minor) paint apps on the original version aren't on this one, so Energon
Ironhide has a net gain of paint apps, definitely. In fact, his gold Autobot
"Powerlinx" symbol, which was on one of his windows on the previous version,
has been moved down below the window so that said window can be filled
in a with a nice silver paint apps. So no unpainted windows on this guy.

     Energon "Energon" Ironhide
is a great repaint (albeit uncreatively named). He's also a nice nod to
G1 Hound. So, even though the original version of Energon Ironhide didn't
necessarily have a bad color scheme, I'd recommend this version over the
previous one. I really can't see this mold looking much better than this.

       Energon Ironhide's enhanced strength
and physical upgrade have made him an impressive warrior and a feared adversary.
Under the direction of Hot Shot and Jetfire, Ironhide has matured into
a fine Autobot soldier. He has proven time and again that he is brave and
reliable during battle. His skill and courage have been noticed by Optimus
Prime on many occasions and recently earned him the spark of combination.
Energon Ironhide continues to work at developing his skills and is always
willing to stand alongside his Autobot comrades, especially Hot Shot.
