       Oh, joy. Another lazy
Universe Exclusive. For this guy, what you do is you take the light gray
parts from the previous version and replace them with black, then replace
the yellow highlights and Autobot symbol with a red one. Nothing else has
changed. Well, except for the WIDE LOAD sticker on the back end, which
is sure to get a few guffaws. I do have to say, I like the black-and-blue
better than the older gray-and-blue, so if this were a first release of
the mold, or if the previous version was completely different, I'd like
the scheme a lot. But it's just too similar to the previous one to make
me go anything more than "meh". But at least it's more different from the
previous version than the Super Universe Magnus was from his previous scheme.

          Universe Ironhide's vehicle
mode looks pretty cool, and is a pretty big departure from his previous
versions, which is plus when it comes to Universe Exclusives. The black
truck with a silver bed looks really nice, and he has some different paint
decoes, too- a nice line across his sides with some yellow-to-red stripes,
and "4WD" written across the sides in small lettets, too. On his hood are
two red rectangular dots and the standard Autobot symbol. One thing that
rather irks me, though, is that on the rear of this mode is a sticker that
says "ESCORT VEHICAL". Such an obvious mispelling should not have made
it to the final product, and there's absolutely no excuse for it. It's
just more proof that these Universe Exclusives were far too rushed. Another
big indicator is that the actual robot parts- that is, the parts you can't
see from the package- aren't changed at all. They're still the same yellow
and off-white that they were on the RiD version. At least put some EFFORT
into BOTH modes if you're going to repaint something, Hasbro.

           Both of the toys in this
two-pack have pretty good color schemes, if looked at by themselves. But
both of them have colors on them on certain parts that are exactly the
same as their predecessors, and this they only look like "half-repaints".
And they're not really amazing toys, either. Not recommended.
