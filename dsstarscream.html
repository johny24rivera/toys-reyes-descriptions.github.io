    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Voyager Starscream toy

     Deep Space Starscream
is essentially the "Premium Edition" of the character, just released as
a Target Exclusive. Unlike the tan that many early movie publicity stills
had him, Starscream in the movie was actually silver, a color which Deep
Space Starscream matches perfectly. He's got a lot of that lovely metallic
silver paint, which looks EXTREMELY well-done. He's not completely covered
in it like, say,
     <a href="premjazz.html">
      Premium Jazz
     </a>
     , but it's definitely
enough to make him look REALLY nice. (Most of his backside in robot mode
and his robot arms are still gray, though.) I especially like the paint
wash added to the robotic detailing on his chest, elbows, and face, as
they REALLY help to bring out all the little mechanical details there.
The accent colors of red, dark gray/black, and dull gold also work exceptionally
well against the silver and gray, so no complaints there. (On a side note,
the "TFW" on Starscream's wings is short for one of the biggest TF news
sites, TFW2005.com.)

     Deep Space Starscream
is another repaint that really should have been done that way in the first
place. The color scheme would have been rather dull otherwise, with only
a few nice accent colors, but the metallic silver paint on three-quarters
of his body, plus the black paint wash on the robotic details, really makes
the toy. Recommended over all previous releases of this mold.

       Fleeing the catastrophic battle that
led to the destruction of Megatron, Starscream retreats to a nearby power
plant where he can siphon enough raw energy to repair himself of the minor
damage he has suffered from human weapons. His frame repaired and reenergized,
he boosts out of the atmosphere, headed for deep space. As he accelerates
past the moon, he sets his sensors to long-range scan, hoping to find evidence
of nearby Decepticon reinforcements he can bring back to Earth to destroy
the Autobots and their human allies.
