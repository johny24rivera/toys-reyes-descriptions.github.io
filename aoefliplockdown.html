    Lockdown's vehicle mode
for his Flip 'n Change version is a Lamborghini Aventador, just like for
his other AoE toys. For this version, though, vertically this mode seems
to have just a bit more "bulk" proportionally when compared to his length.
It's not a huge difference-- just enough to be noticeable, but it is worth
noting. Otherwise, the proportions in this mode are pretty darn spot-on,
with the mold detailing being particularly impressive-- all the angles
of the Aventador are replicated very accurately on what is AoE Lockdown's
largest toy. The "grills" around the rear taillights and front bumper,
the ridged rear blue section, the triangular designs on the side doors
and the front hood-- it all makes for a mean-looking car, and a fitting
one for Lockdown. Like his other toys, Lockdown's main color is a rather
dark, milky shade of brown-- I would've preferred black, but this version
has a semi-metallic sheen to it which actually looks somewhat similar to
a car finish, so I don't mind it as much as I otherwise would. The silver
paint on the windows and headlights and the dark metallic blue paint on
the rear section also look great, with the silver adding some "light" coloration
to this mode and the metallic blue just looking nice regardless. He is
missing some paint on some important places, though, such as his taillights
and wheel hubs. This being a Flip 'n Change carformer, Lockdown also has
the same issues as
    <a href="aoeflipbee.html">
     Flip 'n Change Bumblebee
    </a>
    in this mode-- that is, rather obvious rectangular bits sticking out just
slightly below where his rear view mirrors are (their blue coloration makes
them even more obvious), and the fact that the front third or so of the
roof doesn't QUITE sit flush with the rest of the vehicle mode, leaving
a noticeable gap that gets worse as you get closer to the bottom of this
"seam". It's not a deal-breaker, but a simple shallow peg would have solved
this-- I'm not sure why Hasbro did it this way.

    Just like other Flip
'n Change carformers, you take apart Lockdown's car mode from the back
end, folding out the arms and then flipping the entire toy around said
arms a few times either one way or another (depending upon which mode you're
transforming him into) and then the transformation's "magically" done.
Because Lockdown shares the exact same transformation scheme as Bumblebee,
he shares the same issues-- namely, the roof and front of the car mode
merely hang behind this mode-- out of the way, but very noticeable and
more and more of an eyesore the more you look at him from a side-on view.
If yours doesn't "lock" into robot mode position solidly enough, this backpack
can also cause him to fall backwards if left standing by himself. He also
has the car doors as shoulders-- completely inaccurate, but they still
function well enough as said shoulders. His arms are also a tad too long
proportionally due to the transformation gimmick, and his articulation
is almost nil-- he can move at the shoulders (at four points; one of them
is shared between both shoulders, meaning if you move one shoulder up and
forward the other will follow due to the gimmick), elbows, and slightly
at the wrists. There's no articulation whatsoever at the head or legs.
That said, the mold and paint detailing for his robot mode bits-- the head,
chest, and legs in particular-- is just awesome. He's got movie-accurate
mold detailing all over the place, like the tubes/pistons on his chest
and abdomen, the "folded metal" on his abdomen and legs, the fake car front-chest,
the relatively large hinged toes, and a pretty good replica of him with
his mask down over his face for a headsculpt (the mask, sadly, cannot be
flipped up). There's plenty of paint on these parts to lighten up this
mode as well-- silver as well as some dark metallic blue, and some metallic
green for his face-mask. These look even better given that much of Lockdown's
robot bits are black, which I think looks better than the dark brown of
his vehicle mode. I wish I could say the same about his arms, which are
sadly unpainted. The blue plastic used for Lockdown's shoulders, upper
arms, and some other minor transformational parts helps to add some more
contrast to this mode, even if it's completely movie-inaccurate.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Flip 'n Change Lockdown
has mostly the same weaknesses as the rest of the carformers in this subline--
namely a bunch of kibble behind his back in robot mode, very little articulation,
and a vehicle mode with a front section that doesn't sit quite flush with
the rest of it. That said, he LOOKS pretty good in both modes, and his
colors are largely pretty good, with some excellent mold detailing and
some pretty good paint detailing as well. As for my copy, out of all my
Flip 'n Change toys this is the one that has the hardest time "locking
in" to the robot mode configuration firmly-- meaning that he can fall over
onto his back easily-- though I'm not sure if this is just my copy. Still,
if you're looking for a simpler-to-transform or a large AoE Lockdown toy,
this is the best one.
