    Drift's Bugatti Veyron
alternate mode looks fantastic all-around, with the proportions very much
spot-on-- as you'd expect for a Transformer with a licensed alt mode. Other
than the swords visible through the transparent windows (the other robot
bits inside said windows are blue enough where they don't really stick
out), there isn't any robot mode bits visible in this mode as well, which
is always a plus. Drift's color scheme is recreated fairly faithfully from
the movie here, with dark blue being the main color, with a nice metallic
teal surrounding the car mode around the bottom rim. As good as these two
colors complement and contrast against each other, though, I do have a
minor beef with them-- for one, the dark blue isn't a metallic or semi-metallic
color, just a flat dark blue, which doesn't work as well on a car as it
doesn't look like a car's "finish". The metallic teal is also a bit duller/darker
than on most other toys of AoE Drift, which means it doesn't stick out/contrast
as much. Again, it still looks good, just not AS good. The transparent
dark blue used for the windows is a nice shade of the color-- it's dark
enough where most of the robot bits inside can't be seen (again, excepting
the swords). If you're going to make the windows transparent without the
room for a detailed interior, this is the way to go. There's also silver
headlights and taillights (surprisingly on the latter, given how much those
get overlooked), silver wheel rims, and the Bugatti Veyron-signature grill,
all looking quite good and contrasting with the other colors nicely. The
black does blend in with the dark blue a bit if Drift isn't under strong
light, but it's not used all that much beyond the back end and is a minor
quibble. The only detailing I wish was painted is the rather intricate
detailing on the engine/venting behind the rear window; this is left dark
blue, sadly. A shame, given how little mold detailing is otherwise on the
Drift toy in this mode (though this is accurate to how sleek the Bugatti
Veyron looks, of course).

    For the most part, Drift's
transformation is fairly straightforward-- as with many movie car TFs,
the hood parts fold back and compress a bit, while the arms and legs merely
fold out from the car mode. There's a few extra surprise bits for this
deluxe version, though, with the car doors folding up on the upper arms
to look like the teal-armored bits Drift has up there on the movie model;
the car bits on the sides of the lower legs angle back some and lock in
at a slightly diagonal angle to increase the visual interest there and
more obviously breakup the actual leg from the vehicle kibble; and the
car hood and front bumper on the back actually rotate around and peg in
securely behind Drift's upper back. Despite this, I will say that the roof
behind Drift's back is my chief issue with the toy-- it doesn't get in
the way of articulation, but it does stick out a bit from Drift's otherwise
somewhat slim (for a male TF) main body and chest. The front bumper behind
his butt looks particularly bad. As far as the core robot proportions go,
Drift's robot arms are a bit skinny, but other than that he looks pretty
solid. He's got nice, fairly bulky legs that are molded to look like they
have that armor plating on the upper portion, the partially fake chest
is actually pretty convincing (the grill carries over from the vehicle
mode, but nothing else), and his relatively large feet make him nice and
stable. The mold detailing for this mode is also great, with all sorts
of little bits and bobs on the robot mode parts-- beyond just the aforementioned
plating, a careful look can pick out springs, hinges, and even fake folded-up
car bits on the abdomen and arms. The headsculpt is also spot-on, fitting
Drift's obviously samurai-inspired headsculpt perfectly-- and he's actually
got the movie-accurate gold paint on his face this time, as opposed to
the inaccurate silver paint on most of his other AoE toys! Yee-haw! He's
also got a fairly cheery expression, reflecting the "calm, at peace" attitude
he tries to put forth during most of the movie. As far as the colors go,
the increased amount of teal helps make this mode look more visually interesting,
as does the gold head and the brownish-gold plastic used for his swords.
In a VERY neat extra touch, all four of his swords can store behind his
back in "fan"-like manner, just like on his movie model-- not only does
this look nice, it calls to mind his other alt mode not replicated here--
his helicopter mode, what with the "fan blades" and all. To look their
best, the two shorter blades store further behind his back in this mode,
the longer two blades in front of them, right behind Drift's back proper.
(In car mode, the longer swords store on the underside, while the shorter
blades store where the longer blades do in this mode.) Of course, Drift
can hold any two of these swords in his hands. For articulation, Drift
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
hips (at three points), knees, and forward a bit at the ankles. There's
no reason other than budgetary reasons he's missing a waist joint, so I
kinda lament the inability of him to move there, but otherwise he's got
great poseability.

    AoE deluxe Drift is
a quite nice adaptation of his movie model. The Bugatti Veyron mode looks
absolutely stellar, and his robot mode has a great, unique look to it with
some excellent weapon placement, some nice molded/painted details with
the teal armor, and pretty good proportions (skinny arms aside). He does
have a few moderate kibble issues, like the roof/bumper behind his robot
back and the bits on the sides of his lower legs, but overall he's a worthy
and recommended addition to any movie collector's repertoire.
