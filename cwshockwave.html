    Shockwave's alternate
mode is a flying gun, although it's a bit less "gun-ish" than his G1 form,
looking a bit more like some spacecraft, although not as obviously like
one as his
    <a href="focshockwave.html">
     FoC form
    </a>
    . There IS a flip-out
handle on the rear underside of this mode that you can that other, larger
Transformers can use to hold him him. (The box says he's paired with
    <a href="cwonslaught.html">
     Bruticus
    </a>
    ,
but by no means can he only connect to that mold.) There is an odd, rectangular
second handle in front of the "actual" handle that can hinder posing--
I'm not sure why that was included, as it just looks weird and only subtracts
from the mode. Like most Shockwave toys, he's got a long barrel in this
mode, with the mouth of the barrel looking a bit like Shockwave's iconic
head. His two robot knees are quite obvious inside the mouth of the barrel,
though, which is a negative-- I would've preferred one obvious area where
the make-believe "blasts" would theoretically have come from. Shockwave's
robot feet are also pretty darned obvious on the sides of the long nose
of this mode. I suppose one could say they're little "wings", but I can't
see anything but feet, there. Otherwise, design-wise this mode is great,
with relatively slim proportions, the other robot extras hidden away fairly
well, and a nice targeting reticle on top of the mode. The mold detailing
is fairly good, with panels and ridges everywhere they need to be, along
with molded-in "thrusters" on the back end. From a back end view, Shockwave's
hands are a little obvious, but this is a minor issue at worst. This mode's
weakest point is with the color scheme-- he's got your regular Shockwave
purple (though a bit darker and duller than usual this time), and a bit
of nice transparent pinkish purple used for the barrel mouth. However,
there's some of that really bland light milky gray color used for his robot
feet, targeting reticle, and a few other minor pieces-- the reticle in
particular really could've used some paint apps, but as a whole the color
scheme for this mode is pretty dull and nearly all dark, dull purple. It
doesn't catch the eye nearly as well as it should.

    Shockwave's transformation
mostly consists of just pulling apart and folding down his arms and legs,
and then pulling back on the center section to have his head fold up while
said center section goes onto his back. It's a very small bit of gun mode
stuff on his back, and it doesn't get in the way of his overall silhouette
or articulation at all, so it's a very minor negative at most. There are
obvious half-panels of the rear portion of his gun/vehicle mode on the
sides of his hands, which are mostly just molded onto the bottom side of
those panels. Otherwise, this mode is pretty extra-free-- I particularly
love how the barrel splits apart and the hips move up to make for pretty
much flawless, proportional legs (though from a back view, they are hollow).
His chest hearkens back to his G1 form, with a lot of excellent mold detailing,
such as the abs and chest that look like a more detailed version of his
G1 hexagonal chest. His headsculpt is spot-on, and pretty much exactly
his traditional headsculpt, with the head narrowing perhaps a tiny bit
more than usual but still very much within his "usual" head design parameters.
The yellow eye in the midst of the black looks as intimidating and emotionless
as ever. Shockwave's color scheme is thankfully more broken up in this
mode, though it's still a bit two-tone-- there's more light milky gray
breaking up all the purple, and he does have more transparent pinkish purple
visible on his chest and hand and gun-hand, but there's still a bit too
much dark dull purple on him-- I wish he had a few more paint apps like
the silver on his abs. For articulation, Shockwave can move at the neck,
shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), hips (at three points),
knees, and a bit forward-and-back at the ankles. Given that he's also well-balanced,
this means he can pull off a lot of dynamic poses.

    The Combiner Wars version
of Shockwave is a nice "middle" between his very gun-like G1 form and his
more spacecraft-like FoC form. He's a great accessory for the CW gestalts,
and has an extremely well-designed, articulated, and proportioned robot
mode. His vehicle/gun mode is a bit weaker, with obvious feet and not enough
paint apps, but he's still a great mold and highly recommended if you want
a Shockwave that's small enough to actually be wielded by most other TFs.
