    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Knock Out toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
Knock Out w/ Energon Driller set

     This redeco of Knock
Out, oddly enough, doesn't have any sort of themed title before the name,
like "Firewatch Knock Out" or somesuch, which can make it a bit harder
to identify. "Prime Cyberverse Knock Out? Which one?" Anyways, this redeco
keeps Knock Out's colors within the same general space on the color wheel,
but brightens it up a bit, with a rather nice-looking shade of orange being
the dominant plastic color. Black serves as the main darker color-- on
the windows, wheels, and main robot body-- and contrasts excellently against
the orange, giving Knock Out a bit of a Halloween-y feel to him. His paint
apps in vehicle mode, thankfully, are a bit more exciting this time around,
with a dull purplish red both complementing the orange and contrasting
against it because of how dark it is. The fire-like detailing on the sides
is pretty much identical to Knock Out's paint job over his traditional
color scheme on the show, but different in color this time around, and
looks pretty nifty. There isn't any paint on the back end of Knock Out's
vehicle mode, unfortunately-- it's all orange back there, including the
back window-- but between the other black windows and the red paint on
the vehicle mode, he looks pretty diverse color-wise on the rest of the
toy. In robot mode his colors are broken up a bit more, specifically by
some good application of silver and gunmetal gray plastic that also contrasts
well against his other colors. His eyes are also painted an appropriate
shade of light red, with the dull red from vehicle mode carrying over nicely
to his feet and head "helmet".

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Knock Out, though the Cyberverse weapon he
comes with has been changed-- it's the same knife/blade weapon that's come
with many of the 2012 legion Prime Autobots, but this time colored in the
usual Decepticon light purple. It's a fitting weapon for Knock Out the
surgeon, and the purple contrasts decently enough from his orange color
scheme.

     The solo-packed legion
Knock Out toy is largely an excellently done redeco, with the back area
of the vehicle mode being the only area that's really in need of more paint.
With orange, black, and dull red his main colors, this Knock Out is different
enough for fans of the first version that came with the Energon Driller
to get if you're into same-character redecos, but the colors aren't
     <i>
      completely
     </i>
     different and thus can serve as a "close enough" stand-in for Cyberverse
Knock Out if you don't have any desire to get the more expensive Driller
set. Out of the two different color schemes this Knock Out toy's been released
in, I'd recommend this version the most.

       Once his weapons are thoroughly tested
and proven safe, Knock Out keeps the best ones for himself. He boosts their
power output, adds a few personal touches, and then takes them out into
the field to see what sort of damage he can do.
