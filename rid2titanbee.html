    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is pretty show-accurate in terms of its proportions-- it's accurately got
the angular look of this design, and there's PRETTY much no robot extras
in this mode-- if you look at him from the back end you can see the top
of his head, but in any other angle it's hidden by the rear portion of
the vehicle, so that's a pretty minor issue. As with most RID2015 toys,
the mold detailing is fairly sparse, but all the necessary mold details
ARE here-- the three diagonal stripes on the hood, the divots near the
back end, the windows, the angular headlights and front grill. Unfortunately,
this being a Titan Changer, you've got the front windows and the front
    <i>
     half
    </i>
    of the side windows painted metallic black, but that's it as far as paint
apps go. The tires are black, too, of course, but otherwise this mode is
alllllll yellow. And those are pretty massive unbroken portions of yellow,
let me tell ya. What is odd is that the pieces used for the front grill
and the top half of middle third of the vehicle mode is a slightly more
brighter yellow than the more golden yellow plastic used for the rest of
him. They're pretty close, though, so only upon close inspection is this
apparent. Both shades of yellow have a semi-metallic glittery swirl in
them, which looks pretty nice.

    To transform 'Bee to
robot mode, you just unfold the front halves of the mode out to form Bumblebee's
feet and then push out the sides to become his arms. The end result actually
looks okay from the waist up, in terms of the mold. The lower arms are
a bit too short, but otherwise they're pretty accurate, with some excellently-done
sculpting on the chest in particular. His headsculpt is also nicely done,
with a bit of a smirk and blue eyes. The silver paint used for his face
is a bit dark, though. The shoulders attach to the body directly so they
can be at a bit of an odd angle, but otherwise they're pretty accurate.
Given that this is a Titan Changer, he's pretty paint-free; beyond the
face, only the metallic black on the faux window on the chest and on the
waist are present. As with most Titan Changers, Bumblebee's legs are ridiculously
long, particularly the lower legs (this is done so it looks like you're
getting more for your money in the box, I suppose). The roof bits make
for okay feet, but otherwise those are just pretty weak lower legs. For
articulation, Bumblebee can move at the shoulders on ball joints, and due
to his transformation he can move each leg backwards at the knee, though
it doesn't lock in place unless it's straight downwards as shown above.
I know it's a Titan Changer so it's pretty bare-bones, but elbow articulation
would've been nice.

    Titan Changer Bumblebee's
core design actually isn't bad, with very little kibble and a solid car
mode. The robot mode's lower arms are a bit short and-- like pretty much
all Titan Changers-- the legs are way too long, but otherwise it looks
okay. The issue here comes with the almost complete lack of paint and basically
just shoulder articulation. You can do worse for the money, but unless
you want a big 'Bee toy for real cheap this is probably an easy pass.
