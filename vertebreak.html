    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Prime Lazerback. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Prime Lazerback

     Vertebreak's deco job
certainly invokes much more of an "animalistic" feel than Lazerback's.
Vertebreak's main colors of yellow, orange (both of a pale and a more normal
shade), and dark brown very much make him feel like he'd feel comfortable
on the savannah-- little wonder his weapon is called the "Hyena Cannon".
The two shades of orange complement each other quite well while still each
looking distinct enough, and they both contrast against and complement
the yellow as well. (If you've been reading my reviews for a while, you
know I'm not a big fan of the color yellow, but it works well here given
his whole "theme".) The dark brown also works as a darker color against
Vertebreak's otherwise light color scheme. What really makes Vertebreak
stand out among a shelf-- even a shelf of Predacons-- are all his "tiger
stripes". The brown stripes on his legs, as well as the yellow stripes
on his face and back, are both excellently done and really help keep one
color from being too dominant in any one section. They also just give him
a ton of uniqueness, which is always good for a redeco. He's also got a
bit of silver paint-- namely on his snout, tail, chest, and robot face,
but where it really looks good is on his feet, where there's a nice "spray"
on each foot centering around his claws that catches the light just right
where you're not sure initially if it's actual paint there or the light
reflection. The one color choice on Vertebreak I'm not fond of is that
the sides of his main body and his robot head are yellow plastic mixed
with a bright "safety" orange. Normally I like the "mixed" plastics prevalent
in Beast Hunters, but here the safety orange is just too bright and doesn't
complement the yellow well-- it just looks like partially scratched-off
paint apps. A straight yellow for those parts would have worked better.

     Vertebreak has an awesome
name, but more importantly a supremely unique tiger-striped color scheme
with an overall "theme" to his deco that would make him fit in the African
savannah. All of the tiger stripe paint apps-- and a few other unique touches
like his purple eyes in both modes-- make this a mild recommendation if
you like the more "out there" aspects of Beast Hunters. Overall, though,
I'd recommend him just SLIGHTLY below Lazerback, due to the ugly yellow/bright
orange mixed plastic, plus I just generally think red works on this mold
a bit better than yellow.

        Vertebreak can't sense much from the
murky interior of the Hyperevolution Chamber in which he waits, half-awake,
to be reborn. But he knows that he is being moved. The steady flow of information
into his mind from the data connections installed by Shockwave ceases first,
and then there is a sensation of lightness as the chamber is lifted. He
cares little for any of this. All he wants is to be free of the little
chamber-- to be free to hint, to fight, and to destroy. He longs to feel
the rush of battle. Luckily, he doesn't have long to wait. After a short
time in darkness, the chamber opens and Vertebreak smells the familiar
air of Cybertron.
