    Mold History

   : Ruination's mold dates
all the way back to 1986, when the mold was released as the Combaticon
Gestalt Bruticus, as part of the original Transformers line.

    Ruination is a combination
of the Decepticon Commandos- i.e.,
    <a href="rotor.html">
     Ro-Tor
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="movor.html">
     Movor
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="rollbar.html">
     Rollbar
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="armorhide.html">
     Armorhide
    </a>
    ,
and their leader,
    <a href="megaoctane.html">
     Mega-Octane
    </a>
    . For an old
mold, Ruination looks very good in this mode, albeit very obviously a gestalt.
With the exception of the Mega-Octane and Rollbar parts, which match perfectly,
the color schemes of the individual components don't really go together
that well, albeit they don't really clash. Looking rather menacing, though,
is pretty much all Ruination's good for. His only articulation at all is
in his arms at the shoulders, and they don't even move that well anyway.
They're held to the main body by skinny little pegs, and they can very
easily come out. Not to mention that when you do turn the arm, the shoulders
on the main body also turn with them if you're not careful, which in turn
knocks the chest plate right off. Very annoying indeed. For a figure this
big- and costing $30 dollars at that- no leg articulation is simply unacceptable.
Also, Ruination's combination is rather corny- after you combine the five
Commandos, you have to slap on sepearate hand, feet, chestplate, and head
parts, which aren't storable on any of the Commandos seperately. And, as
you probably know by now, I HATE storing Transformer's parts in seperate
containers. Also, Ruination can not even hold all of his component's guns-
even combining as many weapons as you can, he still can't hold any of Movor's
guns, Ro-Tor's chain guns, or Mega-Octane's shield-ramp. Which means, yipee,
more unstorable parts.

    Although Ruination may
look rather menacing and evil, that's about as far as he goes. Like the
individual Commandos, Ruination simply does not measure up to the expectations
of a modern toy, especially not a $30 one. Unless you have some kind of
thing for old toys, or are a completist, I'd pass this one up.
