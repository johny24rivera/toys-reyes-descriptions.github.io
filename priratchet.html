    Ratchet's vehicle mode
is an ambulance, and-- when it comes to the design, at least-- it's very
accurate to the show in its proportions. All the windows and various panels
are molded in where they're needed, such as the back door, the front grill,
the detailing on his wheel hubs, and the like. However, a few areas that
are supposed to be relatively sparse in mold detailing-- like the back
halves on each side-- instead look rather crowded because of all the panel
lines due to his transformation. Normally there's only a few major "lines"
among the alt modes of Transformers that aren't hidden in where you would
expect "seams" to be, but Ratchet here has several of them, and looks the
worse for it. His color scheme is mostly white and orangish-red, just like
on the show, and the colors contrast against each other exceedingly well,
as well as simply being fitting for the alt mode and character. The bits
of black, silver, and transparent blue serve as decent enough accent colors
where they are. However-- and this is by far my biggest issue with Ratchet
in this mode-- he is missing a TON of paint detailing, to the point where
an otherwise accurate alt mode ends up being... not-accurate. Most of his
rear section is supposed to be orange-red, not white! And yet, beyond a
couple of lines on the side (including lines surrounding what should be
one of his side windows, but it's not painted blue and isn't transparent
blue plastic, so it looks weird), his back half is almost entirely bereft
of paint detailing. Except for silver on the bumper, his backside isn't
painted at all-- all those nice details like his taillights, completely
unpainted! Hasbro really should've used a different plastic color mix or
designed the sprues differently or something, because a toy that isn't
a redeco that is this inaccurate to the show is rather unacceptable. On
the plus side, othern than the tiniest bit of his feet sticking below the
bottom rims behind the front tires, Ratchet has no robot mode extras to
speak of in this mode (you can see some bits inside his windows, but they're
not identifiable as anything). His weapons are a pair of knives which can
fit into ports on either his front bumper or on his roof in this mode,
though plugged into his roof they look really goofy. Plugged into his front
bumper, they still look goofy, but less so. I wish there had been a less
obvious way to store these otherwise nicely-detailed weapons in this mode...

    Ratchet's transformation
mostly isn't what you'd expect given his robot design-- it mostly involves
simply unfolding his arms and legs from the sides of the vehicle mode and
then sliding back his back panel, which causes his head to pop up with
a rather nice spring-loaded action. His entire chest has faux vehicle mode
detailing on it, with the real windows and side doors on the backside of
his legs. This latter point is my primary issue with this mode, as they're
clearly just pieces of show-inaccurate kibble hanging off his back legs,
and don't fit with the overall shape of their surrounding pieces much (though
they do admittedly add a bit of "mass" to his lower legs that would otherwise
be lacking). There's also an extra bit of "bulk" around the waist that
shouldn't be there, though this is a much more minor issue. The only other
real vehicle mode extra in this mode is the square back panel, and that's
there on the show and it doesn't get in the way of articulation, so I don't
mind it. Ratchet's proportions in this mode are show-accurate for the most
part, except for the arms; his shoulders are a bit too small proportionally,
and his upper arms too skinny (though not annoyingly so). His colors are
also off a bit in this mode, with too much white again, though at least
the balance is a bit more even this time around. He's got plenty of red-orange
and silver paint apps across his chassis to break up all that white, and
all the mold and paint detailing done for the faux windows and grill on
his chest and abs is really well done, "fake" or not. Ratchet's head design
is spot-on to the show, both in terms of the mold and paint detailing,
and also just looks super spiffy, with very well-done blue light piping
on the eyes. Ratchet can-- as you'd expect-- hold his two blade weapons
in his hands in this mode. But, in a stroke of genius, his hands can also
rotate back into his lower arms a bit so that the knives point forward,
mimicking how Ratchet deploys those blades in place of his fists in the
show. For articulation, Ratchet can move at the neck, shoulders (at four
points), elbows, wrists, rotation at the waist, and movement at the hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), ankles, and slightly in-and-outwards
at the toes. Given that he's well balanced, this means that you can get
some pretty good poses out of him-- moreso than most other Prime RiD deluxes.

    Prime deluxe Ratchet
does an excellent job of replicating his vehicle mode and a decent job
of his robot mode, though a few minor proportional and kibble issues do
hinder the latter some. He's also got some neat weapons and good articulation.
However, his lack of a decent amount of red-orange paint where there should
be plenty of it really makes him look off from his show model when it needn't
be so, particularly in vehicle mode. The amount of "faux bits" in his robot
mode and unsightly panel lines in ambulance mode also bother me, albeit
to a lesser extent. Still, if you're a fan of the character and want a
"normal"-sized version of him, you don't really have any other options--
Ratchet didn't get a higher-budgeted "First Edition" version like the rest
of the core Autobot team in Prime.

      Just because Autobot Ratchet chooses
to avoid fighting doesn't mean he never learned how. His intimate knowledge
of anatomy allows him to strike with surgical precision, making a fight
against him a very painful losing proposition.
