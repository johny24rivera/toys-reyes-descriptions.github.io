not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
Grimlock toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     "Gold Armor" Grimlock
is essentially the RID design in G1 colors. Unfortunately, the vast majority
of his plastic is that awful, boring light milky gray plastic that I just
really do not like and really should've been made more metallic. In beast
mode, he's got plain yellow paint around the section that would be metallic
gold on the G1 Grimlock toy, but other than that and the red eyes, there's
no paint in this mode at all. Just all that blah light milky gray plastic.
No paint on the head crest, nothing on the back legs or feet, nothing on
the tail. Nada. In robot mode he sports a few more colors-- beyond the
yellow on the chest and the bits on the sides of the head, he's also got
some red on the waist and some glossy black on the upper legs and head,
with silver on the face and red eyes. Unfortunately his entire arms and
lower legs are still that milky gray. The thing is... with that particular
color combo of red, black, and yellow, and the way it's arranged, and with
the slight "ear" antennae, Gold Armor Grimlock, he..... he kinda looks
like Mickey Mouse. *snirk* Once I saw that, I could not unsee it.

     Mickey Mou-- I mean,
Gold Armor Grimlock is pretty much a waste of plastic. I don't say that
lightly, but sometimes G1 isn't the way to go. You take a fairly bad 1-step
mold like this and kinda half-way it with some very basic G1 colors in
robot mode and only some yellow in beast mode, you make waaay too much
of it in that bland light gray plastic, with the t-rex mode in particular
just barren... I just can't recommend it except for the biggest Grimlock
completists. Get the

     of you want this design in G1 colors.
