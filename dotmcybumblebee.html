    Bumblebee's new tiny
toy models his modified Camaro alt mode quite well, being pretty proportional
in all respects while having the additional spoiler and modified bumper
added to this toy. He's also entirely robot mode extra-free in this mode;
even the robot feet that were at the back end of his previous Legion-class
movieverse toys fold down on this toy so that there's exhaust pipes and
part of the rear bumper molded in there. Bumblebee's color scheme is the
usual dull yellow and black, here; nothing we haven't seen tons of times
before, so you probably already know my thoughts on it (i.e., I'm not a
huge fan, but it's not ugly)-- that said, the shade of swirly, glittery
dull yellow makes the color scheme look about as good here as it's going
to get. As far as paint apps go, all of his necessary details-- such as
the stripes, windows, and front bumper-- are all painted appropriately
(the paint used for the windows is a particularly good shade). That said,
the rear bumper could've used a paint app or two.

    Bumblebee's transformation
to robot mode is pretty much the same as on his other small movieverse
toys, but there's an important difference here-- he has KNEES. Oh, glorious
knees-- certainly something much appreciated on a toy this small. They
also make his robot mode look more proportional. (That said, his arms are
still rather skinny, simply being molded on the inside of his car door
pieces-- though the wheels being on the shoulders this time helps to "buff
them up" a tad.) He has a bit of his car hood hanging behind his main body,
but it's no huge unsightly deal and doesn't get in the way of movement
one bit. The mold detailing is quite good and rather crisp in this mode,
with the headsculpt in particular looking the best and most accurate it
ever has at this scale. One arm is molded in its cannon form, whereas the
other has a thumb sticking out so that he can hold Cyberverse weapons or
grasp Cyberverse-scaled handles. As far as total articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips, knees, and ankles-- top-notch
for a figure of this size.

    Bumblebee is a great
DotM Legion toy-- one of the best of the line, in fact, and improved over
either of his previous movieverse toys in this category. If you're looking
for a small, accurate movieverse Bumblebee toy, this is the one to get,
no question.

      Bumblebee balances his strict sense
of duty with a lighthearted sense of humor. The other Autobots know they
can rely on him in even the most dangerous situations, both to watch their
backs, and lighten the tension with a well-timed joke.
