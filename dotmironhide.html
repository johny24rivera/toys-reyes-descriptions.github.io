    Ironhide is a GMC Topkick
truck; you're likely familiar with this general vehicle design by now,
so my comments on that generally still stand with this toy, as the proportions
are nearly exactly the same as on the

    Ironhide toy. (It is a bit smaller, though, because of
the increased cost of making toys and all that.) The robot mode extras
are pretty miminal; the front of the lower legs stick out a BIT from the
bottom, but this isn't really noticeable unless you look at the toy from
a straight-on side view. The truck bed in the back also has some odd details
to it because it forms the bottom of the feet, though it's not immediately
apparent that they do so. Any robot mode extras inside the windows are
hid by how dark they are, so no complaints there, either. As you'd expect,
Ironhide is really one-tone in this mode, with almost of his coloration
being black. That said, there are a fair number of paint applications on
him-- namely on the front and rear bumpers, with the exhaust pipes molded
in that blah light milky gray plastic. I do wish the rear windows were
at least painted a deep blue that mostly matches the transparent plastic,
though, as having blue front windows and black back windows just makes
it look a little unfinished. Ironhide's Mechtech weapon is one of the best
in the line; it doesn't really "transform" like most of the others, but
as you push in on the claw-like back end (which you can certainly turn
around if you want Ironhide to have a claw weapon), then the front part
spins forward, and keeps spinning for a couple seconds-- it's simple, but
a fun, addictive little gimmick. I also love how there's some orange "powered-up"
paint apps in the middle of the Mechtech gun that turn gray as you activate
the weapon and "its energy is expended". Ironhide has three ports for Mechtech
weapons-- one on his roof and one behind each of his side doors-- and the
weapon itself has another Mechtech port on top of it.

    Ironhide's robot mode
largely does a good job of imitating his on-screen model, but there are
a few big problems I feel the need to point out. First, his legs are ridiculously
tiny and short proportionally and move awkwardly; they can mostly only
move up-and-down at the shoulders, which are almost right next to the elbows
(?!), while his lower arm is the only part that moves like you think an
arm on a mainline figure could. Like on many Movie Ironhide figures, to
get the rather cool angled front/wheels look on his chest, his head is
positioned a bit too far back, and that whole assembly feels a little unstable,
not tabbing or pegging into anything TOO securely (there is one peg, but
it doesn't do the job well enough.) Additionally, the door wings fanning
out behind him and the small bumper pieces on his lower arms are definitely
just pieces of kibble and don't look like his onscreen model. On the positive
side, Ironhide has several different colors on him that make their appearance
in this mode, despite most of them being variations of gray and blue. It
certainly helps to break up all the black from his vehicle mode, and generally
looks good, though not exceptional. His legs are also very well-propotioned
and have nice wide, long, stable feet, and the mold detailing on his robot
parts is very well-done, quite accurately depicting how he looks in the
movies-- his head sculpt, in particular. It's a bummer that he only has
his one Mechtech weapon-- though he can store it attached to one of his
lower arms like in the movie, he doesn't have two cannons to make him more
movie-accurate. Considering that this is IRONHIDE, of all 'bots, he should
be packing a bit more firepower. As for articulation, Ironhide can move
at the neck, shoulders (at two points, nearly hidden inside his body),
elbows (at two points), wrist swivels, and he can also move at the hips
(at three points), knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points, with
one of those being a ball joint). As I said earlier, his arm articulation
can look pretty odd, but otherwise you can get him in some mighty cool,
stable poses.

    DotM voyager Ironhide
is a nice second attempt at the design, and it does result in modes that
are a little less kibble-laden than his first Voyager mold, with a bit
more color variety and a slightly simpler transformation. That said, his
head is still way too far back, and his arms in robot mode are just plain
awful, knocking him a bit below the original mold in my opinion. The door
"wings" on transparent ball joints also makes me a little nervous that
they'll break eventually, too. It's still a decent toy, but only recommended
if you can't find the older versions of the mold at a decent price or think
the original's transformation too much of a pain.

      Ironhide saved the best of the Mechtech
weapons for himself. He spent weeks tuning and tweaking the weapon he'd
built, turning it into a compact and devastating armanent. Now, with his
work finally done, he just needs a Decepticon target to test it out on.
