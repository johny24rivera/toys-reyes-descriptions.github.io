    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Strongarm. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Strongarm

     Fallback is meant to be the
new upgraded version of G1 Outback-- a relatively obscure character from
the original series-- and I always love obscure homages. (Enough Starscreams,
I want a new Squeezeplay, heh.) Fallback's color scheme is very good, easily
the most realistic of the three schemes this mold has had so far. The tan,
brown, and black go PERFECTLY together for such a rough-n-tough Transformer--
I can't imagine any scheme looking better on this toy, honestly. He's also
got some nice silver and gray in all the right places, and some really
nice blue paint apps to add some originality to the color scheme. The transparent
aquamarine used for his Energon chip and axe is also a really eye-catching
color, too. The only paint app on him that I DON'T like is that his face
is dipped in silver paint-- it loks a little overly hokey to me, and the
silver paint tends to rub off in little glittery specks on the top edges
of the head. (Also, in case you're wondering which head Fallback has, it's
the slightly-altered
     <a href="strongarm2.html">

     mold.)
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Fallback has no mold
changes from his previous versions, but the shoulder-wheel pivots seem
a bit loose on this toy, whereas they stayed in place on both iterations
of Strongarm. The rotating piece on the shoulder that attaches the Energon
gun onto the vehicle mode also is more loose than on previous versions.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Fallback is an awesome
repaint of an already great toy, and it's the perfect homage to G1 Outback.
All of the color choices just go together so nicely-- I can't see the mold
looking any better than this. One of the gems of the Botcon 2005 exclusives.

       Fallback was once the independent-minded
Autobot known as Outback. Having once believed he would be nothing but
a casualty of war, he was proven wrong when, even after almost being destroyed,
he survived and was granted a new exo-form. Having been given a second
chance at life, Fallback decided to take on a new name and a new purpose:
to follow in the footsteps of great Autobots such as Ultra Magnus and Rodimus
Prime and become the best Autobot warrior he can be. Though still not a
big fan of rules, Fallback has learned to respect them and utilize them
to his advantage.

       Abilities: Fallback's body is composed
of armor designed to resist most forms of artillery fire. His primary weapon
is an axe forged from solid Energon. This can also double as an energy
cannon. In vehicle mode, he can go up to 180 mph with a range of 1,000
miles. His tires are reinforced, allowing them to travel on the roughest
of terrain without damage.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Weakness: Fallback still sometimes reverts
to his old way of thinking, and thus falls into situations where he is
outnumbered.
