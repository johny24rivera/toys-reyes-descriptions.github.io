    Optimus' vehicle mode
is very well-represented on his Robovision form-- one would argue even
moreso than the "normal" mass-release version of
    <a href="movvoyprime.html">
     Voyager
Optimus Prime
    </a>
    . This is because of the very nice silver paint on nearly
all of Prime's gray parts, which makes it look more metallic and "robot-like"
and less like gray toy plastic. Prime's paint job in this mode is great
even ignoring the silver, with quite a few blue and red flame paint apps,
just like in the movie (I'm puzzled why the red flames are slightly duller
than the actual red used for the plastic parts, though.) There proportions
are spot-on accurate when compared with the movie truck mode, which is
quite impressive at this scale given the complexity of the design. There's
no robot mode extras whatsoever, though there's no real "back" to the main
body of the truck, just the backside of his various leg parts-- luckily,
it's not obvious they're robot parts, and they blend in reasonably well
with the overall shape of that area of the truck. The mold detailing is
also exquisite, with bolts, headlights, metal plates, and wires molded
in pretty much EVERYWHERE it's even vaguely appropriate-- and it all gets
even more impressive in robot mode. Robovision Prime's even worked in transparent
headlights and windows, as well as a really neat gimmick that's undocumented
in the instructions. You can open and close his left door-- when it's closed,
a cowboy driver is in the seat, but when you open up the door, the driver
disappears! A REALLY nice and unexpected touch, there.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is equally impressive-- in fact, I actually think it's a bit better
than the larger,
    <a href="movleaderprime.html">
     Leader-sized Movie Prime
    </a>
    toy, as it has more movie-accurate proportions and less vehicle kibble.
All of Prime's kibble is stored in the front part of the truck hanging
off his back, which doesn't make him too backheavy or interfere with articulation,
so it's a very small negative if that. The "truck chest" is fake, though,
with metallic silvery blue windows instead of transparent windows-- but
having a less-accurate movie transformation is less important to me than
having more-accurate movie proportions, in my opinion. As said before,
his mold and paint detailing is utterly fantastic, especially on the head,
upper arms, and legs. Prime also has great articulation-- he can move at
any major point you can reasonably expect on a Voyager-sized toy except
the waist, so you can get a ton of cool poses out of him. Plus, he comes
with two really neat smokestack-rifles, which can each fire a spring-loaded
missile. The rifles can be stored on his backpack when not in use, too.
More cool things to add to Robovision Prime's impressive list of features
are that the light piping in his optics works quite well, and his automorph
feature-- which involves his entire lower legs pretty much transforming
by themselves-- is quite impressive as well.

    Overall, Robovision
Optimus Prime is the best iteration (that I've seen so far) of one of the
best movie toyline molds, which is saying a LOT. With practically no flaws,
this is a toy that even the most casual Transformers fan should pick up--
it's truly a masterpiece of engineering and detailing.

      Blazing down to Earth's surface from
outer space comes Optimus Prime. His protoform is ideal for covering the
vast distances between stars and armored to survive the catastrophic descent
through a planetary atmosphere. When he arrives, however, his first task
is to find an appropriate disguise in which to conduct his search for the
Allspark. As his scanning beam sweeps over nearby objects, he sees the
world in the deep red that tells him his targeting and scanning systems
are active. Then, his gaze settles upon the coolest thing he has ever seen.
Yes, this will be his disguise on Earth.
