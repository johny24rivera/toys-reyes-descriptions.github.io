    Vehicle mode is a police
car. This mode looks pretty nice, overall. The style is very sleek and
modernized, and the tires are good, quality rubber, with "TRANSFORMERS
2000" inscribed on them. The "jet boosters" on the back of the police car
look pretty neat, although they can be removed if you want a "normal" police
car mode or attached to the rear fenders if you think that looks better.
They can't be stored out-of-view, though, which is a slight letdown. The
Japanese lettering on the side of the car doors I would have taken out,
however, since it seems rather out of place on an American toy. The windows
are tinted to move attention away from the robot parts inside the "glass",
but they aren't tinted quite enough, and it's still fairly obvious that
there's robot parts inside Prowl's outer vehicle shell instead of car seats.
Although his headlights, exhaust pipes, and taillights are nicely detailed,
Prowl's color scheme is, overall, rather "blah" in this mode, pretty much
just being tinted plastic, black, and white. A bit more variation in color
in this mode would have been appreciated. One thing I've noticed about
this mode that few others seem to notice is that, from a head-on side view,
Prowl's vehicle mode looks oddly... curved. Like it had a slight collision
with another car, and the front fourth is bunched up slightly. Maybe it's
just me, though...

    Prowl's robot mode is
just plain spiffy. It's also the most symmetrical-looking of the Car Brothers
(Prowl,
    <a href="sideburn.html">
     Side Burn
    </a>
    , and
    <a href="xbrawn.html">
     X-Brawn
    </a>
    ).
The nice bluish silver detailing on the inside of the shoulder pads looks
neat, as does the blue and red "swirly patterns" on the circle parts over
the wheels there. The use of the car doors as a "samurai skirt" is very
neat as well, and definitely adds character. Those parts can break rather
easily, though, since they're long, flat, and wide, so be careful. His
"jet boosters" from his vehicle mode can be fitted atop his right hand
to become flame throwers in this mode (push the flame-missiles out and
they "fire"), or they can be slid on his police headlights on his back
to become a jet pack for this mode. Awesome! The transmetal red Autobot
symbol on Prowl's chest looks pretty cool, too. Prowl's robot head actually
seems to resemble his vehicle mode a little, as it's sloped, and the black
is on the bottom while the white is on the top. The color scheme is also
a bit more varied in this mode, taking away from the "blah" look of the
vehicle mode's paint job. One thing I don't like about this mode, however,
is the fact that Prowl's legs and feet are too small. It's hard to get
him to stand up straight in this mode without leaning him forward a little,
and even then, he can fall over at the slightest reverberation. Prowl's
"back" is also rather poorly constructed as well- his car hood can't fold
up in a position to make it look solid, so it looks like his back is "sticking
out" about a inch farther than it should be. Also, Prowl's "shield" mounted
on his left arm is rather cumbersome, and it can't be removed. His arms
also have very limited movement because of the car door-skirt right below
them, so it's hard to give Prowl a battle stance in this mode without making
him look like he's shrugging.

    A pretty good toy, although
not without its flaws. The most symmetrical-looking of the Car Brothers,
however, and the robot mode is nice, at least visually. The color scheme
in vehicle mode leaves a little something to be desired, however.

        Prowl's vehicle mode
is a Police car that is modeled after the Lamborghini Contach. Being a
fan of Lambo's, I reall like this mode. Proportions are spot on, and he
is almost up to the movie toy standards. The Jet boosters are nice, but
I usually leave them off. Now the one thing I disagree with 100% with Beastbot
on in this mode, is the Japanese writing. I think it suits the mold, and
I like it a lot. It adds diversity and makes it, well, a bit more authentic
in my mind, even if it is an American toy. Other than that, it has nice
chrome silver rims and rubber tires, sometihing I like quite a bit. It
might just be me, but I think the feet in the car look like car seats...

        Prowl's robot mode is
pretty nice. Mold wise it looks really cool, mainly the doors on his shins
and the shoulders. I really like the autubot symbol on his chest formed
from the exaust pipes and bottom of the back of the car. Proportions are
okay, his legs area a bit small, and can cause him to fall over a bit easier
than I would like. My main problem with this mode is the blue. It looks
like he is wearing a pair of jeans, honestly. It needs to be spread on
his arms or something, it just looks awkward the way it is right now.

        Prowl is a nice figure,
and he has many strong points, but if you are looking for a version of
this mold, I would look for his redeco instead.

           Prowl added a new Spark engine to his
configuration to improve his mobility and searching ability. With high-capacity
radars on both his shoulders, he can instantly find enemies hiding in a
300 km radius. And once he finds them, they're history. He has electronic
systems for jamming radios or hacking into systems.
