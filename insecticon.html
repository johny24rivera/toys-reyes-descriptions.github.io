    Beast mode is a beetle.
Although nice-looking, his robot hands are clearly visible from any angle.
His robot feet are also visible from his back side as well. His wings can
also open up so he can fly.  What is nice is that he can stand up
on his insect legs in the mode, unlike most other insect transformers.
Unfortunately, except for the wings, there are pretty much no points of
articulation in this mode, so you've basically got a cool-looking brick.

    Robot mode is decent.
He can stand up well on his big flat feet, but his insect legs get in the
way, as well as his insect jaw. Also, his crossbow that can be put together
(the two halves are inside the insect wings) is small and is very easy
to lose.(As I did.) :( The detailing in this mode is only so-so.

    Overall, okay, but nothing
really seems to stand out in this transformer.
