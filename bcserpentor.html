     Serpent O.R. is a bit
of an oddball homage, referencing a G.I. JOE (COBRA) character-- Serpentor--
rather than a previously known Transformer. This is basically Serpentor
in Transformer form-- in most cases I wouldn't like something like this
being part of the
     <i>
      Transformers
     </i>
     Club Subscription Service, instead
of being a GIJOE Club or shared club exclusive-- but man, this looks good.
This mold works quite well for the regal character, with the main colors
being a rather jungle-y shade of green, metallic dark purple (mostly along
the borders of pieces, as well as the feet/nosecone and part of the waist),
and a dull goldish tan that's used mostly for the back part of the vehicle
mode and the main body and arms of the robot mode. It's basically about
as close as plastic can get to gold since it's not actually painted, and
it's a big positive that all three of these colors are either metallic
or have a good about of glitter/metallic flake in the plastic, so nothing
looks dull-- all three colors are great, they fit the character, and most
importantly they contrast against each other VERY well. From a back view
there's a bit too much unbroken green, but otherwise Serpent O.R.'s colors
are broken up pretty well. There's also some nice metallic green used on
the gold plastic in robot mode and on the cockpit windows, which also looks
nice, as well as some metallic gold paint used for the Cobra symbol on
the nosecone and a few other minor details. The best part of Serpent O.R.,
though, is definitely how they take the chest and paint it to look a snake
face, complete with fangs in silver. Considering this mold obviously was
not made with Serpentor in mind AT ALL, this is just soooo well done. There's
also a bit of silver on the engines, and some gold paint on the robot mode
claws/fingers.

     Serpent O.R. doesn't
have any mold changes made specifically for him, but he does use the Senator
Ratbat headsculpt previously released with this mold only in Japan. This
is another ingenious inclusion, as even completely unchanged this headsculpt
works VERY well for Serpentor. The silver face, side vents, transparent
yellow eye piping, and bright green on the "animal eyes" on the forehead
all
help bring it out even more.

     Serpent O.R. may not
be your traditional Transformers homage, but he's a fantastic Transformers
version of Serpentor, with great colors, a lot of metallic shades and paint
apps, and particularly masterfully-done paint on his main body to make
it look like a snake head. I really don't know much about Serpentor other
than how he looks, and normally I'd be a little miffed that he took up
a slot in the TFSS, but this is done so well that even if you don't care
about the character, I'd recommend this toy if you're in the market for
Club exclusives because it's a pretty darned good mold in a fantastic color
scheme-- the best this mold's gotten as of this writing (1/19).

       After his encounter with four Autobots
rekindled his lust for domination, a washed-out terrorist tracked down
the discarded body of a Sweep and used it as a recipient for data from
an old COBRA project to combine the military acumen from the greatest strategic
minds of Earth's past. The EDC disrupted the operation, but in the process
General "Clayton" Hawk Abernathy was knocked into a Brainwave Scanner and
his personality uploaded to the amalgamated consciousness. The result is
a being who, nominally, identifies with COBRA and their occasional allies,
the Decepticons, and yet finds himself sympathetic to the cause of the
Earth Defense Command, which he remembers founding and leading. This dissonance
hampers his otherwise brilliant tactical mind, but even his divided processor
is capable of generating ruthless, inventive plans of incredible subtlety.
