not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Scorponok. For

     Double Punch is another
super-obscure character, in that "almost G2" era of the early '90s in Europe.
The original Double Punch was an "Action Master Elite", which, paradoxically,
could actually transform into scorpion-- so it makes sense that the Energon
Scorponok mold would be used for a new version for him, as they both look
quite similar overall. And, like many toys from that era, Double Punch
has a REALLY fruity color scheme. Black, orange, and blue-- okay, sounds
good so far... oh yeah, and he's got lots of that seafoam green and hot
pink that Transformers from that era seemed to love so much. The pink is
a particularly noxious shade, as well, and doesn't look good particularly
against the seafoam green. That said, having black as a main color does
help to tone down the brightness of the color scheme quite a bit, and the
dark blue and particularly the orange go excellently with that main color.
The bits of red, silver, and gold on the chest help him to look a bit more
unique in that area, as well. Unfortunately, with the exception of the
aforementioned main body, Double Punch is oddly bereft of paint apps for
a Botcon exclusive-- he doesn't have any paint apps at all on his tail
and arms, and his legs only have to small orange stripes on each tread.
Granted, his color scheme is already busy, but still...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Double Punch-- he has the same slide-to-flip-out gun feature
on his tail that Energon Scorponok had, and not the Cyber Key-activated
tail guns that
     <a href="dkscorponok.html">
      Dark Scorponok
     </a>
     had. Like
almost all large Botcon toys, his electronics have also been gutted to
keep costs down.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon 2010 Double Punch,
like many others from this year, is a toy that you'll love if you're of
the "it's so hideous it's brilliant" sort, but not at all one to seek out
if you like more realistic color schemes. Regardless, his lack of paint
apps beyond his main body is a bit of a head-scratcher given his cost and
exclusivity.

       Unruly, destructive and bad tempered
are some of the nicer terms that have been attributed to Double Punch.
Foul mouthed and intimidating, Double Punch is always the first to spark
a fight, preferably leading to a riot. When there is no one to fight, he'll
seek out random property to destroy. During his time in the gladiatorial
pits of Cybertron, he would often destroy his enemies and then tear a section
of the stadium down (destroying several audience members with it). Cunning
and cynical, Double Punch knows how to play allies against each other to
advance his own goals. His armor is forged from hardened metal mined from
the desert regions of Cybertron, giving him the ability to take heat well
above 150 degrees Fahrenheit. His claws have diamond edged blades to slice
into enemy armor and his stinger can fire 500,000 volt electric bursts.
