      Powerlinx Inferno's color
scheme is definitely a radical departure from his older version's- instead
of being given a dull and worn look, Inferno has a much lighter, "fresh"
color scheme. The white, black, and periwinkle go marvelously with one
another, but that bluish-black used for his missile launcher and arms...
not so good. It's the color of a bad bruise, yick. Why couldn't they have
just made it solid black instead? Although, as much as I like the color
scheme by itself, it isn't quite as fitting a mobile artillery truck as
the old green scheme was.

      Powerlinx Inferno is
a good Minicon with a good color scheme. However, it's not quite up to
par with the older one, since it's not as fitting.

        Powerlinx Thrust's color
scheme is a bit of a throwback to the Generation One plane named
        <a href="g1dirge.html">
         Dirge
        </a>
        .
Granted, the color schemes of them both are a bit different, but the similarity
is apparent. Overall, brown seems to work for Thrust better than gray-and-green
did; it seems to suit a thruster plane more, for some reason. The black
and silver paint detailing on the wings is really eye-catching, and the
periwinkle and brown go together well. Additional silver paint detailing
on some of Thrust's mechanical innards and the bronze stuff on the cockpit
is also great. Additionally, I really like the paint "mask" on Thrust's
face- it makes him look like a superhero. This is especially appreciated,
since the older Thrust barely had any paint on his face at all. However,
there's that darn problem of the bluish-black again; it's just a horrid
color to use, especially when just plain black would have worked better.

        Although not leagues
greater than his predecessor, Powerlinx Thrust is a noticeable step above
the original Thrust color-scheme wise, and with the exception of the bluish-black,
looks great whether you're playing with it or whether it's just sitting
on a shelf. Recommended.
