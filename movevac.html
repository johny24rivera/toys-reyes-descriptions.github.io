    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Movie Voyager Blackout
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Movie Voyager
Blackout toy

     Evac's colors are appropriate
for a Coast Guard rescue helicopter, with orange, white, and black being
the main colors visible together. All three colors contast quite well together
and catch the eye (as a rescue vehicle's colors should, obviously). The
gray is a pretty dull shade, but an appropriately realistic one. One thing
that's pretty cool about Evac's "number" markings on his sides-- "EV1015-07"--
is that if you take away the "EV", the numbers correspond to the date that
the Transformers Movie DVD was released in the U.S.-- October 15th, 2007.
The electric "Allspark Blue" color is revealed in robot mode, and there's
quite a bit of it in proportion to most other Allspark Power toys, to the
point where it's a main color in Evac's robot mode. It goes quite well
against all of Evac's colors, though, so for such a light color it fits
in very well (except blue paint on his gray waist, I don't think that looks
too great-- at least it doesn't outright clash, though).

     Evac is a somewhat extensive
remold of Blackout, as well. His robot head has been remolded completely,
with a more Autobot-ish, less evil-looking facade. His head design actually
sort of looks like a piece of diving suit headgear, which certainly fits
his Coast Guard vehicle mode. In place of Blackout's tiny partner Scorponok,
Evac has a lifeboat that flops out of the rear end of his helicopter mode
instead, and which turns, ironically, into a handheld gun in robot mode.
Quite an ingenious use of a lifeboat, I have to say. Evac's robot hands
have also been remolded so that he can hold the lifeboat-gun in them, though
other than the new "clenched" position of the hand it looks exactly like
Blackout's three-fingered hand. Making it a five-fingered hand or something
of the sort would have helped Evac look a bit more different from Blackout
in that respect, I think. Other than these changes, no remolds have been
made to Evac-- sadly, he still has the same misaligning gears and non-working
"Automorph" feature that Blackout has.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Evac is a nice repaint
if you want something a bit more colorful than Blackout, or if you like
rescue vehicles more than military-colored vehicles, but I'm not either
of those. As such, I'd recommend Blackout over this toy, though there's
nothing wrong with its colors and remolds perse, I just like Blackout's
look and colors a little better.

       When Evac received the transmission
from Optimus Prime, inviting the surviving Autobots to Earth, he knew he
was needed there immediately. The final battle against Megatron could only
have resulted in massive damage to the world, which meant that his skills
would be critical. As a rescue specialist, Evac has spent his life traveling
from one disaster zone to the next, protecting and saving those he could.
He is totally fearless, willing to risk anything to help his fellow sentient
creatures.
