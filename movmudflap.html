    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Mudflap. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Mudflap

     Movie Mudflap has a paint
deco very fitting for a construction vehicle, with a dull yellow being
by far the dominant color in vehicle mode. He's a bit of an homage to G1
Erector. White becomes a much more dominant color in robot mode, though
it still remains the secondary color by any measure. Each taken by themselves,
these colors are fine-- but together, they just don't mix well. They're
both light colors, and so don't contrast very well against each other at
all. The black, silver, and metallic bronze serve as accent colors in both
modes, and look great against the yellow and white. (I think the black
would have benefited slightly from being a "purer" black, but it still
looks good either mode.) The black stripes on the crane arm and the Cyber
Key-activated missile launcher look especially nice. And there's plenty
of paint apps on all parts of Mudflap, so no worries about large, barren
areas here. Still, the bronze and black look so good I wish they had been
a main plastic color to go against all that white and yellow.

     Movie Mudflap has no
mold changes, though his Cyber Key is now a "standard" transparent purple
Decepticon Cyber Key, like the other Movie Cybertron redecos have.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Movie Mudflap has a
much more realistic color scheme than Cybertron Mudflap, but that doesn't
keep it from being loud, without a major dark color in there. He does have
lots of paint apps that go great with his two main bright colors, though,
on the positive side. Still, I'd recommend Cybertron Mudflap over this
version.

     <i>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Mudflap long ago earned the reputation
as one of the most vicious of the Decepticons, known for turning his molecule-edge
saw on weakened or disabled Autobot warriors. Little does anyone suspect,
however, but his cruelty arises from his own conflicted feelings about
the war. For ages, he has doubted the Decepticon cause, and secretly yearned
to join the Autobots. His reputation is so monstrous that Optimus Prime
would never trust him, and so he is condemned to continue serving Megatron,
and taking out his frustrations on his captives.
