    Starscream's jet mode
makes a littl' chibi return for the Tiny Turbo Changers line in
    <i>
     The
Last Knight
    </i>
    , even if only his head shows up for a second in the actual
movie. Starscream's alternate mode is even more superdeformed than most
in the line, with a very large, rounded cockpit and MUCH smaller main wings
compared to the actual jet-- though the tailfins are actually oversized
in comparison to it all, interestingly enough. As you'd expect from a jet
Transformer-- especially one so simple-- yes, there's some robot kibble,
here. The robot legs are the most obvious, sticking out from underneath
the bottom with the feet especially obvious under the back end, but the
arms are pretty apparent too-- they do stick out of the sides a fair bit
in this mode, though the way the wings are proportioned the arms also form
the outer part of said wings, so you can't completely ignore them either.
From the back end you can also see the top of the robot head, but this
is relatively small potatoes. The mold detailing is impressive, with lots
of little aerodynamic lines and details where appropriate in this mode.
The paint detailing can be pretty impressive too-- this is definitely the
version of Starscream from movies 2-3, as he has the black alien tattoos
on him to make him look more visually interesting, and they're surprisingly
intricate and accurate. It helps, since his plastic is all light gray,
which isn't exactly exciting. He also has some muddy brown paint on his
cockpit.

    Starscream's transformation
definitely took some inspiration from his

    , since as with the Legends toy, the arms come off from
the sides and the legs swing out from the bottom to take him into robot
mode. Of course, being a TTT, he's even simpler-- the entire jet mode's
on his back, and he's rather 2-D from a side view. Hasbro certainly tried
with Starscream in this mdoe, but at the budget he still has some definite
kibble-- the tailfins are very obvious sticking out above his shoulders,
and the cockpit coming out of his butt is pretty awkward, too. Plus, due
to the jet mode proportions, the head is scrunched up a bit into the shoulders,
giving Starscream even less of a neck than he already had. That said, the
mold detailing is still very intricate, with all of the little chest bits
and bobbles that are major details on the actual design, along with a pretty
accurate oversized face (with red eyes), and some intricate hip and knee
detailing. Unfortunately due to their thin size, the arms aren't detailed
much on the lower ends, though they are fitted to hold TTT/Legion-sized
weapons. Unfortunately, all of this mold detailing is mostly lost in all
the gray, as the eyes contain the only paint in this mode. For articulation,
Starscream can move at his shoulders.

    Movie Starscream is
a very hard design to get done well on a small budget, and although Hasbro
tried admirably with this Tiny Turbo Changer, they just couldn't quite
pull it off. The mold detailing-- and the paint on the wings-- is amazing
for the size, and the jet mode is pretty decent overall if a bit heavy
in the back end. The robot mode has some pretty awkward proportional and
kibble issues, though. One of the weaker TTT molds.
