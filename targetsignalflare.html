    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Signal Flare. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Signal Flare

     This "more realistic"
deco of the Signal Flare mold, done this way to fit into the movieverse,
looks quite a bit like Offshoot. A bit TOO much for my liking, in fact,
as green is the dominant color in the same places as it was on
     <a href="offshoot.html">
      Offshoot
     </a>
     .
There's a brown military-esque camo pattern on the green parts, but it
doesn't seem to be used enough look like a bonafied camo pattern, in my
opinion. The overall colors of brown, gray, black, and green do fit well
together and certainly don't clash, but... Signal Flare's color scheme
is just so slagging DULL when compared to either of this mold's previous
color schemes, especially since the pretty transparent red parts have now
just been replaced with a solid gray. I understand the rationale to mute
the colors a bit to fit in with the whole "realism" factor, but the toys
should still should be cool to look at. He also seems to have less paint
apps than this mold's previous versions. The silver used on parts of the
robot legs and the dish-emitter-arm do contrast very well against their
surrounding colors, even if they're not used enough. The Sector 7 logo
on the back of Signal Flare's right arm is also a nice touch, to help him
"fit in with the enemy," so to speak.

     No mold changes have
been made to Movie Signal Flare.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Movie Signal Flare is
my least recommended out of the various paint jobs this mold has gotten,
simply because it's just so incredibly dull and boring. Get the original
Signal Flare, or, better yet, Offshoot instead unless you absolutely can't
find either of those for a reasonable price.

       Wired more for hard work than the heat
of combat, Signal Flare prefers to remain hidden in the background, rather
than on the front lines with Optimus Prime. On Earth, he stays in his vehicle
mode and works secretly with humans to construct buildings capable of resisting
even the mighty weapons of the Transformers. When duty calls, however he
uses his powerful radar dish to transmit information between hidden Autobot
cells in preparation for the coming battle over the AllSpark.
