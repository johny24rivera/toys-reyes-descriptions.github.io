    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Arcee. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Arcee

     An interesting story
behind Chromia; as is evident to G1 fans from her color scheme and head
design, she was originally meant to be called Moonracer after her G1 counterpart,
but that name wasn't available, so instead Chromia, another one of the
G1 Autobot femmes who never got a toy, was chosen as a name. Regardless,
the color scheme is spot-on Moonracer, and is a fairly nice color scheme
when taken by itself; green, white, black, and gray go pretty well together,
and are fitting for a fembot. And I really REALLY like the transparent
plastic used for her Energon chip and crossbow; it's a really nice-looking
color. However, I think she's a bit too similar to Arcee for something
as expensive as a Botcon exclusive-- it looks too much like they too Energon
Arcee's color scheme and replaced the pink and red with green. There are
a few minor paint app differences, such as on the upper legs, but most
of the paint apps and color distributions are otherwise the same. The new
headsculpt helps to differentiate some, though, and is overall pretty good;
pretty close to G1 Moonracer while still having a few new creative twists
to it, and it's got fairly good mold and excellent paint detailing. The
only thing is I'm not too fond of the yellow chin "armor piece" detailing--
at this scale, it looks more like Chromia engulfed a hot dog and has a
bunch of mustard on her face or something.

     Chromia has a pretty
nice color scheme when taken by itself, and her face sculpt is pretty good,
but her color scheme is a bit too similar to Energon Arcee's for a Botcon
exclusive. As such, it's one of my least favorite toy from the 2005 BotCon.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       For millions of years, Chromia served
as one of the crack troops of the Autobot underground on Cybertron. While
tough and determined, Chromia retains a wry sense of humor. She believes
that words are fairly meaningless without action to back them up. It is
a philosophy she employs in and out of combat. Her blunt honesty sometimes
puts off other Autobots, but those who truly understand her know that this
is her way of honoring the Autobot ideal of truth. Chromia is extremely
protective of Flareup, whom she has agreed to watch after, out of respect
for her comrade Firestar.

       Abilities: In vehicle mode, Chromia
is able to reach a top speed of 320 mph. Her tires have been specially
reinforced to withstand most artillery fire. Combined with her side mounted
missile launcher and grenade launcher, she is a force to be wreckoned with
in battle. In robot mode, Chromia is extremely agile and able to move quickly
around the battlefield while firing her combined weapon with deadly accuracy.

       Weakness: Chromia is not very adept
at creative thinking, preferring to use brute force most of the time.
