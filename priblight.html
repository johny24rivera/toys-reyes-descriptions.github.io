    Blight is a Prime-stylized
update of the G1 Terrorcon Blot, who became a sort of walking mechanical
nose-thing. Thankfully, Blight here has a much better alt mode. He's certainly
the least dragon-like out of all the Prime Predacons, but he definitely
has a humanoid monster-ish quality to him, with relatively gorilla-like
proportions, and some large claws on his hands and a ridged fin along his
long head and neck to give him at least a little bit of a "dragon" feel
to him. His mold detaling is also mostly ornamental and often looking like
armor plating (as it is with most Prime Predacons). His dragon face is
incredibly fierce-looking, with deep mold detailing outlining deep-set
eyes, a large toothy maw, and lots of little face crest-like details. As
far as robot mode extras, there are two pretty obvious ones-- namely, the
fists sticking out of the sides of his feet. Other than that, he's extra-free
in this mode, though his lower hand-claws are unfortunately stuck in place
due to them becoming heels in robot mode. Blight's color scheme largely
apes his G1 predecessor's, but with a bit more emphasis on blue as opposed
to purple. The main two colors of dark blue and light pale bluish purple
go incredibly well together, both complementing each other and contrasting
against each other because of the relative brightness/darkness of each.
The blue plastic and paint also has a really nice semi-metallic sheen to
it, which is pretty much always a plus to me. There's also a few yellow
paint apps on Blight's various crests on his head/neck, stomach, and elbows,
which also contrasts excellently against the dark blue. For articulation
in this mode, Blight can move at the shoulders, elbow rotation, slight
articulation at the top claws on each hand (as one piece), and movement
at the hips. For a Legion-class toy, it's a bit above-average-- I wish
his ankles or feet had a bit of movement, but other than that he's pretty
great in this respect. Blight comes with the hammer weapon that comes with
many Beast Hunters Legion class figures, painted a nice dark gunmetal gray.
Blight can store it in a hole on the side of either of his shoulders in
this mode, but it does stick out a bit regardless.

    Blight's transformation
is slightly more involved than you might expect-- given that he goes from
humanoid monster to humanoid robot-- but it's still pretty easy, it just
has some unexpected twists, like turning him upside down and sliding in
the shoulders while the hips simultaneously slide outwards. The end result
is a very nice-looking robot mode, that retains most of the monster-ish
aspects of Blight, but with a humanoid robot head and more humanoid proportions.
His beast mode was pretty good, but this is the better of the two modes,
with no awkward kibble at all. (The feet hang off the arms a little, but
they aren't nearly as obvious as the robot hands were in beast mode.) His
beast head also hangs off his back, but it sticks on place quite well,
doesn't stick out, and doesn't get in the way of articulation, so I don't
mind it at all. His dragon claws make for great feet, and his headsculpt
is also pretty darned good, with a red strip for his visor and a silver
toothed mouth to keep a little of that "monster" look to him. The detailing
on his chest also looks great with the light purple and yellow paint on
all the armor-like mold detailing. There is a bit of a hollow space behind
his head, but I don't see how they could have gotten rid of this with his
transformation, and it's a minor downside at best. In this mode, Blight's
articulation is at the shoulders (at two points), inward at the wrists,
and at the hips, knee rotation, and slight rotation at the ankles. This
is definitely pretty good for a Legion class toy, so no complaints here.
As you'd expect, Blight can hold his hammer in either of his fist holes
quite snugly in this mode.

    Beast Hunters Blight
may not have the most different-looking modes out of the Prime Predacons,
but he still looks quite unique and fearsome in both modes, with generally
great proportions in both (particularly in robot mode), a nice and fairly
original color scheme, nice paint detailing, and only a little kibble (like
his robot fists). His transformation is also both fun, unexpected, and
simple. If you're at all a fan of the Prime Predacons and/or Legion-class
beastformers, I'd recommend this one as a pickup. My second-favorite of
the updated Legion class "Terrorcons".
