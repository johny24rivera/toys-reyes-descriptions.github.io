    Starscream's jet mode
gets appropriately "chibi-fied" for the little kid-friendly Activators
line, and honestly for a chubby jet he looks decent. You pretty much have
to accept that the proportions are going to be all out-of-whack for the
alt modes in this subline, so for the most part there's no issues here.
The bottom bits stick out too far (about halfway up the nosecone), and
the robot hands are fairly obvious being only partially hidden by the rear
wings as they are, but everything else proportionally off can be chalked
up to "it's a young kids' line". The gray plastic predominantly used for
Starscream-- while, of course, movie-accurate-- won't exactly wow kids
with its color scheme, though Starscream's black tats on his wings and
light gold cockpit might help alleviate that somewhat. The red "Activator"
button on the back end also kind looks like tail exhaust, so the gimmick
works on Starscream in this mode without being an eyesore.

    As with all Dark of
the Moon Activators, Starscream is simply transformed by pushing down on
the big button (in this case red) on the rear side of his vehicle mode
and standing him up. Because he's not a ground-based vehicle, Starscream
looks a bit different from the other Activators in robot mode-- and in
a VERY bad way. As opposed to the front halves of his vehicle mode becoming
shoulder-arms with arm detailing molded inside, Starscream has ridiculously
oversized shoulders made up out of the halves of most of his jet mode,
with his lower arms actually made out of the wings. His arms can move back-and-forth
at the shoulders and-- very oddly-- at a joint that's at his waist, as
opposed to his shoulders. Even taking into account the simple transformation
gimmick of the line, this just looks really dumb here, there's no getting
around it. That said, the mold detailing on his robot parts, head, and
leg panel that flips into place over his bottom end is pretty impressive
(and that's not to say his vehicle mode detailing wasn't nice already)--
pretty much all the necessary details are there, slightly cutsy-fied but
not overly so (these are giant death machines, after all).

    DotM Activator Starscream
has a cutesy jet mode that's appropriate enough for the line, but his extremely
awkward-looking robot mode (even taking into account the all-but-automatic
transformation gimmick of the line) and some visible robot extras in vehicle
mode don't do him any favors. My least favorite of the DotM Activators
subline.

      Starscream is no coward. He's just careful.
He would always prefer to retreat in the face of defeat than stand and
be destroyed. He has survived as long as he has because he's willing to
run away when he knows he's beaten. Still, that doesn't stop him from blasting
the Autobots every chance he gets.
