    Sideswipe's warrior class
figure has a VERY accurate vehicle mode when compared to the show model,
at least when it comes to proportions. Pretty much all the angles and the
detailing is spot-on, and there's no robot extras whatsoever unless you
count the little bits of the upper legs you can see if you look reaally
intently inside the tinted windows. Even by RID2015 standards, the mold
detailing is minimal on the car mode, with only a few basic angles along
the main body. There are a few areas with a good amount of detailing, though--
namely the front and the back. The front bumper has nice angular headlights
and porous grill detailing, while the back bumper has taillights, more
porous exhaust vent details, and tailpipes. As is unfortunately the norm,
though, Sideswipe's paint apps are pretty basic, and a little disappointing.
For one, there isn't enough red to be show-accurate, specifically near
the back top of this mode. There is some red paint on the side doors and
front hood, but it's noticeably lighter than the dark red and doesn't look
all that great. There's also some light red used for the Japanese symbols
near the rear sides, but of course that's supposed to stick out against
the surrounding red a bit. There's some light blue on the front headlights,
but that's it as far as other colors of paint; no paint at all on the back
bumper, a real shame there. As for weapon storage, yes, Sideswipe's sword
just kinda pegs in on the top of the hood. It's pretty darned obvious,
and I wish it was on the underside instead, but at least it pegs in solidly
and stays there.

    Even for a Warrior,
Sideswipe's transformation is a bit more complex and unorthodox (though
I still wouldn't call it hard). The entire front side sections of the car
mode fold around and in behind the robot chest piece, the front bumper
folds behind the back, and then the back side sections rotate around the
inner side sections along with the feet to form the legs. For the MOST
part, from a frontal view this mode looks pretty accurate-- the legs are
a little large proportionally (the feet in particular, and there is a noticeable
gap in between the feet and the bottom of the lower legs if you look closely),
and his main body could stand to be just a TOUCH wider, but generally things
are pretty good. There is a bit of kibble, with obvious car doors on the
sides of his lower arms-- that said, at least these pieces are bolted onto
the lower arms instead of the arms just being molded into the car doors,
so props to Hasbro for that. The front section behind the back does mostly
stay out of the way from a frontal view (except for the front bumper, which
is pretty darned obvious behind Sideswipe's head and shoulders), but from
a side view it's rather unsightly, given the gap between Sideswipe's main
body and that car front. It also sticks out a bit from the side if you're
looking at him from an angular view. These are all minor issues, though,
compared to the MAJOR issue-- Sideswipe's shoulders don't lock in place.
AT ALL. The side front sections of the car also pop up pretty awkwardly
in between his shoulders and his back, and don't lock into place either,
so it's pretty easy to make them look a little awkward if you don't angle
them just so. Just a (working) tab on the main body on each side, that's
all it would have taken. At least the fold-up chest panel helps hide this
issue a little bit. His head is sculpted pretty accurately, with the "punk
hairdo" at the top. He's got silver paint on his smirking face, along with
light blue on the eyes, faux car headlights on the chest, and a bit above
the waist. He's also got some black on the kneecaps and some lighter red
for the Japanese symbols on his chest. Otherwise, he sticks to the basic
red/black color scheme of his vehicle mode, and not much additional mold
detailing has been added to his robot mode parts beyond the basic head
design and chest sculpt. As for articulation, he can move at the head,
shoulders (at four points, though one of them is transformational and really
shouldn't be moved, but you inevitably will accidentally move it), elbows,
hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and back-and-forth at the
ankles, so he's certainly the most articulated RID2015 Sideswipe toy.

    I applaud Hasbro for
trying something different than the norm for Warrior Sideswipe's transformation,
with some really unique rotations of the sides of his vehicle to form his
robot mode. For the most part it works, except for the shoulders-- make
no mistake, the shoulders are pretty darned annoying when posing, as they
don't lock into place at all and the odd angles of the car bits poking
up between his shoulders and head make it look even weirder. There's also
a bit of kibble on his lower arms and behind his back, and some missing
paint apps, but it's all minor compared to the shoulders. If you can stand
the shoulders, by all means this is otherwise a pretty good toy-- just
temper your expectations going in.
