    Brawn's Titan Master
robot mode-- appropriately-- has the general colors and details of Brawn,
"stretched" and "squeezed" into the default Titan Master proportions. The
arms are fairly straightforward, with little fists molded on the inside,
though the details on the legs are more definitively Brawn's, with mold
lines near the middle that mimic Brawn's "rotated back bumper section",
along with his circular feet. The chest detailing also mimics Brawn's chest,
though in a nice twist, the Titan Master's headsculpt is based off his
G1 toy head, which looks more robotic than he looked in the G1 'toon. He
still has the same dome head (with a bit of a block behind it, since it
does have to fit into Titan Returns toys' neck slots, after all), but he
has the original toy's single visor and Prime-like faceplate. Unfortunately
Brawn has no paint in this mode whatsoever, which is a bummer particularly
for the legs and head, which are definitely the wrong color. The overall
basic color scheme of dark military green and orangish yellow is definitely
accurate to Brawn and the colors contrast with each other fairly well--
I just wish there was some accent colors, is all. As with all Titan Masters,
in robot mode Brawn can move at the neck, shoulders, and back-and-forth
at the hips and knees (both legs move as one, since they're connected at
said knees). In head mode, the sculpt is definitely G1 cartoon Brawn, with
a nice dark metallic gunmetal gray dome head (with a few minor extra details),
a kind of grumpy face with silver paint, and light blue eyes-- the look
on his face definitely fits Brawn's character. Because Titan Masters' head
modes have to be fairly square, though, there are little dark green "antennae"
behind Brawn's dome head, which are a little bit of an eyesore, admittedly.

    One of the modes of
the accessory that comes with Titan Master Brawn is, appropriately, a 4WD
vehicle. Brawn sticks in upside down in his head mode in the middle to
help give some more "bulk" to the center of this mode. Overall it looks
like a "squished", treaded version of Brawn's vehicle mode. I do love the
replacement of the wheels with large triangular black tread details, which
really helps make this mode look more unique. The top of the vehicle mode
doesn't "stick up" above the body as much as it should, but it generally
looks good, with a little flip-up windshield in front of where the Titan
Master slots into (the Titan Masters' legs essentially work as a "roof"
in this mode). The sides are a bit overly high/large, but not to an extent
where it really bothers me. There are two large "nubs" on the front and
back of this mode, due to the transformation, which are minor eyesores.
The mold detailing in this mode is stellar, with not just the treads and
molded-in wheels very well-detailed, but vents, armor "bolts", springs,
and the like molded in all over the place. The front also looks like Brawn's
vehicle grill, complete with the circular headlights on the side. Unfortunately
beyond the treads though, this mold has no paint detailing-- and particularly
on the front "grill", it could've used some.

    For the accessory's
other vehicle mode, you flip out and around the tread side-pieces, turn
the toy upside down, and then flip down the windshield piece and let Brawn
ride in Titan Master mode in the center. This is a bit of an unconventional
alt mode-- given how skinny it is in one dimension and having no discernable
wheels or wings-- but it actually reminds me a lot of those "hoverski"-things
Stormtroopers ride in Star Wars. The tread pieces have pegged together,
with the tread details essentially removed from this mode and replaced
with more armor and circuitry details on the front and back end, with little
gun protrusions on the front and back as well. The middle section is comparatively
barren in terms of mold detailing, though still servicable. Yet again,
though, with the exception of the little bits of tread detailing poking
out, there's no paint in this mode.

    The accessory's weapon
mode is-- like most other Titan Master sets' weapon modes-- a bit of an
afterthought and a "midpoint" between the two main vehicle modes, but in
this case it actually works. It's just the 4WD mode with the front tread
sections tabbed together like for the "hoverski" mode, but with the rear
tread sections left as-is and the peg piece slid out further from the bottom
for a larger robot to hold. That said, it's proportioned quite a lot like
a gun, and the two little blaster details on the front make it clear it
is a shooter.

    The Titan Master Brawn
set is one of the best toys from this small size category in the entire
Titans Return line. The headsculpt for the Titan Master is solid, and both
of the vehicle modes of the accessory are rather unique and look pretty
nice. The weapon mode-- although not as individualistic-- still easily
looks like a gun, and isn't as much of a stretch as most of the other Titan
Master sets' weapon modes. The toy desperately needs some more paint apps,
though-- only having them on the treads is just waaay too limited, even
keeping in mind the budget.
