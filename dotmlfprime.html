    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM deluxe
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     I'm not really sure about
the "lunar" part of Optimus Prime's fire-- who associates the moon with
fire?-- but fire definitely takes the center spotlight in this Optimus
redeco, moreso even than typical amongst movie Prime toys. Optimus' core
colors of red, blue, and gray are still here, but mostly in different places,
with red forming a larger part of the main cab area of the vehicle mode
and arms in robot mode. The red is a slightly duller shade than normal,
but not so much so that it looks boring. The blue--used more on the cab's
nose this time around--has been significantly darkened to an almost purplish
hue, and looks VERY nice against all the colors, but the metallic shades
of paint in particular. The silver paint is mostly in the same places as
on the original toy, and same with the gray (though at least with the gray
plastic this time around, it's not a milky, overly light color, and so
doesn't look too bad on the parts that it's used on). The highlight of
this figure is DEFINITELY the incredible metallic bronzish-gold paint apps
used for the flames on the truck nose (as well as most other details on
said nose), as well as extra flames on the side silver tanks, and a bit
on the top of the cab. Prime's also got some gold on his lower legs in
robot mode. This shade is just a REALLY eye-catching color and goes marvelously
with the other colors, the dark purplish blue in particular.

     No mold changes have
been made to Lunarfire Optimus Prime, though the Mechtech weapon he comes
with has been changed-- he now comes with the
     <a href="dotmoptimus.html">
      original
DotM voyager Optimus Prime's
     </a>
     Mechtech weapon, which is a decent enough
weapon but is scaled to a voyager, so it looks a bit overly large in Lunarfire
Prime's hands.

     Lunarfire Optimus Prime
is a fantastic repaint of an already pretty darned awesome mold. The purplish
blue plastic and bronzish-gold paint are particular highlights when it
comes to Prime's new scheme. If you get one version of this mold, make
this it-- it's also a nice pickup if you are curious about the mold, but
don't want movie Prime's "same old, same old" color scheme. Highly recommended.
