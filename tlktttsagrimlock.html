    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original TLK Tiny Turbo
Changer Grimlock toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the original TLK TTT Grimlock toy

     Shadow Armor Grimlock
is basically Grimlock in what have traditionally been "evil clone"-ish
colors for Transformers-- i.e., he's mostly black, particularly in beast
mode, where he has no other paint apps or other colors beyond just red
eyes (which is a shame, given all the molded-in details that are kind of
washed out by the dark plastic color). In robot mode, however, his colors
get more interesting, with some dark purple coloration along the line down
his forehead crest, on his faceplate, and on his chest. I do wish the purple
was just a titch lighter to contrast against the black better, but it still
looks great. The moderately light blue eyes are also cool-looking, though
they aren't teal like your typical "Nemesis" colors. Still, keeping in
mind the budget/limitations of the Tiny Turbo Changer pricepoint, this
is a pretty nice redeco.
