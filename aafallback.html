    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Brawn.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen
Brawn

     Fallback is an homage
to the G1 toy Outback, which is appropriate, given that Outback was also
a redeco of the original G1 Brawn toy. Anyways, Fallback here roughly homages
Outback's color scheme, but isn't too slavish to it. A very light tan--
almost white-- makes up most of his vehicle mode colors. That by itself
would be rather boring, but there's several black and silver paint apps
on that mode, which really help to add some contrast. That said, however,
his alt mode still is a a bit duller than I would've liked it to be. In
robot mode, however, his colors really pop, with the dull brownish red
contrasting excellently against both the black and the light tan. It gives
Fallback a "muddy" look, which works well with his original "Outback" name.
The silver and dull orange paint apps-- particularly on his chest-- really
help to add that finishing touch and really make him rather pretty to stare
at. There's also dark charcoal plastic parts here and there, but they don't
really contribute much to the color scheme, and might've well just have
been black. Because Fallback is from the "Reveal the Shield" subline, he
has a rub allegiance symbol on his front vehicle section-- rub it to reveal
he's an Autobot.

     Autobot Alliance Fallback
is a pretty cool repaint of the Brawn mold, and a bit more visually interesting
overall-- the brownish red is especially nice-looking. I wish his vehicle
mode had a bit more color variety, but overall I'd recommend him over RotF
Brawn.

       Fallback has never been particularly
interested in following the rules. The fastest way between two points,
after all, is a straight line. Given a destination, Fallback will gladly
drive straight to it, smashing through or knocking over anything that gets
in his way.
