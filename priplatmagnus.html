    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Prime "Robots in Disguise"
Weaponizer Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review
of the Prime "Robots in Disguise" Weaponizer Optimus Prime figure

     Given how the "Beast
Hunters" version of Ultra Magnus is a remold of the original Prime Optimus
Prime, I suppose a remold of the Weaponizer mold into Magnus was inevitable--
having it come out as a "Platinum Edition" instead of a mainline release
was a surprise, though. Ultra Magnus keeps his basic "patriotic" color
scheme of blue, white, and red intact on this version, but they're VERY
nice shades of the color. The dark blue in particular is a magnificent
shade-- it's substantially darker than the blues used on other Prime Magnus
toys, and contrasts extremely well with both the pure white plastic and
dull red parts throughout his chassis. He's also got a few bits of black,
such as the requisite tires; some silver paint here and there; and there's
a bit of light blue in terms of some paint apps on his chest and on his
hammer, along with just a touch of yellow on his headlights (or fake headlights,
in the case of the robot mode detailing). It all makes for an incredibly
gorgeous color scheme-- I wish more Magnus toys had this dark blue, in
particular. Being a Platinum Edition toy, he's also got planty of paint
apps (mostly red and white) throughout his form, so no large portion of
him is left unbroken by other colors.

     Ultra Magnus also has
several mold changes made to make the toy look much closer to his Beast
Hunters design. Obviously his head is remolded (with a spot-on, crisp,
show-accurate sculpt), but his large shoulder pieces are also new, as is
his chest in robot mode and vehicle roof. He's also got a BIG new weapon
accessory, the Hammer of Solus Prime that he acquires in the TV series.
It's nearly as huge comparative to Ultra Magnus that it is in the show,
so it's a nice, beefy hammer that really gives him a "strongman" presence
even moreso than he already had. (It also has handles so that he can hold
the hammer with both hands at the same time.) The orangish-tan coloration
on it looks quite nice, and the light blue paint apps on the center and
the "spokes" makes it look like it's humming with power, again giving Magnus
another show-accurate detail. This all makes for a very nice-looking robot
mode that keeps looking admirably close to his show model-- however, in
vehicle mode this all falls apart. The biggest offenders here are his shoulders
which-- due to the transformation-- now simply are stuck as large odd protrusions
on the sides, and are incredibly unsightly. His robot chest halves also
don't even fold behind his cab section, sticking out further behind the
big shoulder protrusions. His hammer also doesn't fit anywhere out-of-sight,
thus making all those weapon &amp; robot extras in the back of the vehicle
mode that are inherent to this mode even MORE obvious. Ultra Magnus has
the same electronic features as Weaponizer Optimus (complete with the same
red light that shines on when his "Weaponizer" gatling guns are activated).

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "Platinum Edition" Ultra
Magnus has a supremely eye-catching color scheme, and the remolding done
looks incredible in robot mode-- the headsculpt and weapon in particular.
However, the vehicle mode is even MORE unsightly here than it is on Weaponizer
Optimus, mostly due to the big shoulder sections sticking out of the sides.
If you want a nice, big Ultra Magnus with a cool weapon and the best color
scheme, this is the version you want (so long as you can swallow the premium
price); but I wouldn't put in him vehicle mode much if I were you, as it's
a much better robot mode piece.

       Ultra Magnus is an inspiration to the
Autobots under his command, and a source of terror for the Decepticons
who fight against him. His ancient hammer-- a mighty artifact known as
the Forge of Solus-- is a symbol of the strength with which he defends
Autobot ideals. The thunderous strike of this incredible hammer has been
known to topple even the greatest Decepticon warriors.
