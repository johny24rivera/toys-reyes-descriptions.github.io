    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Sideswipe. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Sideswipe

     Dead End, the first Decepticon
Alternator, is just a remold of Sideswipe, but he's a pretty significant
remold. He's now a Dodge Viper Competition- no convertible this time around.
And I have to say, his vehicle mode is coolest one of the Alternators that
I've seen so far (as of 9/04), and that's saying a LOT. No extras at all,
just like on Sideswipe, but geez- that black-with-silver-stripes looks
SO good on this sportscar. And the red-tinted windows just add to Dead
End's eeeevilness. As for the design of the car itself, pretty much every
part on Dead End that is involved in the vehicle mode has been remolded
to some extent. He's not got a hood (obviously), a "tail fin", and the
very bottom of his car mode has been thickened up a bit. So he's basically
a completely new toy in this mode.

     In robot mode, however,
he still retains pretty much every design flaw that Sideswipe had. Granted,
he still looks cooler, but that's mostly because of his awesome color scheme.
He also adds one problem, oddly enough- his chest doesn't really clip together
because of its new construction, and although it doesn't exactly swing
around when you play with him, it doesn't always stay in the same place,
either. Probably the oddest thing Dead End has going for him, though, is
that if you ignore the colors, he has G1 Sunstreaker's FACE. Down to the
finest detail. I'm guessing that this mold was originally supposed to be
Sunstreaker, but when Hasbro saw all the demand for Decepticon Alternators,
they quickly redid the paint job and gave him a new allegiance symbol.
Not that I don't appreciate a Decepticon Alternator, but c'mon... it's
just so obviously Sunstreaker, man. So in my world, Alternator Dead End
is an evil clone of Sunstreaker. Unoriginal? Maybe, but I'm lazy.

     Alternator Dead End
has a vehicle mode that you will absolutely drool over, and a freaking
awesome color scheme. His robot mode still suffers from the same oddities
as Sideswipe, however, and he has Sunstreaker's head. So although he's
not the greatest Alternator overall, he has the greatest VEHICLE mode of
the bunch, and that's worth picking him up right there. I mean, geez....
it's so SWEET... I want a car like THAT. (Hey, I can dream, can't I?)
