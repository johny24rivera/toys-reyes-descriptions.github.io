    Spider-Man's vehicle
mode is a motorcycle-- which fits a little, I suppose, though you'd think
living in Manhattan he'd get around fast web-slinging everywhere anyways.
Regardless, this mode is pretty well-done, with proportions that are quite
good, and there's no robot mode extras. (The robot chest is blatantly obvious
in the middle of this mode, but it fits in with the overall shape of the
motorcycle, so I don't techncially count that as an extra.) Using the web-slinging
missiles from robot mode as exhaust pipes in this mode is pretty darned
creative, and the front part looks pretty cool, being reminiscient of Spider-Man's
head but not overly so to the point where it looks like a motorcycle with
Spider-Man's noggin on the front. As for his stability, nothing to worry
about here-- he has two little pieces that fold out from his bottom side
to keep him from falling over in this mode. The blue-and-red colors, while
definitely true to Spider-Man's classic costume, don't work particularly
well for a motorcycle, however, which is probably my only major complaint
about this mode.

    Spider-Man's robot mode
isn't quite as good as his vehicle mode, but it still definitely has its
upsides. For one, the proportions are nearly perfect compared to the "real"
Spider-Man, and he's got some excellent detailing, like the tubes on the
insides of hips and all the web-like detailing all over his body. I also
like how his hands are both molded in the "getting ready to shoot webbing"
position, since his spring-loaded missile launchers are both located on
his hands, and meant to be shots of webbing. The detailing on his head
is also very well-done-- it's definitely close to the actual Spider-Man's
head, but with some extra mechanical detailing like the silver square on
his forehead and the metallic gray webbing patterns stretching behind his
eyes-- er, optics. Spider-Man's transformation is, more or less, the same
as

    , so in terms of vehicle mode
extras my comments are mostly the same in that respect. The tires on the
shoulders are pretty blatant extras, but the wheel and windshield fit up
against his back and mesh with his overall form pretty well. However, the
joint that holds up the wheel &amp; windshield to the back is rather floppy,
and there's nothing for that whole assembly to peg into, which is probably
my second biggest problem with this mode. My BIGGEST problem with this
mode are Spider-Man's overly blocky and stiff arms-- he has fine ball-joint
articulation when it comes the shoulders, but his elbows have somewhat
limited movement, with both the upper and lower arms being so blocky, so
he can't exactly aim his web blasters in just any direction. His articulation
on his legs is also a tad stiff-- he can move at the ankles, knees, two
places at the hips, but at only one direction (back-and-forth) at each
place. His neck can also turn, and his waist technically can turn, though
you have to move around the assembly on Spider-Man's back if you want to
do so. He CAN look up and down at the stomach, though, which is pretty
unexpected and a cool point of movement.

    Spider-Man has a pretty
cool vehicle mode and a decent, if not outstanding, robot mode (it has
some kibble and articulation problems). I'd mildly recommend him.

      Capable of phenomenal acceleration,
and maneuverable enough to weave through traffic as easily as Spider-Man
himself dodges bullets, his motorcycle mode is the ultimate extension of
his style. In mech mode, it duplicates his powers almost perfectly, with
powerful electromagnets that allow wall-crawling, and missile launchers
that fire explosive blasts of webbing strong enough to entangle even the
most powerful machine opponent.
