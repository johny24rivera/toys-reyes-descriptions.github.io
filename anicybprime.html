    Optimus Prime's pre-Earth
mode is something that heavily resembles a futuristic truck, only... more
futuristic, and with treads in the back instead of normal wheels. (Speaking
of which, that's a rather interesting combination, having wheels in the
front and treads in the back...) Unlike many other "futuristic" vehicle
modes, however, which often just mean the vehicle mode doesn't have to
look like anything but the robot mode twisted into an odd position, this
mode actually looks like an plausible alternate mode. With the exception
of the obvious robot feet sticking out the back end-- which is a problem
a lot of Optimus Prime toys share-- and the obvious axe, there's no real
robot extras in this mode. A few touches, like the horizontal "smokestacks"
on the sides of the car and the "windshield", really help to add to its
plausibility. The color scheme is classic Prime-- red, gray/silver, and
blue, with a bit of yellow, so no differences here. Optimus Prime also
has a fair number of paint apps, though like the Animated style, they're
simply applied and easy to pick out. Everything also pegs together pretty
solidly, so no worries there.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is simply a product of quite amazing engineering. Everything folds
away and into his general humanoid form amazing well-- it looks like it's
just your typical "pop up the head and bring down the legs" Prime transformation,
but it's got a couple of unique twists, particularly when it comes to the
chest. Oh, and enclosing the wheels within the shoulders? Genius. He has
pretty much perfect proportions (accounting for the slightly exaggerated
Animated proportions, of course), and his articulation is phenomenal--
he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), waist, hips, knees (at two points), and ankles. And, given
that he has no real vehicle kibble to speak of, you can get him into a
TON of cool poses. The smokestack pieces on the sides of his lower arms
can also rotate in place to become impromptu "guns" if you so wish. Prime's
face sculpt is spot-on when comapred to the show, though he doesn't have
a faceplate that can be slid up at this scale. Optimus Prime's weapons
are fairly cool, though they're not the best out of all the Animated Prime
toys-- his axe is pretty wimpy compared to how large it is in the actual
show, though the top of the vehicle mode makes for a fair-looking shield.
What IS cool about the axe, however, is that it essentially has three different
modes-- the first is a single-bladed axe, the second is a double-bladed
axe (which involves simply folding out one of the blade pieces to the other
side), and the third is a "super" double-bladed axe, which involves extending
and sliding the shield over the axe blades. This last mode looks rather
odd, though, given that the axe blades don't even LOOK sharp.

    Cybertron Mode Prime
is probably my favorite version of Animated Prime overall, with a superb
robot mode and a pretty good (and plausible) futuristic vehicle mode, as
well. His weapons are the only thing about him that falls a little flat.
Highly recommended.

      Despite having washed out of the Autobot
Academy, Optimus Prime is a natural leader. Trained to lead the bravest
of the brave into battle against overwhelming odds, he eagerly looked forward
to his first assignment. It's just too bad the Decepticons were defeated
ages ago, and the only crews left to lead are the maintenance squads that
keep the Space Bridge network running. Since his assignment, he's lost
track of his ambitions. The last thing he expects is the chance to test
his leadership abilities in a battle to defend his home and fight for freedom.
