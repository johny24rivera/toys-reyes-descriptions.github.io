     Yeah, okay, this isn't much of a review.
But that's because this "exclusive" is just two previous Transformers toys
repackaged. The Ultra Magnus is the exact same as his Sam's Club Universe
version, to check out that review
     <a href="uniprimemagnus.html">

     </a>
     .
The Optimus Prime is the same as his Robots in Disguise version, but with
a black sash, woo, THAT'S certainly worth buying another one. See the review
of his RiD toy
     <a href="ridprime.html">
      here
     </a>
     . Nicely-priced package
if you don't have either of these toys, but if you do, then this is definitely
a big pass. No meaningful changes at all to the set.
