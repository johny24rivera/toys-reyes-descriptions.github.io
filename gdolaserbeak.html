    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Skystalker.

     Laserbeak may not look
like at first, but he's meant to be an homage to the
     <a href="g1soundwave.html">
      G1
bird-cassette
     </a>
     Soundwave minion of the same name. This homage certainly...
stretches it, though. The most obvious callback to Laserbeak is the color
scheme-- particularly the painted silver-and-red apps on the wings, which
adds up to a surprisingly amount of paint on the toy. The general color
scheme is pretty basic-- being silver, red, and black-- but they contrast
against each other well and make for a fairly solid scheme. There's also
a bit of pale gold on Laserbeak's robot head, to mimic the gold eyes on
the G1 toy. I do wish that the two shades of gray plastic mostly seen in
Laserbeak's robot mode were of a more metallic shade-- unfortunately, they're
both the standard blah shades of the color, and make certain robot parts--
the feet, in particular-- bland. Laserbeak's red paint also doesn't quite
match up with his red plastic, with the plastic being a noticeably duller,
paler shade than the paint. It's not SUPER noticeable, but it catches the
eye in an unflattering way when the two different shades of red are right
next to each other, such as down the midsection of the vehicle mode. As
for the homage itself-- people tend to think it's either an incredibly
awesome idea or an incredibly lame one. I tend to lean towards the latter.
Yes, this mode has a "gerwalk" mode where you can extend the robot leg
sections in vehicle mode, and the legs are bird-like-- and yes, the alt
mode is a flying alt mode. But other than that? I just don't see it. It
just doesn't share enough features with any previous form of Laserbeak
to really work, and since it's clearly not a new character with the same
name, I felt they could have done a lot of other, more fitting things with
a redeco of this mold.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "GDO" Laserbeak has
a basic but pretty nice color scheme, and plenty of paint apps to round
things out and keep things visually interesting. I wish he had a little
less gray plastic in robot mode, but that's about my only complaint color-wise.
It's also a great mold, and one that I would highly recommend purchasing
if you don't have already-- however, when looked at not just by itself
but as a Laserbeak toy, it falls flat, not feeling evocative enough of
the character outside of the wing paint apps and MAYBE the feet to really
fit the bill. It's best repurposed as some new character if you want to
add the toy to your personal collection.

       Laserbeak rarely speaks. He relies on
his silence, and his high-powered lasers, to terrify the victims of his
interrogations. No one who falls under his ruthless control escapes unscathed--
more than one Autobot has emerged from captivity with a terrible tale to
tell.
