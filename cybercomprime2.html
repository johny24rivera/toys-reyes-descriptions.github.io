    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cyber Commander
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Cyber Commander Optimus Prime

     A redeco of the Cyber
Commander Optimus Prime mold was released for Western markets, compared
to the mostly Asia-exclusive original version, and this one has a bit more
of a movie-inspired color scheme. The red and blue main colors used on
him are both noticeably darker than the red and blue on the original version,
but also a bit richer-looking and bolder, too. The transparent blue plastic
has gone through the opposite change, being lighter and paler. For the
overall palette, though, the most obvious change is the addition of gray
on the arms. His upper arms and fists are a darker gray, while his lower
arms are that very bland, light milky shade of the plastic. There's also
some more of that light milky gray on the robot abs, and more of the darker
gray on his feet, upper legs, and waist. I do prefer the red and blue in
general over gray-- and that's certainly the case for the light bland milky
gray, mostly visible on those lower arms-- but given how much the red and
blue are still used here quite well, and in better shades than on the original,
using some gray to help give him a bit more color differentation is okay,
I suppose. There is some red paint on his lower arms, at least, though
the silver paint on the lower legs has been removed compared to the original.
There's some movie Prime-esque basic "flame" details on the sides of the
front of the truck mode, though they're used nowhere else on the figure.
The hips/upper legs, as opposed to being covered in silver paint this go-around,
are now mostly gray, with some blue on the ratchets and some of the side
details. The smokestack and front bumper painted details are the same,
as are the Autobot symbol stickers used on the shoulders. The head is painted
slightly differently, with the side vents painted silver, but not the forehead
vent (the mouthplate is still kept silver on this version).

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Cyber Commander Optimus Prime.

     The 2nd version of Cyber
Commander Optimus Prime is still certainly decoed as an Optimus Prime toy,
but with noticeably richer red and blue, and with slightly more variance
in paint apps. This is partially negated by the addition of some more gray--
particularly on the arms, which I dislike-- but overall, I would rate this
toy just a titch higher than the original Cyber Commander's paint job.
That said, unless you're a Prime completist, this version is still within
the overall "color ballpark" of the original, so if you have the 1.0 version
you can skip this toy.
