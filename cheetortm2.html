    Beast Mode is a seriously
mutated cheetah. Although not as sleek as
    <a href="cheetortm.html">
     Cheetor

    , he gave up that for a meaner appearance. He looks almost
rabid, with pieces of metal sticking out of his fur here and there, a hunch
on his back, with a very long tail and an extremely thin waist. He has
a missle launcher, though, and is one of the few Beast Wars Transformers
that can fire its weapons while in Beast mode.

    His robot mode is somewhat
disappointing, though. Its legs cannot straighten out much, and there is
a noticeable gap between the back of his robot head and the starting of
his "hunchback". This mode is very mean-looking and I just cant picture
Cheetors voice coming out of it. The detailing is very nice, though. The
spark orb is located under a panel on his left leg.

    A basically good toy,
although the robot mode could have been better.

      Cheetor is experiencing some unusual
growing pains. The lines between beast and robot have blurred, creating
a new Cheetor even faster and more ferocious than ever before. But he must
learn to control his new capabilities - instead of being controlled by
them. Outfitted with a new high-powered missile launcher and leap-thruster,
the new ultra-strong and somewhat unpredictable Cheetor strikes fear into
the circuits of all Predacons he encounters.
