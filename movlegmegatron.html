    Megatron's futuristic
aircraft alternate mode is, surprisingly enough, the best-looking alternate
mode out of any of the Movie Megatrons. There's no bunch of robot mode
kibble underneath the wings or the rear section, the the wings are much
better-proportioned (read: larger) than they are on the larger versions
of Megatron. The robot head is still a little obvious, however, sticking
up backwards from the main body of this mode, and the robot hands are rather
obvious, serving as the "side nosecones" of the mode. The color scheme
of gray and black is also really dull, even if the few bits of bronze and
silver do spice it up a little (particularly in robot mode). The mold detailing
is VERY good, however, especially on the bits that are utilized in robot
mode. It never ceases to amaze me how much detail they can cram in on even
these small toys...

    As a side effect of
having the best vehicle mode, Legends Megatron has the worst robot mode
out of the Movie Megatron toys, though it's still rather good for its size.
He's a bit of a hunchback, as his middle nosecone from vehicle mode just
folds behind his back for this mode. His legs are his biggest weak point
in this mode, though-- they're made up of the vehicle mode wings, so they
look pretty flat proportionally, and the large feet look a tad dopey compared
to Megatron's otherwise frightening visage. Otherwise his proportions are
great for a toy of its size, though, and the paint and mold detailing ont
he chest, face, and arms really make the figure in this mode. As expected
for a Legend-class toy, his articulation is rather limited-- he can move
at the head, shoulders, waist, and hips, but that's it. Luckily, most of
these joints are ball joints, so he can move a bit more than the average
toy of this size.

    Legends class Megatron
is one of the best Movie Legends toys, with easily the best-looking vehicle
mode of all the Megatron toys and a robot mode that, although not great,
isn't that bad for a toy of this size, either. If you tend to like little
toys like this, then by all means purchase this sucker.
