    Jetfire's vehicle mode
is pretty accurate to the
    <a href="cyjetfire.html">
     larger "official" version,
    </a>
    and the amount of mold detailing is actually pretty good, especially for
a Happy Meal toy. I'm not sure why they decided to make the front part
light green and the rest of this mode dark green, as it really looks odd.
The robot fists are rather visible coming out of the turbines under the
wings, but that's unavoidable at this scale. What REALLY bugs em about
this mode is the complete lack of paint detailing-- none at all! C'mon,
I understand how miniscule of a budget these Kids' Meal toys get, but at
last but some paint on the windows for Primus' sake! Sigh...

    The robot mode... *snicker*...
is so bad it's downright hilarious. The legs are ridiculously skinny, the
front of the plane mode folds down so far it looks like a potbelly and
not an actual chest, and the head is way too small and looks like it's
about to drown in upper body. The only paint app is a blob of white on
his head, and oh yeah, the arms are stuck in the WEIRDEST position. Good
luck taking Jetfire seriously in this mode.

    Kids' Meal Jetfire may
look reasonably good in his vehicle mode (if it weren't for the complete
lack of paint detailing), but his robot mode is an absolute joke. Stay
away, even if you're a completist. It's just not worth it.
