    Bumblebee's alternate
mode looks like something out of TRON. It's very aerodynamic and futuristic-looking--
and basically a sleek spread-out bubble on wheels. It works remarkably
well as a "pre-Earth" alt mode for the guy, and with the primarily yellow-and-black
coloration you can practically see his future car mode given a wink-wink-nudge-nudge
here. The bright red lines down the windows are really nice details, though
having the tires interlaced with transparent red plastic is definitely
my favorite detail about this mode-- it just looks so cool. Unfortunately,
the transparent plastic used for Bumblebee's windows aren't dark enough
where you can't see the folded-up arms behind them, which is a bit of a
bummer. Other than that there aren't any robot mode extras in this mode,
however, and it's very accurate to the
    <a href="wfcps3.html">
     War for Cybertron
    </a>
    video game. The mold detailing is admittedly sparse here, but this is on
purpose, to help give Bumblebee the extremely sleek, futuristic look he
has here.

    In robot mode Bumblebee
is also remarkably similiar to how he looks in the video game-- a fairly
remarkable feat given that the designs didn't seen to initially be made
to turn into physical toys. His proportions are spot-on, and he's got pretty
much the quintessential Bumblebee look and color scheme. Although he's
meant to be the same charcter as Prime Bumblebee, this guy's head is definitely
a pretty faithful recreation of his G1 design, with a few extra added details
on the cheeks and sides to "mech him up" a little more. I particularly
love the way his legs transform AROUND his wheels into pretty awesome-looking
feet. His arms are generally okay, but the headlight pieces hanging off
the forearms don't really clip into place, so they tend to flop around
too easily, unfortunately. He does have a spring-loaded flip-out transparent
switchblade housed in each forearm, which is a cool gimmick. however. He
also has a standard (non-firing) blaster that he can hold in his arms.
The main body is done fairly well, but here's where Bumblebee has his biggest
downside-- he's a pretty big shell former. Pretty much the entire upper
two-thirds of his vehicle mode is collapsed together on his back. Granted,
it collapses together into a remarkably small space, but it still definitely
sticks out a bit, and is what keep him from being completely game-accurate
in this mode. Additionally, as much as I like the light red lines when
they're used as small paint apps against Bumblebee's black plastic &amp;
paint apps, using it on a large area near his waist makes it clear it's
a rather obnoxious color when used in anything more than tiny amounts--
the
bright pinkish red against Bumblebee's yellow is a bit of eyesore, there,
in what is otherwise a solid (if not astounding) color scheme. The silver
paint apps also help to bring a bit more color variety, though they don't
contrast against the yellow as much as I'd like. As for articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at three points), elbows
(at two points), wrists, waist, hips (at three points), and knees (at two
points). So he's got pretty much all the major points covered-- but the
waist and hip movement tend to be restricted a bit due to the bit vehicle
shell he's got on his back. One additional note-- Bumblebee's transformation
to robot mode is fairly simple and straightforward, but getting him back
into vehicle mode is a bit of a challenge, given that he's got one of those
transformations where everything has to click together just right, and
everything's pretty compressed in there in his alt mode. Additionally,
his legs can come un-pegged near the knees somewhat easily, which can add
a little to the frustration.

    Cybertronian Bumblebee
is a pretty darn nice-looking design in both modes, with his proportions
and general aesthetic being his strongest points. His somewhat difficult
transformation to vehicle mode and his large amount of vehicle kibble on
his back in robot mode are fairly significant drawbacks, but thankfully
they're about it when it comes to this toy. If you like futuristic alt
modes and don't mind a transformation that requires some finesse, I'd mildly
recommend him-- with the caveat that the other color schemes this mold
has gotten are a bit more attractive.

      Before he was the silent warrior he
is today, Bumblebee was a nonstop chatterbox, charged with carrying the
most vital Autobot communications. He was a fearless infiltrator of enemy
lines who stuck to the shadows and faded into the background despite his
bright yellow armor. His spirit was unbreakable and his friendly humor
was invaluable during the first dark days of the war.
