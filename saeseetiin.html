    Saesee Tiin's vehicle
mode is an Episode II Jedi Starfighter, complete with the interstellar
ring attachment on the front. Overall, this mode looks pretty good in most
respects. The proportions are pretty spot-on, with the exception of the
ring, which should be a bit bigger. Still, given how that would add even
MORE kibble to Saesee's Mech mode, I'm glad they made a bit smaller for
the purposes of this toy. The toy's mold and paint detailing is also superb--
the Star Wars Transformers have never skimped out on that department, and
they aren't about to start now. The colors, though accurate to the movie
I'm guessing (I'm not familiar with Saesee Tiin, so I'm not certain), are
really loud, though. There's a little bit of black, but otherwise the toy
is all very light colors that don't contrast particularly well. It catches
your eye, sure, but in a bad way. The ring-mounted launchers each fire
a lightsaber-missile, and the ring can detach from the core ship. The core
ship has its own set of fold-out landing gear, but sadly there's no landing
gear that works when the ship's connected to the ring, which is kind of
a bummer since it sits at a rather odd angle in that configuration. There
are no Mech mode extras in this mode at all, though it you look at the
toy from the underside you can see where the arms are, but that's nothing.
As with all Star Wars Transformers, the toy comes with miniature Saesee
Tiin figurine that fits snugly inside the cockpit.

    The first word that
comes to mind when looking at Saesee Tiin's Mech mode is "kibble". The
dude's PACKED with it, having more of it than any other SWTF except for
perhaps the X-Wing

    . He's
got this enormous backpack made up of pretty much his entire vehicle mode,
and it's so big it requires one of the ring halves to act as a third "foot"
to stabilize the toy. The moving of the missile launchers to over the sides
of the arms is pretty cool, but otherwise it's really unsightly and detracts
a bit from the core robot. Which is a shame, since the core robot itself
is pretty darned cool. The proportions are spot-on, and Saesee's got great
articulation-- he can move at every major point, including the waist. And,
given his aforementioned third "foot" for added stability, this means you
can get him into a lot of nifty poses. You can take the backpack off and
put it elsewhere, but this makes the other kibble attached to the core
robot rather loose and it swings about a lot, not to mention he's not nearly
as stable without that third "foot". I'm not too fond of the face, either--
it's a replica of Saesee Tiin's, but with a little mecha detailing added,
but not enough-- it still looks far too organic, maybe adding a faceplate
or something would've helped. The flip-down mask is pretty cool and a fitting
combat feature, though the detailing on it is rather uneven-- the black
"eye slits" detailed on the mask are definitely smaller on the left side
than on the right, and it makes the detailing on it look rather amateurish.

    Saesee Tiin has some
great articulation and proportions in robot mode, as well as an excellent
vehicle mode, but he's got a TON of kibble and a pretty darned loud color
scheme. It's up to you on whether to get it or not, depending on what you
feel most strongly about in a Transformer.
