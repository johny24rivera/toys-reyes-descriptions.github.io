    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Mirage. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Mirage

     Well, if Rodimus was
destined to be a repaint, it's certainly appropriate that he'd be repainted
from a Ford GT, one of the slickest-looking Alternators all-around. The
light red with flames works with a sportscar, and the dark red-- almost
entirely visible in robot mode-- provides a fairly good contrast color
in addition to the black so that's he's not ENTIRELY light-colored. Using
gold for most of the flames was defintiely a nice touch, particularly in
robot mode where the flame design is pretty much identical to
     <a href="rodimusmajor.html">
      Rodimus'
G1 toy
     </a>
     . Unfortunately, in vehicle mode the flames look a bit more "broken
up" on the roof to achieve this look. Another detail I'm really fond of
is the "flames" surrounding Rodimus' lower arms-- I mean, I don't care
who you are, that's just cool. I'm really not fond of the bright yellow
used on far too much of the figure, though, as it's definitely a few shades
too loud.

     Rodimus' head has been
changed for this figure, though it looks like Rodimus about as much as
Alternator Mirage looks like G1 Rodimus-- that is, only peripherally. It
still is a pretty cool head design, though, and his visor can flip up,
which is a pretty cool detail.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Alternator Rodimus is
a nice homage to the G1 character, and though the flames are cool (particularly
on his lower arms), I think his color scheme is a bit loud compared to
Mirage's. As such, I'd recommend Mirage over this guy, not just because
of the cheaper price but because of the overall toy as well. Still, if
you're a fan of the character, the mold, or Alternators in general, it's
definitely a fine toy worth picking up.
