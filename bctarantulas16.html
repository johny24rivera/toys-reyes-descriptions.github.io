     This version of "vehicle
Tarantulas" is based on his
     <a href="tarantulastm.html">
      Transmetal version
     </a>
     because... well... FunPub already released a "pre-BW" version of Tarantulas,
in its 3rd subscription service. This version forgoes the more fitting
motorcycle alt mode for a rather ill-fitting armored transport alt mode
for Tarantulas. For the most part it doesn't work for the character, except
for one thing-- I love love LOVE how the windows, headlights, and a few
other minor bits on the shoulders and robot chest and waist are painted
a wonderful bright green. Particularly in vehicle mode, this calls back
to the Transmetal version's spider eyes, and it also just contrasts wonderfully
as an accent color. However, the bulkiness of the vehicle mode and the
robot mode bring to mind the
     <a href="tarantulas.html">
      original version
     </a>
     of Tarantulas a little more than his Transmetal version-- even then, though,
the original Tarantulas had a bulky chest and wide shoulders, not bulky
legs and arms. This is just another instance of the mold (largely) ill-fitting
the character because Hasbro made FunPub fit their Beast Wars theme into
Combiner Wars molds. Still, FunPub did a dynamite job with the color scheme
on this one-- much of the dark plastic in vehicle mode is actually a very
dark blue, not black-- just like on the Transmetal toy, though there is
certainly a fair amount of black plastic (not just on the tires, but on
the knees, upper legs, chest, and a few other minor connector parts in
robot mode. Another fairly dark color-- though certainly lighter than the
dark blue and black-- is some dark purple, on the sides of the vehicle
mode as well as on the lower robot arms, lower chest, lower legs, and some
minor connector parts. The purple plastic is noticeably paler than the
paint, though the former is used so sparingly it's not a big issue. Beyond
the aforementioned bright green, the pumpkin orange on the toes and shoulders
is another great accent color that contributes to Tarantulas' "Halloween-y"
colors.

     Tarantulas has a new
headsculpt, obviously inspired by his Transmetal head but a bit "chunkier"
to fit his proportions. His little side horns have sadly been shortened
due to space restrictions in vehicle mode, but otherwise all the major
details are there-- the mandibles are particularly well-done. He's got
all the paint you'd expect, too, like a yellow visor, green "jewels" on
his forehead, orange-and-purple mandibles, and, oddly, a bit of dark purplish
periwinkle around his eyes and on the sides. I'm not sure why that color's
there-- it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb, but it wasn't on the Transmetal
toy either. Still, a well-painted headsculpt, to be sure. No other mold
changes have been made to Tarantulas when compared to CW Rook.

     BotCon 2016 Tarantulas
has an excellent color scheme and a decent headsculpt-- FunPub certainly
did their level best to make this mold look as much like Transmetal Tarantulas
as possible (and the window "eyes" are a brilliant touch), but the mold
just doesn't fit Tarantulas well in nearly every respect. I'd recommend
the Subscription Service version of pre-BW Tarantulas before this one any
day, though on the other hand I do think this is the best-looking toy (and
best mold) out of the 2016 boxset.

       Crawling up from a pit of the unknown,
the Secret Police member Predacon Tarantulas is really one of the Tripredacus
Council's covert agents. He has been working with them longer than even
the logs of the Great Wars can remember. A mind as brilliant as it is twisted,
Predacon Tarantulas is a key member of the Council's large-scale plans
and instrumental in the creation of the combiner technology they currently
desire. There have been rumblings that he will soon be assigned a major
covert mission within the ranks of Predacon rogues to further flesh out
the needs of the Tripredacus Elders.

       Predacon Tarantulas wields a unique
weapon which injects a cyber-toxin straight into a Cybertronian's spark

feeling he must one-up the offensive creation of his Councilmen superiors
as to maintain his reputation as an elite scientist within their ranks.
