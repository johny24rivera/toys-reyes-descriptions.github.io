    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Masterpiece Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Masterpiece

     I'm honestly surprised
that they used an expensive exclusive "slot" on repaint of a character
that's best known for... well, being a Starscream repaint. Still, Skywarp
has always had an awesome color scheme, and the Masterpiece figure is certainly
not the exception to this rule. The black and silver go together particularly
well, and the purple serves as a nice secondary color. That's my main beef,
though (if you could call it a beef)-- for Skywarp, there's not enough
purple on the figure. Only a few minor parts in robot mode and his tailfins
are purple. I wish a bit more of his robot mode had been done up in this
nice shade of purple-- all that black makes him look a tad more boring
than he otherwise would have. I also miss all the extra paint weathering
and detailing that went into Masterpiece Starscream-- I know it's hard
to do black weathering on a primarily black figure, but some "worn metal"
silver apps or something really would've helped Skywarp look better next
to his Masterpiece "brother". The details that ARE there are done quite
well, though-- the stripes on the wings look like they came right off of
the
     <a href="g1skywarp.html">
      G1 figure
     </a>
     , and the little bits of red
and yellow used in robot mode really pop.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Masterpiece Skywarp-- unlike the Japanese release of the figure,
his "second face" still has Starscream's characteristic smirk, though it
works well enough on Skywarp that I really don't mind.

     Masterpiece Skywarp
is an excellent toy in excellent colors. He's missing some of the weathering
paint that really made Masterpiece Starscream look "realistic", but he's
still quite the sight to behold. Highly recommended if you don't mind complicated
transformations.

         As expected, Masterpiece
Starscream gets his usual repaint of Skywarp, which I am fine with. I love
this mold, and I love Skywarp's colors a LOT. Now the colors on this Skywarp
are more of the modern deco, with a deeper purple as opposed to the white-ish
purple that G1 Skywarp had. Not that I mind it, I like the more richer
purple than the old G1 purple anyhow. Other than the name SKYWARP printed
onto his base and some different paint apps, Skywarp is the same mold.
As I said earlier in my review of the original mold, I feel that the Dr.
Arkeville that fits in the cockpit should have been remolded into a pilot,
or maybe Spike (he was taken by Skywarp through a space gate with energon
cubes in the cartoon, so it makes sense). Other than that though, this
figure is about the same as Starscream. Though the details are a bit harder
to see on him because of the black, I much prefer his sleek colors and
it makes him more stealthy.

         Skywarp is the best
of the paint jobs this mold has gotten, and although he still has the flaws
of the origianl mold, I'd recommend him over Starscream.

            Skywarp appears once again, reproduced
in near-perfect detail. He is a cheap and dirty thug who takes simple joy
in catching friend and foe alike unaware. Though he's too lazy to be an
effective warrior without direct supervision, he puts immeasurable thought
into planning the pranks he pulls on whichever unfortunate target wanders
into his sensor net. He'd rather lounge around on the airstrip than fight,
but he's always ready to slash a few tires.
