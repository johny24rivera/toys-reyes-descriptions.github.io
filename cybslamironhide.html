    Ironhide's truck mode
is one of the most chibi-fied of all the Cyber Slammers, which is really
saying something. The front bumper is really short and squat, as is the
truck bed, and the windows don't rise very far about the main body of the
truck. The mold detailing is also somewhat sparse and has rounded edges.
Of course, all of this is sort of the point of the Cyber Slammers, so these
aren't negatives in the case of this toy. I am impressed with the amount
of paint detailing on the figure, though-- there's tons of highlight colors,
such as the light orange on the headlights, the red detailing on the GMC
logo, and the blue on the rooflights. It all comes together really well.
I particularly like the spray-painted "mud splatter" paint apps behind
the front tires.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Ironhide can be locked in truck mode by pushing the white tab on the bottom
of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Ironhide's robot body
into his vehicle mode, the truck will take off (providing he's on a flat
surface), and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode body will
pop back up again. Because of this gimmick, Ironhide doesn't really have
any lower body in robot mode, just most of his truck mode. His main body,
head, and arms are molded onto the underside of his truck mode roof and
doors. Still, the detailing on the robot parts is fairly good, with plenty
of movie-accurate detailing, particularly on the chest and abdomen. Two
negatives, however-- first, Ironhide's slightly messed-up right optic in
the movie is grossly overexaggerated on this toy, with it looking like
he has a black eye. Second, Because of the size of his doors, his lower
arms are way too small proportionally and rather stiff-looking, and the
guns on his lower arms, which are supposed to be one of his major features,
are barely visible. Like the other Cyber Slammers, Ironhide's articulation
is very limited-- his head can move from side to side and his arms can
move back-and-forth at the shoulders, though the shoulders snap back into
their default position once you let go of them.

    Cyber Slammer Ironhide
is about middle-of-the-road as far as Cyber Slammers go, with some great
paint detailing (particularly in vehicle mode) and some nice details, but
his arms are way too tiny in robot mode. Still, great for the young-uns.
