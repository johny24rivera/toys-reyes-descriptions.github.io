    Omega Prime, as stated
above, is a gestalt composed of the Super versions of
    <a href="ultramagnus.html">
     Ultra
Magnus
    </a>
    and
    <a href="ridprime.html">
     Optimus Prime
    </a>
    . It's sort of
a souped-up version of Optimus Prime's "super" robot mode, actually; Optimus
Prime's basic robot mode forms the main body, upon which parts of Ultra
Magnus, which have been transformed into armor, are attached. Visually,
this mode is very, very nice. There's details galore, and enough of a varied
color scheme to please even the pickiest of Transfans. The gold Autobot
symbol on his chest, along with its shiny silver and blue colors surrounding
it, is the most eye-catching part of this toy, and is very nicely done.
The extra flaps on the side of his large chest tend to stick out a bit,
though, which is why I prefer to fold them onto his chest rather than folded
out, as they are in the pictures above. He also stays together rather solidly
in this mode- the only armor parts that tend to come off a bit easier than
I'd like are his lower leg armor pieces, and that's only if you're picking
him up and leaving his feet dangling. There's also plenty of articulation-
just as much as they is in Optimus Prime's "super" robot mode, in fact,
and then some. The feet can move easily, as can the upper legs, knees,
elbows, thumbs, hands, head, and shoulders. However, this brings us to
Omega Prime's only, but major, downfall- he has articulation, but NOT posability.
Because he's so heavy, many of his joints simply don't hold him up that
well, or stay veyy well in their set position. The only real solid, stable
joints on Omega Prime are the ones in his upper legs. Because of this,
he's mostly stuck in one pose in this mode- the one shown above, a battle-ready
stance. He can't really kick or do any really cool movements with his arms
because he's so heavy. And this really subtracts from the enjoyment of
an otherwise cool toy.

    So, in review, Omega
Prime is near-perfect in every area except his posability. Although it's
his only major downfall, it's pretty noticeable, which is why I can't recommend
him that much to those who like to pose their toys in cool positions.
