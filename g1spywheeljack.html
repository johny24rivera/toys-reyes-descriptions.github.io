    Mold History
   </b>
   : Wheeljack's mold was
originally planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers: Generation
2, but it never went through. The mold was finally released as Daytonus
for RiD, though, and now it's been repainted as Wheeljack!

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Daytonus. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Daytonus

     Wheeljack's vehicle mode
is almost spot-on with his G1 vehicle mode, both in color scheme and structure.
He actually still has the same "silver-rimmed black flowing stripes" paint
apps that his predecessor Daytonus had, but the base color of the car has
been changed, and additional stickers have been added, so I don't mind
it too much. The stickers are various green and red patterns which closely
resemble the patterns on G1 Wheeljack. They really work very nicely with
the other various colors, and really catch the eye. Wheeljack also has
"539" stickers on both of his doors, which, of course, is another throwback
to his G1 self. In robot mode, he gains an additional color, dark blue-gray,
but this more of side effect of the colors of the other G1 Spychangers,
since they're batch-molded. It still goes pretty nicely with the white
and black, though. Of course, Wheeljack's robot mode doesn't resemble his
G1 counterpart's at all, but it's a repaint of a toy that wasn't intended
to be a homage, so what can you do?

     Wheeljack has a really
nice color scheme, especially in his vehicle mode, even if he does share
some of the paint apps with Daytonus. The white and the green-and-red stickers
also look a bit better on this mold than the "cheese yellow" of Daytonus,
which is why I'd recommend Wheeljack over Daytonus, even at the slightly-inflated
KB price of $4 U.S.
