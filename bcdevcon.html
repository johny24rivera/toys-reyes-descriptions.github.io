    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Generations
Scourge. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     At long last, Devcon--
who had previously only appeared on the original G1 TV show-- gets a toy!
In the show he transformed into a rather wide-winged spacecraft, so using
the Generations Scourge mold as a base works surprisingly well. As was
the case in the show, Devcon's color scheme is pretty patriotic (well,
if you're an American, of course)-- he's got a good amount of a moderately
dull blue and moderately dark red, with some white making an appearance
(particularly in robot mode) to help break up the dull colors. The white
itself contrasts excellently, but by themselves, the blue and red don't
really excite me that much, show-accurate or no; either the red or blue
should have been a bit lighter, methinks, to help his two most prominent
colors pop a bit more. This is particularly evident in vehicle mode, where
it's almost entirely blue surrounded by a "ring" of red at the edges of
the mode. Some other paint apps should have been included on the wings
or something, at least, to spice up the mode more-- Devcon IS oddly missing
his Cybertronian Knight symbols despite him being a Knight in the story,
why not put them on his wings? In robot mode thankfully the white usage
on his chest, upper legs, upper arms, and some other minor bits help him
look much more eye-catching, particularly the way everything is situated
on the chest. To add a bit more to his scheme, Devcon also has a bit of
yellow on his kneecaps and shoulders, along with the appropriate silver
paint on his face and sky blue eyes.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Devcon does have a mold
change, and that's a new facesculpt. Given the transformation and the gun
on the top of his head in robot mode in the cartoon, it's only appropriate
that that's been reproduced here, with the gun forming a "rear blaster"
in vehicle mode. Generally the new head looks quite good, but there's something
     <i>
      slightly
     </i>
     off about it. From a side view, everything looks awesome, but from a front
view his chin looks a bit Jay Leno-ish. Otherwise, it's a good sculpt.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     BotCon Devcon is very
much appreciated in that we FINALLY got a toy of this character, and the
mold suits him fairly well, with a (mostly) good new headsculpt. His colors
are generally accurate, but particularly in vehicle mode could've used
a bit more variety and "pop". I find him roughly middle-of-the-road as
far as the boxset exclusives go.

       After leaving the Wreckers due to a
lack of action in this new peacetime era (and disagreements on "questionable
methods" of interrogation), Devcon finds himself a loner and without a
sense of peace. He prefers the seclusion of a lone-wolf lifestyle, as it
allows him to focus on the task at hand, and not fall prey to the distractions
of attachment or sentiment. This reputation as a "bot who gets the job
done" has caught the attention of Knight Alpha Trizer, who sees the potential
for such a resource on his team of Knights and the potential to reshape
this aggression into a fine edge.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Working as a bounty hunter, Devcon tracks
down thugs and criminals around the galaxy and brings them back to Cybertron
for judgment. However, one such criminal has eluded him on countless occasions:
the mercenary Flamewar. Devcon is constantly lagging behind his prey, always
showing up after Flamewar has committed her latest robbery or assassination.
If that wasn't enough, Flamewar knows it and taunts him at every opportunity.
When approached by Alpha Trizer to join the Knights of Cybertron, Devcon
had only one demand before accepting the rank of Knight Sergeant: everyone
stays out of his way when it comes to apprehending his nemesis.
