    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Hound. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Hound

     Swindle is still a Jeep
Wrangler, just like Hound, but a few mold changes have been made to help
differentiate the two. The tires in vehicle mode are even bigger on Swindle
than on Hound, so you really get the feeling that Swindle can cross mountains
if he wanted to with those honkers. He also has an extra grill across his
front, which helps to give off the "even tougher than Hound" look. Like
on all Alternator remolds, the robot head has also been completely changed.
Like on
     <a href="altdeadend.html">
      Alternator Dead End
     </a>
     , it looks like
Swindle's head was originally supposed to be another Autobot character's--
in this case, Trailbreaker's. However, UNlike on Dead End, Trailbreaker's
head is close enough in design to G1 Swindle's that you can ignore the
minor differences in the overall structure. As for the color scheme, yellow
and black isn't BAD, but I think that Hound's metallic dark green is just
a lot more fitting for a rough-n-tumble vehicle than yellow. But at least
the yellow's a dull yellow, and not a really bright one. There's also several
secondary colors on Swindle that help to complement these two main colors,
such as purple and silver. Plus, purple helps to make Swindle look a little
more Decepticon-y in appearance.

     Swindle is a pretty
good remold-- I like the head design, the grill, and the larger tires.
But dull yellow just doesn't look as good as Hound's green did-- so I'd
have to recommend Hound over this guy.
