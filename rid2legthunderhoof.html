    Thunderhoof's unique
tractor alt mode is replicated fairly faithfully for this tiny version,
at least overall. Proportionally everything's pretty good, though the rear
cockpit section is perhaps a BIT too long. The biggest issue with this
mode, though, is definitely the lower robot arms, which are just right
there in between the wheels on each side. I mean, there's not even an attempt
to hide them. If you want to get picky, the front section of the main body
of the tractor-- when looked at from the top-- has some small gaps in the
side, due to the fact that it becomes the body of the robot mode, but that's
pretty minor. The mold detailing is pretty average for RID2015, with some
fairly minimal mold detailing outside of the "necessities", but there are
a few extra angular details on the top of the cockpit portion of the tractor.
On the back end there's an outline of the rear window and just a TAD of
rear bumper detailing, but it's not that impressive and is unpainted anyways.
Thunderhoof's color scheme of dark blue and black is kept faithfully on
this toy-- at least as much as you can reasonably expect on a Legion-class
toy. The dark blue is a pretty good shade, with a milky look to it that
looks pretty good on this shade, for a reason I can't completely explain.
There's also black on the tires and front harvester section, though there's
more of it "behind the scenes" as it were-- it's also used for Thunderhoof's
entire back (not readily visible in either mode from your average angle)
and on the robot upper legs. There's also some black paint on the front
windows and the front-side windows, but not on the back or back-side windows.
There's some silver on the rims above the wheels-- which looks pretty nice
against the other darker colors-- and some fairly light blue on the top
of the cockpit section. The light blue I wish was a bit lighter, though,
for some better contrast.

    Thunderhoof's transformation
is very simple-- just basically turn the front harvester section around
to reveal the head, separate out the arms from the sides, and the legs
separate and lengthen a bit from the back section. Basically this is the
tractor mode standing up on its end and extended out for the most part,
so from a detailing perspective there isn't much new revealed in this mode--
thus, compared to most robot modes, I don't have much to say about it because
so many parts are the same. Proportionally he's great, no complaints there.
The black is more prevalent here, used on the upper legs, middle of the
chest, and the antlers. The headsculpt is pretty spot-on for Thunderhoof,
with a silver face and piercing red eyes. The antlers are nice, but it's
odd that there's new unique (smaller) antlers on the robot head but the
tractor harvester section-- which is SUPPOSED to be these antlers, hence
why they're on Thunderhoof's head-- is actually much larger behind them,
and doesn't fold away, so Thunderhoof basically has TWO sets of antlers,
just like on the 1-step. It's just really weird. For articulation, Thunderhoof
can move at the neck, shoulders, hips, and knees-- and the shoulders and
hips are on ball joints, so he's pretty articulated for the size.

    Legion Thunderhoof is
a pretty decent representation of the character at such a small size, with
only some minor issues given the limitations of the small size-- such as
obvious arms in vehicle mode and two sets of antlers in robot mode. Otherwise
he's a solid addition to your tiny RID2015 lineup, though I wish the details
were a bit more different between his two modes.
