    Luke Skywalker's Mech
as the appropriate alt mode of an X-Wing fighter. The proportions for this
mode are pretty spot-on, as you'd expect from a Star Wars Transformer,
and the detailing is definitely accurate. I especially like how the paint
app decorations look "worn", as well as the faded gray spray apps near
the back, it makes it look like this X-Wing has been through its fair share
of battles. All four of the missile launchers (made of the wing-mounted
guns) are spring-loaded as well, a rarity for a Transformer of this size.
The miniature Luke figure also fits pretty well in his cockpit (though
you have to transfer him to the Mech chest cavity during transformation).
There are a few minor extra problems in this mode, though, something that's
all but nonexistent in the Star Wars Transformers line. For one, the lightsaber
on the underside of the vehicle mode sticks out a bit and is somewhat apparent,
and the hook that holds it in place doesn't do all that exceptional of
a job. The front landing gear also sticks out a bit from the bottom even
if folded up onto the bottom of the ship all the way. The more annoying
extras, though, are the robot hands that are plainly visible if you extend
the wings into their "X" flight position, which really ruins the otherwise
pretty accurate look of the vehicle mode.

    The Mech mode is an
absolute mess. Geez, where do I start? Well, for one the proportions are
defintely off-- the main body is a bit too square and thick compared to
the head, the arms are too short, and the legs are far too skinny. His
wings are the big problem with this mode, though, as they just hang off
the mode and look TERRIBLE. The wings on the shoulders should have folded
in somewhere or something, but they just look weird, having these big wings
with little lower arms coming out from under them. For a completely unknown
reason, there are little tabs that restrict the shoulders from moving backwards,
too, which is really odd. The sliding ports that bring the wing-shoulders
forward during transformation are also entirely too loose, so Luke's arms
have a bad habit of sliding forward easily in this mode. The wings attached
to the back also make the figure so back-heavy it's hard to stand up properly,
and also are just really annoying kibble, given the missile launchers on
the back of them. Luke can hold the missile launchers in his hands, but
obviously he only has two hands, whereas he has four missile launchers
and a lightsaber, so he can't use all of his weapons at once. The orange
"jumpsuit" color used for the Mech parts also clashes with the main off-white
color. As for articulation, Luke is fairly well-articulated-- he can move
at the head, shoulders (at two points, though no backwards movement unless
you file down those stupid tabs), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips,
knees, and ankles. Much of this movement is restricted by all of his kibble
and his back-heavyness, however. About the only really positive things
I have to say about this mode are A. I like the "robotic Luke head in a
pilot helmet" head sculpt, and B. The "skirt" made out of some of the X-Wing
kibble looks pretty good. Overall, though, a terrible mode.

    Luke Skywalker is one
of the worst Star Wars Transformers out there, with an absolutely awful
robot mode. His vehicle mode is pretty good, but even it has some robot
extras problems, which is a rarity for a Star Wars Transformer. Not recommended.

      In order to bring balance back to the
Force, Luke Skywalker must confront and defeat Darth Vader. Using his attunement
with the Force, Luke converts into X-Wing fighter mode and travels across
the galaxy to face his foe. Using proton torpedoes and a barrage of missiles,
Luke battles Imperial fighters and ruthless bounty hunters as he embarks
on his quest to confront his destiny.
