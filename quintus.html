    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to PotP Vector Prime/Metalhawk.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of PotP Vector Prime/Metalhawk

     Quintus Prime is another
remold of PotP Vector Prime and the Bludgeon shell a remold of Metalhawk,
but it's even more of a remold than
     <a href="potptrion.html">

     --
only some of the "core" parts are shared on each. For Quintus Prime, the
legs and body share the same details as that of Vector Prime, but the rest
have been changed. The arms now have lines molded all across them, presumably
to homage Bludgeon's inner tank mode by looking like they're the bottom
of treads-- an unnecessary, but cool, change. The headsculpt has also been
changed-- it's still square, of course, given the Prime Master gimmick,
but there's now a substantial forehead on the toy, with a single visor
and a faceplate molded into the face-- again, this is to make the toy look
more like Bludgeon's inner robot mode from the G1 toy, and it looks pretty
good, even though it desperately needs some paint to bring out the details
from that orangish "cheesy" yellow plastic, which takes up the head, arms,
upper legs, and core emblem pieces. Meanwhile, the lower legs and body
are a fuchsia plastic, again mimicing Bludgeon's Pretender shell colors.
It's a decent color combo, though I wish the amounts of orange-yellow and
fuchsia had been switched, roughly. Not to mention that, as little as the
other Prime Master sets homage the actual Prime Masters, this one really
doesn't do it at all beyond the Prime Core mode-- like I mentioned, even
the inner robot mode directly homages Bludgeon's inner robot mode. As for
the Core Mode emblem, it's pretty darned cool and unique. The central Quintus
Prime emblem look is a circle surrounded by small tentacles on the sides
and two quite long curly antennae on top-- likely homaging the organic
look of the Quintessons, which Quintus Prime created in many continuities.
There's also several sharp squiggly lines surrounding the emblem, again
homaging the Quintessons' tentacles. The actual emblem itself is painted
a moderate shade of orange, however, which doesn't stick out enough against
the yellow-orange plastic around it.

     As for the Pretender
shell, the ONLY part it shares with Metalhawk is the large back section
and weapon mode handle. Granted, this IS the biggest piece on the toy,
but it's also just full of generic robotic details, and thus can be easily
reused. Everything that gives the shell character has been changed for
Bludgeon. The front piece-- which of course opens to allow the Prime Master
to fit inside-- has a lot of Bludgeon's characteristic "samurai skeleton"
details on it. The pronged fuchsia helmet, bone-white grinning skull (with
hollow eyes for the Prime Master to peak its head out of), and orange-yellow/gray
armored chest plate are all here. The samurai "skirt" detail has been painted
a nice bronze, with orange-yellow mechanical detailing used for the middle
of the legs and some more gray paint used on the sides of the skirt piece
to "fill up" that front section of the toy. The feet are fuchsia plastic,
as is the whole back section (which is, again, shared with Metalhawk).
The arms have been changed too, and are bulkier than on Metalhawk &amp;
Landmine, with broad shoulder armor and coily fuchsia lower arms, ending
in rather normal robotic fists. Finally, the weapon has been changed, and
it has a dual usage-- in the "official" Pretender weapon mode it's used
as a gun with some samurai weapon-esque detailing on the sides, with the
long lines and bumps making it almost look like it's made of wood despite
the orange-yellow coloration. In Bludgeon's robot mode, it can also be
used as a gun-- OR it can be held on the nub on one end and be used as
a bonking stick (the official term, apparently, is a kanabo). The hinge
on one end partially ruins the kanabo look, though.

     Quintus Prime/Bludgeon
is roughly average for a Prime Master set. He has the usual negatives and
positive for this size class, since the core design for all of the Prime
Masters is the same, but I do like the extra re-molding done for the toy
to make it more like Bludgeon in Pretender mode, as well as the awesome
amount of mold detailing and dual-use weapon. However, I'm not a fan of
the orange-yellow compared to most other colors (accurate or not), and
I wish something else beyond the core mode homaged Quintus Prime-- Bludgeon's
already been done multiple times by now, and better. I wish they had done
a Pretender toy that hadn't been re-done already instead.
