    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Terrorsaur Transmetal.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Terrorsaur Transmetal

     Beast mode is a metallic
pterodactyl. I like this fiery color scheme better than the original Terrorsaur
Transmetal's, and it makes this mode look almost like some kind of reptilian
phoenix. There have also been some new fading patterns, as is evident on
the wings and rear area. However, this mode still suffers from most of
the weaknesses of Transmetal Terrorsaur's, although there is one important
difference: the joints seem to be tighter, although this may just be my
toy. The claws and beak all have certain "locking points" in them that
stick very well.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Vehicular mode is very
weak, but then again, many of the Transmetal's vehicular modes are. A mold
change becomes apparent in this mode: under the rear plates, next to the
rocket jets, a green Dinobot spark crystal has been molded in. This is
a nice touch, but it also makes me a bit mad that Hasbro did this on this
transformer, but not on some other Dinobots, like
     <a href="twrecks.html">
      T-Wrecks
     </a>
     or
     <a href="dinotron.html">
      Dinotron
     </a>
     .
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Robot mode is nice,
but its color scheme resembles Transmetal Terrorsaur's a bit too much for
my liking; the legs, sides of the chest, and head are all almost exactly
the same colors! The only differences is that there are no yellow lines
on the upper legs, and the brown seems to be a slightly (and I stress SLIGHTLY)
lighter shade than Terrorsaur Transmetal's. Another mold change is also
apparent in this mode; his wing "boomerangs" on his arms are molded a little
different to come off and snap back on easier than they did on Terrosaur
Transmetal's. This is a nice touch.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     A great color scheme,
and some mold alterations make me recommend this toy over Terrorsaur Transmetal.
The beast and vehicular modes are still a bit poor, though.

       Terranotron thinks very highly of himself,
but he backs up his boasts when he's in battle. Loves it when the odds
are against him. Takes on multiple squadrons of jet drones by himself,
then follows it by plasma-bombing divisions of tank drones on the ground.
Exterior Alloy coating makes him invisible to enemy detection. Convinced
that aerial strategy is the key to defeating the Vehicons, and argues the
point constantly with ground-based Maximals. The friction fades when they
enter battle, though - he may be a hotshot, but he's always a team fighter
in combat.
