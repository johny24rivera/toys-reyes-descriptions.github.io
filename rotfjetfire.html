    Jetfire's vehicle mode
is an SR-71 Blackbiard-- well, more or less. This is REALLY a "only look
at him from above!" vehicle mode, as his robot parts hang out pretty blatantly
from the bottom of the SR-71 "shell" on the top. The worst offenders are
the hands under his nosecone, but it's his whole robot mode is pretty much
all along the underside here. Still, alt mode kibble is the easiest to
overlook in this mode, simply because the Blackbird mode is so. Freaking.
HUGE. Granted, he really spreads out, but WOW this is a big vehicle mode.
Makes the other Leader class molds look tiny by comparison. The panel detailing
is quite good in this ode, and the little military-esque detailing, such
as "JTFR", the scraped-off Decepticon symbol on the wings, and the varius
military markers on his tailfins are all done quite well. He has three
deployable landing gear in this mode-- which you'll pretty much need if
you don't want him to just sit on his uneven kibble-- and a standard spring-loaded
missile launcher underneath the front of this mode. It's also pretty darn
accurate proportionally if you just go by the vehicle parts.

    It should be noted here
that Jetfire is one of the most difficult Transformers to convert that
I've ever owned, to the point where he's one the few I genuinely HATE to
transform, especially from robot mode into vehicle mode. You have to get
everything-- both the robot mode parts and the panels-- to line up JUST
right in vehicle mode for everything to snap together, and the wing-turbine
pieces come undone way too easily regardless, which can of course set the
whole thing to start creaking apart as you try to fix the loose turbines.
It's just... augh. AUGH. I don't think I've ever transformed him to vehicle
mode in less than half an hour.

    Jetfire's robot mode
is definitely the weaker of his two primary modes, mostly in proportions
and the sheer amount of kibble hanging off of him. I mean, pretty much
his entire vehicle mode is hanging off his back and his arms, albeit at
places somewhat compressed. It just doesn't look good in the least, and
really hinders his movement and balance. His proportions aren't very accurate
to the movie model, either-- the arms are way too skinny, he doesn't have
enough of a "hunch" formed from his armor and thus too much of a "normal"
chest. His legs are a bit more accurate, though a bit overly spindly between
the knees and the feet. Here he gets a bit more of a color scheme with
dark blue and light gray/silver being the main colors in addition to just
black, and although not bad, it's far from eye-catching, either. One of
the good bits about this mode is the sheer amount of mold detailing that's
gone into him, impressive even for a movie toy. His arm in particular are
COVERED in gear and piston detailing, and I quite like it looks like his
jet engines form his knees (though that's not really how his transformation
works). His head is also quite well-done, pulling off the "old man" vibe
pretty well for a robot what with the slivers of metal making up his "beard"
and "ear hair"-- those bits are made of rubbery plastic, however, so they
can get permanently bent if you're not careful. The fake cockpit for a
forehead was also a nice touch. In addition to a standard handheld missile
launcher, Jetfire also comes with a "cane" made from his primary landing
gear in vehicle mode, which is incredibly creative and just plain hilarious.
It could stand to be a bit longer, though. As for electronics, if you pull
down on the lever on his chest, his eyes and chest will blink a few times
while he says "Jetfire's mah name" in a... fair... imitation of his movie
voice. I wish he had more sound effects than just that, though. As far
as articulation, Jetfire can move side-to-side at the neck as well as the
shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), at the base of his three
fingers on each hand (which all move as one piece), and at the hips (at
two points), knees (at three points), and ankles (at two points). It sounds
like a lot, but as mentioned before all the kibble, along with his odd
body and leg structure make him considerably more limited in movement than
it would appear from a description.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    As weak as his robot
mode is, Jetfire's combined form with Optimus Prime-- called "Jetpower
Optimus Prime"-- is truly an awful mess. It's basically Jetfire's form
spread out as thin as possibly to more or less encase most of Optimus'
basic robot mode form. It's not solid at all, gives him awful balance,
has kibble EVERYWHERE, and just... I really don't have anything positive
to say about this mode except it gives Optimus more weapons, and the big
Blackird engines don't look all that bad. Still-- the less said about this
mode (which is also a royal pain to get the figures into), the better.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Jetfire is the perfect
example of a design that looks good on paper (or as a CGI robot in a movie)
but whose design doesn't translate that well to reality. All of his modes
suffer to one degree or another. His vehicle mode is easily the best, only
having a bit of obvious robot mode kibble if looked at from a side or bottom
view, but his robot mode is positively drowning in Blackbird parts and
has terrible proportions, and his combined mode with Prime is an absolute
failure. Combine all this with his incredibly difficult transformation,
and I wouldn't recommend him to anyone but the most hardcore completists

    fans. Get the (I can't
believe I'm saying this) Legends version instead if you want a good representation
of the character.

      Jetfire grew tired of war a long time
ago. The reckless ambition of the Decepticons, and the senseless violence
of their war sickened him, and so he left Cybertron to go into hiding.
The form he eventually chose on Earth seemed appropriate for one who wished
to remain unseen. He slumbered in peace for years. Now, reawakened by the
arrival of the war on Earth, he decides once again to enter the fight--
this time on the side of the Autobots, and this time to end it for good,
whatever the cost.
