    Bumblebee's vehicle mode
is a yellow muscle/sports car-- as it's been for a while now, ever since
the early movie days. It keeps the general "feel" of a Chevrolet Camaro,
while making the lines a bit more slick and futuristic. The black lines
across Bumblebee in this mode really help with this look-- instead of just
one or two "straight" stripes, Bumblebee has three different sets of stripes
(four, if you count the little short stripes in front of his exposed engine),
and some of them go off at a diagonal angle (at more than one point, sometimes),
making the usual Bumblebee deco considerably more visually interesting
this time-- it's definitely the part of this new Bumblebee's vehicle mode
I like the best. (That said, two little gray hinges right in the middle
of his side stripes ruin the look there a little.) There's no robot mode
extras at all in this mode, though you CAN see Bumblebee's arms fairly
plainly inside the transparent blue plastic on his windows-- I wish they
had tinted those windows darker to hide this. The mold detailing is minimal
in this mode due to the sleekness of it and its general look in the cartoon,
but there's plenty of paint apps-- besides the aforementioned stripes,
both his red taillights and bright orange blinker-headlights are painted,
along with his tire hubs, grill, and his exposed engine. This leaves no
area on Bumblebee with TOO much yellow in this mode, which is definitely
a good thing, and all of his colors help to contrast against the the yellow
pretty well-- with the exception of the orange and light red, as they're
so bright they don't look quite as good. Other than his tailpipes, pretty
much everything's covered in this mode, paint-wise.

    Bumblebee's transformation
is slightly more complex than you'd think-- I almost rated his transformation
"hard", but except for the chest, everything is pretty straightforward.
The way so many bits come together for his chest-- his head (which is on
the bottom of his engine block piece; you flip it around), the sides of
the front of his car, his robot waist, a small piece in the center with
his Autobot insignia on it (that can easily be covered up by all the other
pieces)-- it all has a nice, pseudo-movie "fragmented" look to it, but
it all feels a bit too... touchy, I guess. His main chest pieces lock into
place decently enough, but they can still move around on other joints fairly
easily, and his waist and shoulders in particular have a tendency to not
look "natural" in their default positions. I realize that Bumblebee has
become more and more of "light warrior"-type character in recent years,
but having Bumblebee's big, beefy wheel-shoulders stick out THIS much from
the sides, and have his waist be this tiny in comparison to how wide his
chest is, looks a bit weird. His shoulders also line up with the front
of his chest, which looks off from a side view, like he's always leaning
forwards and flexing. However, this aside, this mode is pretty good, with
little kibble (the only pieces I would really call kibble are the chunks
of car on the sides of his legs, and even then they stay out of the way
and are minimal pieces of kibble, at best). His roof folds down onto his
shoulder-wings, and his face is mostly round, with large eyes (with excellently-done
light piping) and a faceplate. It's pretty obvious that Prime Bumblebee
takes pretty much all of his major design cues from his movie incarnation
as opposed to his G1 version, that's for sure. Bumblebee's mold detailing
is still relatively sparse in this mode (except for a few spots like his
waist), but it's done in a neat, stylized manner that is both very curvy
at some parts like his shoulders and lower arms, and pointy at spots like
his elbows and knees. His color distribution has more gray in it in this
mode, though most of it's a dark, swirly, semi-metallic shade of the color,
and thus actually works pretty well as a "neutral" color against all that
yellow, and is not bland at all in the amounts that it's used. His paint
apps mostly carry over from the car mode, but I particularly like how the
black stripes on his various chest &amp; waist pieces are painted so it
all looks like they're just fragments of two stripes carried over from
his vehicle mode-- nice attention to detail, there. For articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
rotation at the waist, and movement at the hips (at two points), knees,
and ankles. Thus, you can get some good poses out of him, though the awkward
angle of his shoulders and waist make some poses look off. For a weapon,
Bumblebee has a little two-barreled energy blaster that can plug into either
of his lower arms, though unfortunately it can't store anywhere in vehicle
mode, which irks me a little.

    Prime First Edition
Bumblebee is-- like many toys released in this early subline for the show--
the best overall (and also most complex) toy of the character you'll find,
who is also the most show-accurate. However, that said, though his car
mode is largely flawless, his robot mode does suffer from some proportional
awkwardness, particularly at the waist and shoulders. Still, if you want
a version of Prime Bumblebee and don't mind a fiddly chest-- this is the
version you want.
