    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Ransack.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen
Ransack

     Believe it or not, this
Divebomb is meant to be the same

     from the first movie-- a bit of a "downgrade" given the vehicle mode, no?
Regardless, this version of Divebomb is a bit of an homage to the famous
Red Baron biplane. The paint job mimics it perfectly-- the red is just
about the right shade, and the white and black both serve as excellent
contrast colors against the red. However, compared to Ransack, Divebomb's
colors look more "new" and less worn, which for me doesn't really fit a
historic alt mode like this. For the most part Divebomb has a pretty good
number of paint apps, but nearly all the paint apps he has are either black
or white. I understand why this was done-- to keep it his vehicle mode
a bit more accurate to the Red Baron's signature paint job-- but it means
his color scheme isn't as varied as I usually like it. Most of the more
unique colors are sadly only used on his robot head, like the metallic
bronze and gunmetal gray.

     RotF Divebomb is an
excellent homage to the Red Baron's aircraft, but if that by itself isn't
enough to get you to buy this toy than I'd stick with its original release
as Ransack. Even though Ransack's colors are a bit duller and more eye-catching,
it's more varied, realistic, and "worn"-looking, which I think just looks
better on an alt mode as old as this one, as opposed to Divebomb's pretty
straight shade of red.

       Entranced with the romance and daring
of ancient Decepticons living on Earth, Divebomb rescanned his vehicle
mode to mimic one of the most famous of those old warriors. Unfortunately,
paired with Skystalker to fight an Autobot antiaircraft specialist, he's
quickly learning the limitations of his new form.
