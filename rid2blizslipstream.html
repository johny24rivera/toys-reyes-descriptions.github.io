    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 Slipstream
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original RID2015

     Given that his "brother"
Mini-Con and boss got a
     <a href="rid2deployerblizdrift.html">
      "Blizzard
Strike" redeco
     </a>
     , it's only proper that Slipstream gets one, too. For
Slipstream here, it's a strict palette-swap, however; no new paint applications
have been added, though none have been taken away, either. The red on the
original has been replaced by a glittery arctic blue of a medium shade--
it's a pretty decent shade, though it's a bit lighter than the darker blue
shade on his Blizzard Strike brethren, which I think is a bit of a missed
opportuinity to make him and Jetstorm in particular "mesh" better together.
The black on the original has been replaced with a very dark, dull navy
blue, which contrasts fairly well with the medium blue. Both shades of
blue have a bit of glitter in them, just like ice, which of course fits
the whole theme of this redeco. It's also a nice way to keep Slipstream
"in theme" with his buddies while being a bit different as well, what with
a very dark blue in place of a lighter arctic-y blue on the others. As
with the original Slipstream, the only paint apps on the toy are on the
face, and they're mostly silver-- the face and the headcrest are painted
silver, while the eyes are still metallic blue (and don't really stand
out against the surrounding plastic). Unfortunately, Slipstream's armor
bits are the exact same fiery orange shade as that on the original. Although
from a stand-alone perspective the orange contrasts with the blues pretty
well, it doesn't fit with the icy transparent armor of Blizzard Strike
Jetstorm at all. Plus, it just makes a significant color of this version
of Slipstream the same as on the original, which I think was a bad choice
in terms of giving someone incentive to buy the mold again.

     Blizzard Strike Slipstream
is a decent redeco to go with the Blizzard Strike Drift w/ Jetstorm set
to complete the trio, but a couple of opportunities were missed with this
redeco-- specifically not changing the color of the armor, and not making
the medium shade of blue the same as that on Drift &amp; Jetstorm. Taken
by itself, I'd just
     <i>
      barely
     </i>
     recommend this version more than the
original, if you only want one.
