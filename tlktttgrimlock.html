    For Grimlock, the superdeformed
look manifests itself in his beast mode as well, though not quite to the
same extent as on most other Tiny Turbo Changers' robot modes-- the head
is definitely a bit big, but not as outrageously as you'd expect. The biggest
issue about the alt mode is that the tail for Grimlock is pretty obviously
just his robot mode head-- it's far too short and skinny, and in just that
exact same position as his robot head crest. There's also some extra bits
below his chin, which become his feet in robot mode. Oddly, the sculpt
as a whole seems to be taken from the AoE "pre-movie model" toys, as opposed
the CGI model, even though the toy was MADE for the TLK movie line. The
"horns" on the dino mode are more inline with their smaller look on the
AoE toys, and of course his major color is a light muddy brown, more inline
with his inaccurate AoE toy colors compared to the gray/green on the movie
model. (In fact, in beast mode the light muddy brown is his ONLY color,
beyond the blue eyes.) As with most TTTs, the sculpting is surprisingly
detailed when needed-- he's got the bony vertebrae sticking out his back,
the oversized maw and teeth (though being superdeformed, his are in a smile),
his large claws on the feet, and some odd tendon-like details on his hips.
For articulation in t-rex mode, Grimlock can move back-and-forth at the
hips.

    The transformation for
Grimlock could hardly be simpler-- just separate his dino head into his
two legs, stand him up, and angle the legs down to become his arms. The
end result is largely good for a superdeformed toy (especially considering
the price point), but the dino arms just kinda hang off the sides of his
waist unceremoniously, not even with an attempt made at passing them off
as something else. This mode is definitely meant to be looked at from the
front-- from a side view, you basically just see the t-rex mode details.
The mold details for the robot mode are, again, pretty good, with the headsculpt
for his superdeformed head accurate-- to his AoE toy, at least. Again,
the toy oddly ignores the updates made to the movie model. He does have
the long crest on top of his helmet, and he's got a multifaceted faceplate
with scowling blue eyes. There's the faux dino teeth on his chest-- along
with an Autobot symbol-- and his shoulders have smaller, faux dino head-halves
on the tops. His hands are sculpted on the back of his dino feet, and can
hold TTT-sized weapons. His waist and legs aren't as well-detailed as the
rest of him-- probably because you can more easily see them on the underside
of the t-rex mode-- and are just some plated/armored details with his pointed
"knight" feet at the bottom. The chest, long headcrest, and faceplate are
painted silver, while his eyes are still blue-- otherwise he's still completely
that light muddy brown from beast mode. For movement in this mode, Grimlock
can move back-and-forth at the shoulders and slightly side-to-side at the
hips due to the transformation.

    I'm kinda surprised
that, despite how incredibly simple Grimlock is, he still manages to look
as close to the general design of the large toys as he does in both modes.
Oh, there's compromises, to be sure-- the "tail" in beast mode, the arms
hanging off the chest in robot mode-- but he doesn't just have "shell pieces"
hanging off them. One of the better Tiny Turbo Changer designs.
