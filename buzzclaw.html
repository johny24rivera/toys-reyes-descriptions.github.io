    Beast mode is a mantis
with reptilian feet. Looks very nice in this mode, although his robot legs
can be easily seen under his tail. Press the tab on his back, and his
mantis arms will spread themselves out, making a "slashing attack", although
it is really kind of weak.

    Robot mode has a lot
of extras. His reptilian feet and big and stick to the bottom of his hands,
and his tail mantis hands and wings stick out in the back, although the
wings are probably supposed to. You can rectify this by taking off his
backpack and using it as a weapon, while taking the tail off and using
it as a shield (pictured above). While the shield looks okay this way,
the weapon just looks rather... odd. Other than that, an okay mode, with
a mean-looking face, and great detailing.

    A basically okay fuzor,
but not that recommended it you see others you dont have. Also, dont
confuse his name with

    , the deluxe non-fuzor
hornet (and the basic Beast Machines wasp).

      Part mantis, part lizard, Buzzclaw has
all the makings of a ferocious but sly warrior. In beast mode Buzzclaw
crushes his enemies with spiny pincers and venomous mandibles while a powerful
tail lashes out to land his surprised prey on their backside. As a flying
robot Buzzclaw generates lethal ion discs from his forearm-mounted stilettos,
paralyzing his victims and rendering them helpless. Generally stoic and
silent, when it comes to the business of battle Buzzclaw is arrogant, resourceful,
and intent on the job at hand.
