    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cyber Slammer
Barricade toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Cyber Slammer Barricade toy

     Even though he's a kiddy
toy aimed at very young Transformers fans-in-the-making, I like Patrol
Barricade's colors considerably better than the mainline repaint
     <a href="reconbarricade.html">
      Recon
Barricade
     </a>
     toy he's based on. (Why they re-named him Patrol Barricade,
I have no idea-- maybe it sounds more "kid-friendly" than "Recon".) Instead
of being mostly a dull gray, Patrol Barricade's main color is a light blue
with a bit of glitter mixed in with the metal to make it look semi-shiny.
It really works quite well as a main color, and Barricade's prequisite
black coloration-- this time used as a secondary color-- goes very well
with it. The light blue "SHERIFF" markings and lines on the side doors
not so much, though, as they're a bit TOO close in shade to the main color
of blue. The other painted details on Patrol Barricade look great, though,
including the silver headlights, bright red taillights, red/blue siren,
and a bit of use of pale yellow for the second pair of headlights also
looks quite good. The dark metallic silvery blue used for the windows,
as opposed to being a lighter color, also helps the toy look more "evil"
in its chibified vehicle mode than it otherwise would have, which I think
helps add to the intended effect. (I don't care how light-colored that
face, is, though, Barricade's robot face just does NOT belong on an otherwise
cutesy toy like this.)

     Patrol Barricade is
a pretty nice repaint of the Cyber Slammer Barricade mold, and certainly
has a more attractive scheme than Recon Barricade. Still, though, nothing
fits a police car quite like black, and Barricade is no exception, so I'd
still recommend the original Cyber Slammer toy slightly over this one.
