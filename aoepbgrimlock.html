    Grimlock's form for his
Power Battler version is a wigged-out t-rex, just like for his other AoE
toys, and... hoo boy. Well, um... the head looks pretty nice, if not quite
accurate to the movie model. The front dino-arms are also adequately small,
and the legs are pretty good overall; other than the hollow-ness of the
lower legs I don't really have anything bad to say about them. Grimlock's
color scheme is also very much in keeping with his other mass retail toys,
with a brownish bronze being his main color-- though for this version,
there's more light milky gray and metallic gunmetal gray, particularly
of the former. You likely know by now how I feel about light milky gray
(i.e., it's very boring), though the dark gunmetal gray both contrasts
against the brown and compliments it, so I don't mind that as a secondary
color. The articulation for this mode is also pretty good for a t-rex (particularly
from the Power Battler subline), with movement at the hips (at two points),
knees, ankles, the dino shoulders (both arms as one piece), at the jaw
(open or closed; there's a spring that auto-closes it if you don't move
it out enough to "lock" it lightly into place in its set "open" position).
He can also move up-and-down at the base of the head. However, the main
body and tail of this mode... ugh. Just... how obvious can they possibly
make Grimlock's robot mode bits?! His head and chest are VERY obviously
RIGHT THERE making up the lower part of the main body, with the robot waist
only slightly less obviously folded onto the lower dino back, like some
kind of overly large diaper. The tail is downright laughable, being one
of Grimlock's arms holding his mace weapon, which is tabbed (not solidly)
into the dino-butt to form Grimlock's "tail"-- a two-headed mace where
one end actually slides back-and-forth a bit, not even giving the tail
a set length. Just... I mean, I know I have to temper my expectations given
the audience the Power Battler subline is aimed at, but head and legs aside
this dino mode is just BAD and too obviously his robot mode doing yoga.

    Grimlock's transformation
to robot mode is pretty darned obvious from how his dino mode is set up,
with the dino head being the only part that isn't outright obvious-- and
that's because that head is easily the weakest part of the robot mode.
It just sort of.. crumples up some, with the jaw opening up and the snout
folding in on the skull a bit. Is that... is that supposed to be a hand?
Because it looks like Grimlock somehow impaled a crumpled-up t-rex skull
on the end of his right arm. I doesn't look remotely like any kind of hand.
The rest of this mode is at least better than Grimlock's t-rex mode (talk
about faint praise), with-- again-- the legs generally looking pretty good,
and his other arm obviously being an arm. His mold detailing and proportions
are a bit off in this mode, and I'm completely ignoring the bad t-rex head-arm
when I saw that-- the bone-like armor "shard" details from some of the
t-rex parts like the legs look pretty good, but the rest of him looks a
bit... mis-shapen. Like the sculptor got everything just right, and then
someone just fudged with the mold a little when no one was looking and
no one noticed. All the necessary details are there-- the head is roughly
accurate, he's got the fake "dino teeth" on the chest, armor plating on
the waist and stomach and arms, fake "dino jaws" on the shoulders-- but
it's all wrong. The arm is too bulky, especially on the upper half, the
waist is too large and-- again-- looks like some sort of diaper, the stomach
and chest are a bit too small, he's got a pin-head with the actual headsculpt
looking rather indistinct, and the dino-jaws are too small in proportion
to the arms and look off. Everything except the legs just looks... off.
But hey, Grimlock's got "spinning mace" action! And it IS a cool action
feature... just probably not in the way Hasbro intended. Instead of his
arm moving like he's clubbing someone when you move the small gunmetal
lever on his upper back up-and-down, instead his hand, arm, and mace twirl
around like he's a baton twirler in a marching band. No, not like... EXACTLY
like he's a baton twirler in a marching band. It's rather hilarious, and
honestly addictive-- again, in a way I'm sure Hasbro didn't intend. On
the plus side, Grimlock has pretty good articulation in robot mode for
a Power Battler-- he can move at the shoulders (two points on the right
arm, one on the left), sideways at the right elbow (?), and he has waist
rotation (!), wrist rotation on the left arm, the ability to tilt his upper
body up at the waist due to his transformation, and movement at the hips
(at two points), knees, and ankles.

    Being a Power Battler
intended for a younger audience-- and having to make certain sacrifices
for budgetary reasons and for simplicity's sake-- I try to take it easy
on the Power Battler subline. That said, Grimlock is AWFUL. His t-rex mode
looks like he threw out his back while picking up something in robot mode,
with the t-rex head and legs being the only solid parts, while in robot
mode nearly all his mold sculpting and proportions look dulled and "off"
slightly, and a right arm that doesn't even try to look like it has a hand.
The action feature is nifty, but in a hilarious sort of way, and not the
way it was intended. If you're looking for a simple-to-transform toy of
AoE Grimlock, get the

    version instead-- in everything but articulation, it's considerably better.
