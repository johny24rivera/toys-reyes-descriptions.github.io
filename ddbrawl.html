    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Leader
class Brawl toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie Leader class Brawl toy

     True to his name, Deep
Desert Brawl is certainly colored to fit right in in a desert environment
(for the most part). His main color is a light tan that is very sandy in
its coloration, and the secondary colors of black and muddy brown go great
with the tan. Still, if you just consider those three colors, he still
looks a bit dull. What really makes the toy, in my opinion, is the Allspark
electric blue. Normally I wouldn't think light blue and tan would go together
well, but for reason it works EXTREMELY well on this toy, particularly
in robot mode in contast with the muddy brown. It gives the toy something
to make it more individual than "just another desert camo". I'm not too
fond of the transparent light blue, though, as light blue missile launchers
and the light blue tip of the main cannon barrel just look odd-- a solid
blue or a clear plastic would have worked better. In addition to the blue,
Deep Desert Brawl's paint apps are really what makes the toy stand out--
again, particularly in robot mode. In that mode, Brawl's got paint apps
all over the place, though they look particularly spectacular on his head,
with has pretty much every color on his body on it, laid out in a very
eye-pleasing manner. The downside of having so many paint apps visible
in robot mode, however, is that it means less are visible in his vehicle
mode, which in contrast to the original Leader class Brawl toy looks a
bit dull. It's got a couple of black "battle damage" marks, some fake military
ID markings, and even a cool "X-ed out Autobot kills count" on the side
of its tank mode, but there's still too much of his tank mode that is left
plain tan without a camo pattern or anything.

     No mold changes have
been made to Deep Desert Brawl, and the electronic sounds and lights are
the same as well.

     Deep Desert Brawl is
an incredible repaint, not only giving a completely different, but fairly
realistic new paint job to the toy, but giving the toy a ton of paint apps
in robot mode. Plus, the Allspark blue just looks fantastic contrasting
with the other colors, in my opinion. His tank mode is a bit dull, but
overall I'd definitely recommend this repaint over the original Leader
class Brawl.

       Saturated with power from the AllSpark
and freed from the influence of Megatron, Decepticon Brawl disappeared
into the rugged land around the Hoover Dam. Making his way over the course
of months to the most troubled spot on Earth, he adapted his vehicle mode
to the new environment, went to ground and waited. Hiding in the deep desert,
he soaks up energy from the blazing sun, and emerges only to satisfy his
hunger for destruction by attacking and annihilating human convoys and
armored columns. He is a ghost in the desert, attacking randomly and without
reason, and disappearing before human air power can arrive to track him.
To those living in the region, he is a myth, but to those few who survive
his attacks he is a monster.
