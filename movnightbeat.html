    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Booster X10. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Booster X10

     Night Beat 7 is pretty
much the polar opposite of Booster X10, not only in terms of allegiance
but also color scheme. Where Booster X10, as an homage to Laserbeak, had
a rather fiery color scheme of black, red, and orange, Night Beat here
has a cool color scheme of light blue, dark blue, and gray/silver. It really
fits well on the toy, making Night Beat look like some sort of mecahnical
bluebird in bird mode. I especially like the nice mix of light blue, silver,
and dark blue paint apps on the bird's head, though the gray on his legs
and his relatively unbroken light blue color on his headphone-gun both
look rather bland. In mp3 player mode, he has a really nice-looking metallic
teal paint on his topside with silver paint on the sides, and if it wasn't
for that darned transparent viewscreen that has no details on it at all,
it'd look very close to an actual mp3 player.

     Night Beat 7 is an excellent
repaint of an already excellent Real Gear mold. Because the colors in his
mp3 player mode are metallic and much more real-looking than Booster X10's
alternate mode, I'd have to rate Night Beat ever-so-slightly higher than
Booster, even though I like Booster's bird mode color layout a tad better.

       Most of the other Real Gear Robots focus
on covering their tracks, but Night Beat 7 makes it his job to expose them
to the light. Using sophisticated reality-search software, he constantly
scans the world around him for evidence that a Decepticon has been at work.
HeÂ’s trained in finding the most obscure evidence from the faint time particle
trail left by Meantime, to the sonic leftovers of the mischievous Booster
X10.
