    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Terradive.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Terradive

     Like the other Machine
Wars "updates", Starscream's look isn't based on anything resembling his
G1 version (beyond being a Decepticon jet). He's based on the mold that
was eventually used to make
     <a href="kingatlas.html">
      Universe 1.0 King
Atlas
     </a>
     (to link it to a mold I've already reviewed, since I never reviewed
the orignal Machine Wars toys). He mimics the color scheme of his Machine
Wars version fairly closely, with black being a main color, as well as
a fair amount of light milky gray-- the latter particularly in robot mode.
Unfortunately, it's that pretty blah version of light milky gray I think
looks boring and I really am not fond of-- I wish FunPub had used a more
metallic version of the plastic color or something. If you think this would
make for a pretty boring color scheme, well... you'd be right. Starscream
does have some additional colors and paint apps, though-- most notably
the light green paint on his trident and a bit on his robot chest, both
of which contrast excellently against the black (less so against the gray,
but it still looks good). There's also a bit of silver paint on the bottom
of the nosecone, and on small bits on his wings. There are some other accent
colors, but they're used rather sparingly; Starscream has some white on
his face and some red on his forehead crest to mimic somewhat the original
Machine Wars toy, and some dark red paint apps on his knees and behind
his cockpit. (The cockpit, by the by, is a transparent dark blue-- unfortunately
a bit TOO dark to really contrast against the black much.) There's also
a bit of dark blue paint on his lower legs, the Decepticon "elite" emblems
on his wings and on his robot chest that connect him with
     <a href="bcmegaplex.html">
      Megaplex
     </a>
     ,
and "shark" eyes and jaw paint apps along the sides of his nosecone. Unfortunately,
the latter look pitifully small in comparison to the size of the nosecone.
This was partially due to the mold's transformation, but honestly given
how small it is I think it looks more goofy than cool. The mold itself
also just doesn't fit Machine Wars Starscream all that well-- for one,
it's far too small as a deluxe, while the original MW Starscream was known
for being ridiculously huge. The wings are also more curved and aerodynanmic,
and beyond having a long nosecone it doesn't fit the profile of MW Starscream
all that well. The head does share a couple of similarities like a masked
face and the shape of the headcrest, but it's also noticeably skinnier
than the original and this version as a whole seems a stretch. Additionally,
the original MW Starscream had its colors spread more evenly throughout
the toy, whereas with this toy, the jet mode is straight-up boring, having
far too much unbroken black on it.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Starscream. It's worth noting that, in addition to being a
BotCon 2013 exclusive, this toy was only available ("free") if you preregistered
as a Primus attendant AND picked up the set in person at the convention.
NORMALLY, this would mean that he'd fetch a pretty penny, but this year's
set as a whole was in very low demand, so he can be picked up pretty cheaply
for a BotCon exclusive.

     BotCon 2013 Machine
Wars Starscream is an excellent mold, but as an homage to Machine Wars
Starscream it falls rather flat, not being close enough to the original
source for my liking-- and just as a toy, he's a bit boring with not enough
coloration. This is particularly bad in vehicle mode, where there's large
patches of unbroken black. Definitely one of the weaker exclusives from
this BotCon, if you ask me.

       Starscream is not the same robot as
his template-- although he retains all of the intellect and guile of the
original Starscream, this clone portrays none of the treachery or desire
for power. He is content with his position within the ranks of this new
generation of Decepticons and is unwavering in his loyalty to Jhiaxus.

       Considering himself to be the smartest,
most sophisticated Decepticon, Starscream attempts to pass his refinement
to those under his command. He believes that they should rely on astuteness
and speed rather than brute force. However, as commander of a fleet of
massive bombers, the force Starscream wields might possibly be the most
brutish of all of Jhiaxus' Decepticons.
