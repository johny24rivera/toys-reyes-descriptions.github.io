    Scorn is a new Dinobot
for TF4 (and the only completely new one to appear in the actual movie
itself), and has the alt mode of a wacked-out metallic spinosaurus. (On
an off-note, I do REALLY like his name-- it both is fierce-sounding and
fits in with the single-syllable "S" names of the other non-Grimlock Dinobots.)
In beast mode, Scorn looks pretty darned fierce and just plain awesome,
and his proportions are pretty much perfect. There are a few minor robot
extras-- the top of the robot head is somewhat obvious on his left side,
and a couple of robot bits are slightly visible around his waist, but other
than that this mode is extra-free, which is quite the accomplishment for
an alt mode like this. Scorn's mold detailing is one of the most intricate
of all the movie toys', and that's really saying something-- he's got spikes
EVERYWHERE, from the obvious spine along his back to all the little spikes
on his tail, his sharp teeth, the sides of his legs... what little isn't
covered with spikes is molded like bones (such as Scorn's neck) or like
segmented armor (such as the main body). Because of all the spikes, Scorn
has a decent amount of rubbery plastic for safety reasons-- his entire
tail and spine-spikes are all rubbery, but you can't really pose him in
a way that bends these parts, so I don't see them being an issue years
down the line. (On a side note, the single spine may be more in-line with
your traditional spinosaurus, but it isn't accurate to Scorn's on-screen
appearance, which had three rows of more haphazard, giant spikes on his
back.) The color scheme is also quite unique, giving Scorn a rather fiery
appearance with a good mix of red and some nice jagged orange paint apps
on his main body. There's also myriad shades of gray used for secondary
colors, from a straightforward flat gray on his main spines to a brownish
gray on his underside to a a more medium milky gray used on most of his
face and neck. By and large they serve as neutral colors to keep the color
scheme from looking too loud, though I wish a little more of the gray was
of a nice gunmetal shade (or that a little of the gray had instead been
orange). Scorn also has a pretty varied color scheme-- between all the
shades of gray, the orange paint apps, the painted eyes and tail, and the
bits of red on the spine, he has a pretty good number of paint apps, here.
For articulation in this mode, Scorn can move at the jaw, neck (at three
points), shoulders, hips (at two points), and knees (at three points).
I wish his tail could move as it's locked in place this mode, and some
arm elbow movement would also have been appreciated, but generally he's
pretty poseable, all things considered. All this said, the weight of Scorn's
tail can cause him to fall back on that, so you have to position his legs
a bit further forward than you might sometimes like to get him to stand
on his own.

    Scorn's transformation
is rather unique, with the side actually forming the front of the robot
mode and the head and tail forming the arms. First, let's look at the positives--
Scorn still looks quite good proporitonally, with the only caveat here
being that his waist may be just a TAD too long and his legs just a TAD
too short, but they're very minor proportional maladies. The mold detailing
is even more exquisite in this mode, with tons of layered armor and spine-like
details on his chest and stomach. His color scheme is still broken up quite
well, despite not having many paint apps specific to his robot mode (pretty
much just the silver on the sides of his waist and his robot head)-- all
the different shades of gray, again, help break up all the colors quite
well. There's also several parts of his transformation that just strike
me as ingenious-- the use of his tail as a lance-arm; the way the sides
of his dino hips form a sort of armor "skirt" that is molded to look like
more dino teeth (as if he needed more spikes!); how his spine splits into
two and goes behind his upper back, framing this mode quite well and giving
it a unique silhouette; how his middle dino toe on each foot folds backwards
to give Scorn the same sort of pointy "knight shoes" that the other AoE
Dinobots have; and how his face looks like a pretty straightforward angular
knight helmet with a faceplate, helping him fit right in with his fellow
"knight" Dinobots. All this said, there are a few obvious dino mode extras,
the most egregious of which is Scorn's right arm. The way the fist comes
out of the top of the head and the jaw folds backwards gives him a jaw
hanging off his elbow and an obvious gap in his lower arm. I prefer to
ignore the instructions and only unfold the hand from the dino-head, alleviating
both of these issues, though in turn this makes the dino head all the more
obviously his right arm. There's also the front arms of the dino mode just
hanging behind Scorn's butt. It doesn't get in the way of articulation
much, but it still definitely looks ugly. For articulation in this mode,
Scorn can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows, slightly
at the wrist on the right arm, and at the hips (at two points) and knees
(at two points). Unfortunately because of his transformation he doesn't
have waist movement, but otherwise he's quite poseable and well-balanced.
For a bonus weapon, a sword slides out from underneath Scorn's tail to
be held in his only normal hand, giving him another big spike to stick
into someone.

    Scorn is my favorite
deluxe from the Age of Extinction line. He looks fantastic in both modes,
has a unique transformation and good-to-great articulation, a nice color
scheme, extremely well-done mold detailing, and tons of unique design cues
and creative usage of his dino parts in robot mode. He only has a few minor
kibble issues for downsides. Highly recommended if you at all like the
idea of a dino made of knives that also becomes a knight robot.

      Scorn has the jaws of a dino and the
