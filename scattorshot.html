    Scattorshot's vehicle
mode is an artillery vehicle. And for a Scout, this guy's packin', I'll
tell you what! Two big push-missiles, a double-barreled gun, and if you
insert his Cyber Key into the rear of the vehicle, a missile launcher folds
out! Pretty nifty gimmick for such a small toy. (And small he is, even
for a Cybertron scout.) His rear platform can also rotate around so he
can fire at any Decepticons trying to attack him from the sides. The detailing
on Scattorshot is also pretty good, too-- lots of nice mechanical paneling
and armor plate detailing on this dude. He's also got a good amount of
paint detailing, too-- love the dull gold used on his missile rack and
rear treads especially. The blue, gray, black, and tan color scheme also
goes together very well, to the point where I think Scattorshot has the
best color scheme out of any of the first two Scout waves of Cybertron.
The only real problem I have with this mode is that his tan robot shoulder
panels are rather noticeable on the sides of the vehicle mode-- making
them blue like the surrounding plastic would have eliminated this effect,
I don't see why Hasbro didn't.

    Scattorshot's robot
mode also looks rather cool, even if the transformation has the "been there,
done that" feeling to it. His proportions are generally pretty good, though
his chest does stick out too much, and it's hollow, so a side view of him
doesn't look nearly as good as a front view. And his still continues his
vehicle mode's schtick of having tons of weapons-- his double-barreled
gun is now handheld in this mode, and he now has little rotary machine-gun-like
details on his shoulders-- nifty! His missile backpack can lift up behind
his head for aiming, though this offsets his balance and makes it impossible
for him to stand like this. His head sculpt I have to admit I'm not fond
of, though. The large goggles on his forehead look too much like goofy
eyes, whereas his actual optic visor is black just like his forehead, making
it hard to discern where exactly his eyes are. Scattorshot has great articulation
in his arms-- he can move at the shoulders (at two points), and his elbows
are on ball joints. He can also swivel at the neck. However, his leg articulation
(or rather, his lack of it) is probably the toy's most annoying flaw--
he can only move side-to-side at the hips and knees, with no forward or
backward movement at all. This rather limits the posing you can do with
him.

    Scattorshot is a good
basic with a great
vehicle mode, even if he is small and has a severe lack
of leg articulation in robot mode. He's not the best the Cybertron line
has to offer, but he's far from the worst.

      Possibly the most neurotic Autobot ever
created, Scattorshot always gets the job done. As the right hand 'bot to
Jetfire in protecting Earth, he worries so much about messing up in front
of his legendary commander that he sets a nearly impossible standard for
himself. Despite his nervous clumsiness, he somehow never seems to fail,
but his good luck just serves as proof to him that somewhere in the universe
is a huge stone of bad karma just waiting for the right moment to come
crashing down on him.
