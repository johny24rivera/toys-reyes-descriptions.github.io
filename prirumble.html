    Rumble's vehicle mode
for the Prime line is a more "normal" alterante mode than the character
has normally had-- namely, it's a blue compact car with a spoiler. It's
a rather average-looking car (with the exception of the spoiler). The section
in front of the windows looks just a tad small proportionaly, but otherwise
Rumble's pretty well-covered in that respect in this mode. There's also
no robot mode extras to speak of. The mold detailing is fairly minimal
in this mode-- this is partially to give the car a sleek feel, with only
the wheel hubs and front grill having any particularly intricate mold detailing.
That's not what bugs me about this mode, though-- what bugs me is that
the body of the car is pretty much ALL light blue (the blue in person is
slightly less light than that in the pictures above, though). It's not
a shade you see naturally on a car, too-- there's no metallic shine to
it, it's just a plain color. Paint details are sorely missing from this
mode, with the front grill (and the headlights?!) being painted black and
the front bumper a nice dark metallic gunmetal gray, but that's it. Granted,
these dark colors contrast nicely with the light blue, but still... some
flames, or stripes, or even painted rear bumpers and taillights are missing
completely and really would've helped, here. The transparent cherry red
windows-- though not paint-- do help to break up the blue at least some,
though, and it's a particularly eye-catching shade of the color that, of
course, contrasts particularly well with light blue. Rumble comes with
two piledriver weapon accessories-- this mold's only real connection to
his traditional G1 persona. However, in a rather big negative for the weapons,
they don't actually move like they're supposed to-- each piledriver is
just one solid piece of plastic, so you can't have the drums slide up-and-down.
Rumble has two 5mm ports on the sides of his car mode to hold the piledrivers.
Given their placement, this sort of makes the piledrivers look like big
boosters in car mode, which is kind of a cool "second use" for them.

    Rumble's transformation
to robot mode mostly involves unfolding his limbs from the underside of
the car mode and spreading everything out, though there are a few surprises,
like the car doors going behind his back and the car roof halves sitting
on top of his shoulders. The end result looks VERY nice, and is definitely
the highlight of the toy. Rumble's proportions are rock solid-- he looks
quite like a muscular, stocky guy, with a wide chest and HUGE shoulders,
but with a relatively small waist and lower arms. There are a few vehicle
mode extras that don't quite fit in with Rumble's overall silouhette, though--
the sides of his car mode stick up quite blatantly from behind his shoulders
and can impede movement there slightly, though from a relatively straight-on
view they don't make themselves that obvious. The bigger issues are the
big chunks of the car roof on the sides of his shoulders, which just sort
of hang there unceremoniously (though on the plus side, THESE extras don't
impede movement). The mold detailing in this mode is great, with the relatively
undetailed car mode bits giving way to more intricate angular robot details,
particularly the excellent, unique designs on his chest, back, and waist.
(Really, the way his chest details are fitted, it almost looks like he
has a second evil face on his chest.) His headsculpt is also well-done,
having side antennae and a wide mouthplate, sort of like a wider, evil-er
version of Optimus' headsculpt. The transparent red plastic for his eyes
also works very well when it comes to light piping. Paint detailing has
(thankfully) been upped significantly in this mode too, with the gunmetal
gray detailing on his face and chest mixing in well with the blue and more-dominant
black plastic in this mode, along with a tiny bit of red paint to mix things
up a bit more. My favorite accent color is definitely the bright yellow,
though-- used in small amounts as it is, it helps this otherwise relatively
plain color scheme pop a bit where it's used on the shoulders, waist, and
knees. Rumble's articulation is quite excellent-- he can move at the neck
(at two points), shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), hips
(at two points), knees, and ball joints at the ankles to give him some
stability. Really, other than waist articulation, you've got pretty much
all you can reasonably ask for on a deluxe toy here, and his balance is
excellent, so he can get into a ton of nice poses. Rumble's 5mm ports are
on the side of the car bits on his lower back in this mode, so they're
not very accessible, but Rumble can hold his piledrivers (or other 5mm-compatible
weapons) in either of his hands in this mode.

    Don't let Prime Rumble's
rather plain vehicle mode fool you-- his robot mode is very distinct, articulate,
and just generally looks fantastic (a few minor kibble issues aside). The
added paint apps in said robot mode also look great too, though his vehicle
mode does show some bright spots in being kibble-free and proportional--
I just wish he had a few more paint apps in that mode, and that his piledrivers
worked. One of the best and most character-ful deluxe Prime designs, particularly
when it comes to the Decepticons. Highly recommended.

      Chaos and destruction are all that Decepticon
