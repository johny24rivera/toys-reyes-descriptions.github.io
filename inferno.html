    Beast mode is a fire
ant. His legs dont hold him up at all in this mode, so he tends to sink
to his belly. Also, his middle legs can break off easily, and his front
and back legs look rather awkward, since they are so much thicker than
his middle legs (they become his legs and arms in robot mode). However,
you can see parts on his engine in robot mode through his ant bulb, so
it makes these discomforts not so overruling. The detailing is only so-so,
but the articulation on this mode is very nice, as all six legs can move,
and his ant mouth and antennae can move as well.

    Robot mode is defintely
the best of the two. His face has a grinning, almost demonic look to it,
and he has two guns, a flame thrower and a missle launcher. His hands end
in claws, and his ant bulb opens up to reveal a revolving engine for flying.
His middle ant legs can get in the way some, as can his bulb engine, but
this is no big deal. The big deal is that the waist parts don't fit together
very well (at least not on my toy), and this is VERY annoying. A word of
caution; be careful when playing with this toy, as the ball joints may
eventually wear out, and then you have a collapsable heap of cool-looking
plastic parts.

    A pretty poor beast
mode, but an awesome robot mode.

      Although seemingly slow, this giant
ant's abdomen splits into separate quadrants to reveal hyper-drive ion
thrusters that propel him at speeds up to 180 mph! If he can't catch a
retreating Maximal, he detaches his rear leg missiles and fires them from
the secret launcher hidden within his power-pinching mandibles! The claw-like
pinchers also detach so Inferno can put the bite on enemies even in robot
mode, when his destructive powers are at their best!
