    Beast mode is a scorpion.
This repaint of
    <a href="scorponok.html">
     Scorponok
    </a>
    keeps all the same
features, including the exaggerated proportions, unfortunately. The stinger
looks way too big and bulky in proportion to the rest of his body, as does
his claws. His scorpion legs also look way too small. This is almost made
up for, however, by the extremely cool color scheme; the silvers and orange-golds
make this look a bit more like a real scorpion. The little action feature
in this mode is that, if you press up on a lever on his tail, his stinger
will swing forward, which is neat.

    Robot mode looks very
nice, although it still has the same exaggerated proportions of the stinger
and claws. The problem with Scorponok was that the spring that was used
to launch the cyberbee wore out after a while; this toy fixes that problem,
however, which is a nice pro. The other claw fires two missles when you
lift it, and while this is cool, can get kind of annoying, since you can
set it off pretty easily. The scorpion legs that hold this mode together
can wear out after a while, however, like all plastic does, and after this
toy is more than a few months old, the body and stinger seperate a little
too easily. Again, the color scheme works nicely with this mode, although
I think the "mutant head" looks better than the robot head.

    A nice transformer;
recommended over the original, if you want to spend the extremely expensive
price for it.

      Although Predacon in name, Sandstorm
seems to resemble a Maximal of old. A courageous commander of Predacon
resistance forces, Sandstorm demands nothing less than utter commitment
and total loyalty from his troops. He was instrumental in bringing together
the warring factions of the Maximals and Predacons against the tyranny
that inhabits Cybertron. His quick decisions and fair judgments are his
foremost attributes that instill respect from both Maximal and Predacon
alike. In both beast and robot modes, Sandstorm is paired with a cyber-bee
infused with the Spark of a deceased comrade. Sandstorm's weaponry includes
twin shock-concussion missiles which launch from his claws and a deadly
electro-arc sting which erupts from his tail, disabling any foe within
his immediate vicinity.
