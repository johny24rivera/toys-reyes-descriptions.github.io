    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Axe Attack Autobot Ratchet.

     , though there are some major differences. The stripes on his
sides are a bit thinner, and don't have the "heartbeat" sign that the mainline
toy had. He also doesn't have "AMBULANCE" written on his front, it's just
painted a near-solid red, along with the front bumper. Speaking of which,
I'm really not fond of said red bumper-- that just looks really odd. The
particular shade of red used for this toy is also a shade or two too bright,
darkening it down a notch would have helped, particularly in robot mode.
Also, one of the few deco problems I had with Rescue Ratchet-- the red
face-- is also present on Rescue Torch Ratchet, and it looks just as ugly
here. The white paint used on the red parts also isn't quite thick enough
to do the job-- it takes on a distinctly reddish tint, as the plastic shows
partially through it. Using, of all colors, BLACK for the plasma blast
missile piece is also a questionable choice. Still, the metallic color
used for the robot hands/face "tusks"/waist and the ambulance windows are
excellent choices, and overall the color scheme contrasts with itself quite
nicely.

     Rescue Torch Ratchet
is a definite improvement over Axe Attack Ratchet in terms of the overall
color scheme, though the mold itself still looks pretty weird in robot
mode, and a few of the color choices or their placements are a little off.
Recommended over the original FAB Ratchet, but if you're an older fan you
may want to spring for the mainline Rescue Ratchet toy instead.

       Autobot Ratchet is devoted to saving
lives no matter what form they take. He's decorated himself more like an
Earth rescue vehicle to make that job easier. Sometimes, though, saving
lives means acting as a warrior, rather than a medic, and that's why he
keeps his torch fueled not just for healing, but for battle as well!
