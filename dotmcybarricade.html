    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original movie Legends
class Barricade. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original movie Legends class Barricade

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     This time around, Barricade
has a more traditional police car color scheme, with white, black, and
a bit of blue being the primary colors. White is by far the most prevalent
color, though, which almost makes this Barricade an "inverse" of his normal
color scheme. The blue line on the bottom of his vehicle mode--which also
extends to his chest and arms in robot mode-- helps to add a bit of color
to it, and along with the black gives Barricade some nice dark colors.
He does have some silver on his headlights and the normal "POLICE" logos
on his car doors, though I wish they were a little darker to contrast against
the white better. Case in point: the dark metallic gunmetal gray paint
on Barricade's windows, which is a really spiffy shade of the color and
works both as windows and as another darker color. (Honestly, they should've
just used that color in place of the other silver paint apps.) There's
also a tad of light red used for Barricade's siren, taillights, and robot
eyes, but they're merely accent colors and aren't present enough to really
add much to the color scheme.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Barricade EXCEPT the presence of a peg hole
in his right claw-hand to hold Cyberverse-scaled weapons.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Even though he doesn't
appear in the movie like this, the solo release "Legion" Barricade has
a color scheme much more reminscient of most police vehicles, though in
my opinion that's a bad thing. The white just doesn't work as well for
such an evil-looking Decepticon compared with the black (which wasn't that
out-of-place to begin with on a poilce vehicle, of course, just not as
common in my experience). Also, though he has an adequate number of paint
apps in vehicle mode, his robot mode is a bit lacking in that department.
One of my least favorite releases of this toy so far, though it's still
a fairly good Legends/Legion class mold regardless.

       Barricade has been deactivated more
times than he can count, but it has all been in service to Megatron. His
leader gives him the opportunity to hunt, and that is all he asks. He will
gladly suffer a thousand deactivations, as long as he is given leave to
stalk
his prey.
