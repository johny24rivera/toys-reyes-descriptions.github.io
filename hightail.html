    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Lugnutz. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Lugnutz
    <a href="lugnutz.html">

    .)

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Hightail is a repaint
of Lugnutz, but he's a "repaint" only in the sense that
     <a href="cygfprime.html">
      Galaxy
Force Optimus Prime
     </a>
     is as well. Namely, a few color swaps and a few
paint apps have been switched around some, but it still looks really similar
to the mold's original color scheme. The black and gray of Lugnutz are
pretty much the same on Hightail, with maybe just shade or so difference.
The main change is that the light orange on Lugnutz has been replaced with
a dull red on Hightail that has just the slightest hint of orange in it.
Needless to say, though it's a noticeable color change, it's not ENOUGH
of one for a repaint. The spiffy gold flames on Lugnutz have been replaced
with a rather dull curvy silver line on the robot chest, which isn't nearly
as cool, if you ask me. A few other, more minor paint app changes have
been made, such as the new white paint apps on the waist, but these are
so minor as to not be very noticeable unless you compare the two toys side-by-side.
One really cool thing about Hightail, though, is that he's the first Transformer
(at least to my knowledge) to have his colors done after a sports team.
His license plate says it's from Cincinnati, Ohio, and the license plate
letters say "B-CAT 1". This is a nifty homage to the Cincinnati Bobcats,
who have the same team colors as Hightail-- more than a coincidence, certainly,
and pretty cool too.

     No mold changes have
been made to Hightail. However, the problem the back half had clipping
to his front half in robot mode has been solved in this iteration of the
mold.

    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Hightail is a lazy repaint
of one of the line's worst molds-- there's really not much to recommend,
especially since one of Lugnutz' few cool things about his color scheme,
the golden flames, have been removed for a plain silver curvy line. Unless
you're a big Bobcats fan, you probably should skip this one.

       Freedom. That's why Hightail came to
Earth. Sure he's an Autobot, but that doesn't mean he has to follow Optimus
Prime around like a puppy. Cybertron was just too small for him is all,
and the wide-open spaces and long-straight stretches of pure blacktop on
Earth are the perfect antidote. Hightail is happy to mind his own business,
cruising the back roads and byways of America, looking for the next filling
station where he can recharge and kick back with a cold can of oil. And
if he meets any Decepticons along the way, well, he'll send'em crying back
to Galvatron.
