    Bumblebee's Concept Camaro
alternate mode looks very nice, especially for such a small toy. The proportions
are almost spot-on, with the bottom of the car being only slightly bulkier
to accomodate the radio control electronics. Bumblebee also has quite a
few paint apps-- in addition to the "must-have" paint apps that are covering
his windows and car stripes, he also has silver wheel interiors, and his
headlights and tail lights are fully painted. Bumblebee comes with a handheld
gun-shaped remote controller which, when activated, can cause Bumbles to
roll forwards and backwards in vehicle mode. When he backs up, however,
he backs up at an angle, so he can do more than just go back and forth
in a straight line. The controller itself is actually pretty awesome, with
Bumblebee's main colors and a neat stylized version of his name imprinted
on the top of the handle, along with an Autobot symbol. He can also clip
onto the top of the controller in car mode when it's not in use. Like the
other RC Micro Racer Controllers, the tip of the controller can come off
so it can double as a pen, which is pretty awesome.

    Also like the other
Micro RC Racers, Bumblebee transforms in a very "Spychangerish" manner,
with his hood forming his really wide, broad chest, his side doors forming
rather skinny, flat arms, and the rear half of the car pulls out a little
to try to pass as legs, though Bumblebee doesn't have any real feet whatsoever.
His legs also barely pull out from his body at all, making him rather short
and fat proportionally, with no real upper legs and no discernible knees.
He also has the typical extremely limited articulation that other Spychanger-like
toys have-- he can move back-and-forth at the shoulders, but that's it.
One the plus side, though, his head design is very well-done and well detailed,
both mold-wise and when it comes to the paint apps. Plus, it's the only
transformable toy of Bumblebee that has his face mask down in robot mode,
which is a big plus.

    Micro RC Racer Bumblebee
has an interesting RC controller and vehicle mode going for him, but his
robot mode leaves a lot to be desired. If you really like RC cars, I'd
mildly recommend him as he's the best out of the three Micro RC Racers
in my opinion, but at $15 U.S. for a Spychanger-sized vehicle, unless you
fit into that category or you're a big-time completist you should probably
skip this toy, what with the plethora of other, better Bumblebee toys out
there.
