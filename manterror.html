    Beast mode is a mantis.
A well done mode, although his robot legs sort of stick out under his abdomen
and his insect legs are sort of small. The detailing is only so-so, but
the articulation is very good, as the wings, mantis arms, mantis head,
antennae, and mantis legs can all move.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Robot mode is freakish-looking.
His legs are normal size, but his arms are longer than his body! His insect
legs on his chest get in the way a lot, though, and his insect head antennae
interfere a bit, too. His disks in his mantis pincers are well done and
can fire far, and they can fold into the arms nicely. His robot head is
cool-looking, and very fierce.

    A nice robot, but some
extras in both modes. Only recommended for experienced transformers, though.

      The maniacal Manterror may seem awkward
in appearance, but he's a skilled fighter with devastating quickness in
both robot and insect battle modes. Having the power of flight and equipped
with razor-sharp raptor claws, he activates internal stealth silencers
to strike from the sky like a sizzling bolt of proton lightning. In robot
mode, he prefers to launch his devastating ion discs, which don't stop
spinning until they've sliced through a targeted enemy's external armor.
As he always says, "To face the Manterror is to face defeat!"
