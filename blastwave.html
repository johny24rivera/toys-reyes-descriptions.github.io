    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior Megatronus
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RID2015 warrior
Megatronus toy

     Blastwave shares the
same very general alt mode of Megatronus in that he's a futuristic tank,
but nearly everything from the waist up is a new mold; the tread portions
of the tank are kept the same, along with the upper arms and upper legs.
His whole look has been made a lot more "samurai-y", with samurai-like
segmented armor details on his waist, lower arms, and the new kneecap pieces
(the only new pieces on the lower portion of the body-- in vehicle mode,
these same pieces have holes in them for you to stick Mini-Con Weaponizers
or other weapons on them, compared to the little missile packs Megatronus
had). The shoulders have some tread-like details on the sides, along with
some half-circle details that help make him look more unique (with one
of them filled with his Autobot scan symbol). There's also some skull-like
details in two places-- the first is on the chest, which have what look
like two large yellow eyes for the pecs, with a small "skeleton nose" and
teeth over the abs. In vehicle mode, you still see this same "yellow skull
face" motif on the bottom of the main body of the tank, with similar "skeleton
nose" details that are just slimmer because of the proportions, along with
what looks like the center portion of the Decepticon symbol above said
"eyes". In fact, Blastwave's headsculpt looks
     <a href="rotfbludgeon2.html">
      AWFULLY
familiar
     </a>
     ... yep, this is a really obvious "pre-tool" for Bludgeon,
who came later in the year. I mean, a tank samurai with a skullface who's
NOT Bludgeon? It's an odd choice, but there might have been a miscommunication
about the mold changes-- on the show and on the box art, he still has Megatronus'
head, weapon, and the like, just repainted and with his chest remolded,
sort of like a "halfway" point in between Megatronus and Bludgeon, utilizing
parts of each different design. Instead the toy is just straight up Bludgeon
in different colors. His whole schtick is that he's an Autobot that looks
like a Decepticon in his one appearance in the show, though, so it still
     <i>
      mostly
     </i>
     works, except for the head. He has a samurai sword, which can be stored
in a port on the back of his head in vehicle mode or on either of the aforementioned
ports on the top of either of his treads. He also has a nice double-barreled
cannon, which pegs into the front of his tank turret or behind his upper
shoulders in robot mode. He can also wield it in his hands-- it's a pretty
cool accessory, and enhances his silhouette and makes it more unique in
both modes. The only piece of kibble Blastwave has that Megatronus doesn't
is that in tank mode, due to the design, the robot fists are fairly obvious
on the back of the turret, which is a bit oddly long due to the turret
design essentially being a "180" from how Megatronus' turret was oriented.
(The back of his head is also kinda obvious if you don't peg the sword
in above it.)

     Blastwave may look like
Bludgeon, but his color scheme sure ain't-- it's much more "military" in
its look, with a military dark green being used for much of his turret/upper
robot mode. He's also got a fairly dark blue on his faux skull "faces"
in vehicle and robot mode, as well as on his lower arms, kneecaps, and
some minor connector parts. His treads are a charcoal black, along with
a bit of paint of that color on his shoulders. All in all it makes for
a decent color scheme-- none of them clash to be sure, but they don't "wow"
me, either. With the number of paint apps and minor colors though, his
colors are broken up pretty well. He's got those aforementioned yellow
"eyes" on the "skull faces", which contrast well against the blue, and
there's some yellow stripes on his cannons, too. There's some white on
his skull-face, and some dull red on his eyes and shoulders. Finally, there's
some blah light milky gray plastic, but thankfully it's only really used
on his upper arms and legs and a few minor connector parts, so it's not
a huge deal. The hilt of his sword, his ankles, and almost his entire cannons
are painted silver, which pretty much always looks good.

     Blastwave is a bit of
a missed opportunity, likely due to some miscommunications somewhere along
the line in Hasbro. Mixing up more Megatronus and "future Bludgeon" parts
would've made him more unique, but with him using all the parts his future
repaint Bludgeon will, he just ends up looking like a Bludgeon in different
colors and not as his own character. This is unfortunate, as most of the
mold changes-- the "skull faces" on the chest and tank, the beefed-up shoulders,
the weapons-- are positive when compared to Megatronus. As a mold, it's
still merely okay, though. Get Bludgeon instead.
