    Beast mode is a velociraptor.
This mode looks VERY cool, and is a nice

    repaint. It looks like Dinobot was trapped in mud during a storm that was
raining blood. One of the nice features in this mode is the green eyes-
they have no pupils! This makes Dinobot look very much like a cold-blooded
killer- much more Predacon than Maximal. However, this mode suffers from
the same big complaint as the other original Dinobot and Grimlock; the
robot legs are clearly visible from any angle, and make Dinobot look big,
bulky, and awkward.

    Robot mode looks very
nice as well. His color scheme has become more brown than red now. There
are a few extras in this mode, such as the velociraptor arms and a section
of the tail on the back, but these do not get in the way much. His spinning
shield that is silver on the inside is very cool. One of the major problems
I have with this mode is his "mutant head"- it gets in the way a lot, and
it would have been a better toy if Hasbro had just forgot the darn thing.

    A very nice toy, with
few overall extras and a nice color scheme. Recommended over the original,
as this toy seems to be of higher quality than

    and the original Dinobot.

      As if torn from the pages of earth's
prehistoric past, a vicious velociraptor breathes again! But Dinobot is
no ordinary 'raptor, he's a robot in disguise battling beside his heroic
teammates, the Maximals! Armed with a spinning cyber-slash tail weapon
