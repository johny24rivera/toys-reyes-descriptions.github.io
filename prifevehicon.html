    Vehicons are basically
the Stormtroopers of the Decepticon army in the Prime show (though they
have even worse aim), and for this first outing of their design, their
vehicle mode is a very solid, angular sportscar that bears more than a
passing resemblance to the Batmobile. (I mean, with that rear spoiler,
and being primarily black and all, how could it not?) The proportions are
very stylish in this mode, fitting in well with the Prime aesthetic while
still being relatively realistic (though the hood should probably stick
out slightly more above the front section). In another big plus, the Vehicon
has basically no robot mode extras in this mode at all, though you can
just barely make out his robot waist if you look carefully enough inside
his front window. The color scheme is-- for the most part-- pretty simplistic
and dark in this mode, being almost entirely black with a few clear parts
(like the windows and headlights) and silver bits (like the wheel hubs).
What makes this mode pop more than it otherwise would are the really nice-looking
light purple paint apps along the front grill, front sides, and taillights.
There aren't many of them, but they really contrast extremely well with
all the black, and give the toy a more Decepticon-y color scheme, even
if it's a little touch. The Vehicon also comes with a small triangle-barreled
blaster weapon in this mode, which you can stick onto either side of his
front section as a little pop-out gun or store on his underside securely.

    The First Edition Vehicon's
transformation is borderline hard-- not so much because of the number of
steps, those make him qualify as "Medium" at best, with the only semi-difficult
part being the legs-- but because there's so many little "fiddly bits"
you're just not quite sure if you're done unless you have the instructions
in front of you. Many pieces-- like the small bits on his back, or on his
lower legs-- don't really plug in anywhere, and don't sit flush with the
surrounding parts, making you wonder if you've dotted every i and crossed
every t when it comes to transforming him to robot mode. Indeed, this is
the First Edition Vehicon mold's biggest drawback, that's it's so much
more complex than it needs to be, and throws off what should be a fairly
streamlined robot mode and instead makes it look a bit chunky and awkward.
For example-- what's up with the rear tires rotating down to be behind
his elbows? Not only does it look bad and interferes with his movement
there a little, but it's not show-accurate. The wheels are in the shoulders
on the show, which means that their default position when you transform
the Vehicon's arms are perfectly fine. His arms are also a bit too two-dimensional,
and the windshield bits on his lower arms stick out too much because of
this. His clawed hands also can't hold his weapon-- it does plug in slightly
below either of his hands, but this looks off. Pretty much the entire top
part of the vehicle mode also sits behind the Vehicon's back, making him
look bulkier, though at least it compresses somewhat and doesn't get in
the way of articulation much. His legs are the best part of this mode--
yes, they're a bit complex, but at least they do get those little "points"
of his front grill behind his knees, which is a nice little touch that
would've seemed impossible by looking at the show model. What does definitely
improve in this mode is the Vehicon's color scheme, with a pretty good
amount of dark purple and dark bluish purple on his chest, waist, shoulder
interiors, and knees, breaking up his color scheme a fair bit more to make
him more visually interesting. His face sculpt is slightly off from the
show-- the chin being a bit TOO small-- but otherwise it looks pretty good.
(It doesn't have personality, but that's sort of the point for Vehicons.)
His mold detailing stays quite angular-- particularly on his purple painted
parts on his chest and knees-- and enhances his "evil, stylized" look.
For articulation, the Vehicon can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at three points), inwards at the wrists, and at
the waist, hips (at two points), knees, and slightly at the heels and toes
of each high-heeled foot. He's pretty well-balanced, so you can get him
into many poses, though with his kibble and odd arms not a whole lot of
them look particularly dynamic, unfortunately.

    The Vehicon is one of
the few First Edition molds I would argue is definitely sub-par to the
"Robots in Disguise" release of the character. This version has a slightly
better vehicle mode, more show-accurate legs, and waist rotation, but fails
in terms of how much kibble is visible in robot mode, along with that mode's
general unappealing proportions and fiddly transformation. This, in combination
with how hard this mold is to get due to troop-building and its exclusive
nature (I had to get the Takara version of the mold, that's why I'm using
stock photos for this review), make me easily recommend the "Robots in
Disguise" deluxe over this version, unless you're a big troop builder of
this mold and just want something a bit different in design from your other
Vehicons.
