    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Arcee. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Arcee

     I think the Energon Arcee
mold has been repainted as an homage to pretty much every G1 female, now...
Still, no matter how many times they repaint this figure, they always make
it different enough from the others where each one is easily discernible
from the other, and Elita-One here is no exception. Instead of making Elita-One
pink and white like her G1 colors, they decided to make her vaguely reminiscent
of her G1 self, making her a pinkish bronze and light gray-- a very good
choice, as it makes her different enough from G1 Arcee's colors yet still
close enough to her original colors to make you go "Oh, yeah I see it now"
if you're told it's Elita-One. The colors themselves go very well together,
though the light gray admittedly looks rather dull compared to the silver
and metallic pinkish bronze. There's not too much of the light gray to
make Elita-One look anywhere near dull, though, so no problems there. The
silver doesn't contrast well on the light gray, however. It does look REALLY
good against the pinkish bronze, though, especially the silver "Z" stripes
on the upper legs. Elita-One's transparent Energon parts made been molded
in a charcoal black-- they go quite well with the other colors, but a pure
black would have looked a little better, I think.

     Elita-One is one of
the slightly weaker repaints of the Energon Arcee mold overall, but that's
more of a testament to how well this toy's color schemes have been than
Elita-One's actual color scheme itself. If you find the
     <a href="targetarcee.html">
      blue
Arcee movie repaint
     </a>
     of this mold I'd pick that one up instead, though
it IS nice to finally have a toy of Elita-One after all these years, even
if it is just a repaint.

       As the first of the female Transformers
robots, Elita-One gets a lot of attention, and loves every minute of it.
It isn't just her incredible handling, or her fast idle that gets the attention
either. She's a cunning fighter, and one of the best marksmen among the
Autobots, able to blast Scraplets off a Decepticon at more than four miles.
At short range, she's just as effective, generating an attraction field
that can cause unshielded robots to overheat almost instantly.
