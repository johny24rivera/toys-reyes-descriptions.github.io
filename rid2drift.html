    Drift is another main
Autobot character in RID that has a sportscar for an alt mode, but for
visual diversity he's more of a roundish sportscars, instead of being all
angle-y and edgey like 'Bee and Sideswipe. In car mode, it's difficult
to really see anything wrong with Drift; the proportions are pretty darned
solid and show-accurate, and there are ZERO robot mode extras or even hints
of extras. As with most RID2015 toys the mold detailing is fairly minimal,
especially in this mode, given the streamlined look of most sportscars.
Mostly it's the barebones basics, but there is some interesting detailing
on the front grill, with Drift's headcrest present to help "link" the front
to Drift's robot mode head and it also just makes for a nice faux car brand
crest. There's also some angular ridges on the front grill, though most
of it is in black plastic where you'd can't see much of it, unfortunately.
In fact, that's my issue with this mode, which is a common issue with RID2015
toys; not enough paint. The basic colors are orange and black-- a nice
color combo, and actually from Drift's original concept art in
    <a href="aoedrift.html">
     Age
of Extinction
    </a>
    , so it's nice to see them put on some version of the
character. The black is fairly well-spread over the front and sides of
the mode, and the windows are transparent plastic, but tinted so black
that you can't see anything in them-- which, in my opinion, is how you
should do windows on TFs if you can't make the interior look realistic.
However, the back third or so is completely bereft of any paint, with the
rear window not painted, nor the rear taillights. (In fact, the rear end
does look a bit odd with the backs of the black feet making for odd black
blocks in the middle of this back end.) The front area has some black paint,
the aforementioned red crest, and some nice light metallic silvery blue
paint for the headlights, but that's it. Comparing it with the show model,
he should also have red lining his transparent black wheels, some gray
on his front intakes, and red on his rear-view mirrors. He does have a
red stripe along each of his side doors, but it's rather skinny-- it's
much wider and thicker on the show. Drift's two swords peg in quite securely
underneath his side doors in this mode, so no need to worry about obvious
weapons.

    Drift's transformation
is quite simple-- you basically just unhook the arms from the side, fold
the hood down onto his lower legs like with
    <a href="rid2bee.html">
     warrior
Bumblebee
    </a>
    , and then rotate his rear body around and unfold a couple
of small parts. The end result is a rather broad-shouldered, large-footed
Transformer, but one that still looks fairly good in a stylized way. The
arms are the least show-accurate part of him, with the curved front sides
of the car mode obvious even though in the show they're more rectangular
armor pieces with no wheels shown. His arms also aren't as thick as on
the show, are black instead of orange, and in said show model he don't
have car doors hanging off of them. On another minus, the hood sections
on the back end of the lower legs are another obvious extra, but they don't
get in the way of movement much and his legs are already rather thick without
them, so they don't bother me all that much. I feel similarly about the
little flap behind Drift's head, which forms the front grill of the car
mode. Although the lower legs are definitely too large with proportion
to the upper legs, this is the case (though to a bit of a lesser extent)
in the show, so I can't fault the designers all that much here either.
The "core body" of Drift looks very good, with some nice black stripes
on his flip-down chest piece (albeit without blue headlights molded in
or painted on, unfortunately), some nice "armor hip skirt" pieces that
can fan out slightly, and a nice headsculpt that combines elements of his
original
    <a href="drift.html">
     "G1-ish"
    </a>
    headsculpt with his AoE headsculpt
and giving it all a beard. His headcrest is also painted red in this mode,
with some gray on his face, blue eyes, and a nice thin black line down
the sides of his face, to emphasize where the samurai-like "armor" around
his head meets his actual face. I wish the beard was painted, though. As
with the vehicle mode, Drift is definitely missing some paint in this mode,
though it's not nearly as bad this time around-- the orange and black are
broken up much better in this mode, it's just that beyond the head, the
only robot-specific paint apps are black stripes on the chest and black
on the kneecaps. Everything else is carried over from vehicle mode. He's
missing several small-and-medium-sized red paint apps all throughout his
body when compared with the show model, which is a shame because the red
both complements the orange and contrasts against the black. For articulation,
Drift can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at three
points), a bit inwards at the wrists, waist rotation, movement side-to-side
at the hip skirt pieces, and movement at the hips, knees (at two points),
and back-and-forth at the ankles. Thus he's fairly poseable since his mass
is distributed quite evenly. In addition to his swords being able be held
in his hands (as you'd expect), they can also sheathe into slots on his
left piece of hip armor, which is a nice feature.

is, quite obviously, the toy you want if you want a well-articulated version
of the character complete with weapons. The car mode is nearly perfect--
only missing some paint-- and the robot mode is quite well-done too, but
some of his simpler toys (especially his larger simpler toys) actually
have more show-accurate robot modes, so if accuracy matters more to you
this may not be the version of Drift for you, despite being a pretty nice
mold overall.
