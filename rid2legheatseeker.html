    Heatseeker is the only
of the RID2015 Stunticons to get his own toy solo, as he's the only one
who had a fair amount of screentime to himself at the beginning of Season
Three. Anyways, Heatseeker's alt mode is a heavy-duty 4WD SUV, and for
the most part this mode is pretty show-accurate, with the only exception
being that the front hood portion is a bit TOO wide. However, this may
be because of the transformation at this scale-- if they were to make it
skinnier, perhaps the shoulders would've been too weak in robot mode. Anyways,
the kibble in this mode is basically non-existent. On the back end you
can see the upper legs in between the taillight details-- basically there's
no "middle" to the back end-- but they don't stick out at all and, given
the scale, this is more than acceptable, in my opinion. Heatseeker's mold
detailing alternates between smooth areas-- like much of his front hood--
and some detailed areas, like the "teeth" on his front bumper, three headlights
on each side of said bumper, a fair number of angular lines (for the size)
around the windows and roof, and his wheels are treaded, as well. Color-wise,
Heatseeker could certainly do better-- most of his plastic is that very
blah, light milky gray shade. He's got some black on his wheels, though,
and thankfully he has a fair amount of paint in this mode. There's a really
nice shade of dark metallic purple used on his headlights, some metallic
gunmetal gray on the bottom area of his front bumper, and a fair amount
of fairly dull red used for his front and side windows, as well as some
angular designs on his roof and car doors. (That said, his red paint apps
don't extend to the rear side window areas molded on the toy, which looks
odd if you look at it closely.) Other than a few more paint apps on the
"teeth" on his front grill or taillights, he's pretty well-painted overall.

    Heatseeker transforms
very similarly to
    <a href="rid2legstrongarm.html">
     Legion-class Strongarm
    </a>
    ;
fold out the back ends to become his feet (and rotate up his little roof
pieces to become his feet), separate the front halves and rotate them down
to become the shoulders, then fold out the arms from the sides. The end
result is a buff-lookin' bot, though again, his shoulders are just too
darned wide, even keeping in mind the "look" he's supposed to have. Beyond
that proportional malady, though, he has no major pieces of kibble in this
mode-- the bits of the windows behind his shoulders are meant to be there,
and help enhance his silhouette a bit as well. Yeah, his lower legs are
a bit bulky too, but this largely fits with his model and keeps him pretty
steady. The long flat feet also help in this respect, too. His fists are
molded into the inner areas of his lower arm/car door pieces, but they
look pretty good for the size and help taper his arms down to a more "manageable"
size articulation-wise. His upper legs are black, with some angular details
on the knees. His head, chest, and waist are where most of the new detailing
is in this mode. There's some basic shapes on the pelvis and what looks
like a crumpled car front for his chest, but his head is really where the
unique detailing is. He's got a "normal" black eye and a circular blue
"zoom eye", along with side "ear-like" antennae, a rounded head with a
vent in his forehead sticking up, and a "normal" face with white paint.
Unfortunately, despite how unique it is, the detailing on the face is "off"
a little bit, with the eyes being off-position compared to each other and
looking a bit too simple and overly cartoony. Still, all the detailing
on his chest and waist looks great, and there's some white paint on his
lower arms and abs, as well as some more dull red paint on the faux window
on his chest. For articulation in this mode, Heatseeker can move at the
shoulders (at two points), elbows, hips, knees, and slightly at the ankles.
The way his arms are proportioned makes them a bit difficult to pose naturally,
but otherwise his articulation is pretty good for a Legion-class figure.

    Legion Heatseeker is
a pretty solid little Transformer, with good articulation, proportions,
and a nice amount of paint for the size. His only real weaknesses are having
a boring main plastic color and overly wide shoulders/front hood pieces.
Normally I'd recommend this version the most if you want a toy of this
guy (especially if you don't care about the combining aspect), but this
toy is very difficult to get, part of a wave of toys that only made appearances
in Australia and a few other countries. Thus he may not be worth the extra
cost for such a small toy.
