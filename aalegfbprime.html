    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RotF Legends class Optimus Prime

     Fireburst Optimus Prime
shares the color scheme of many late-RotF Optimus Prime repaints in that
the main change from his traditional scheme is that his cab nose is now
gray instead of red. And, just like those other late-RotF Prime repaints,
it's not an improvement over the traditional color scheme. The white milky
gray has just been waaay overused by this point and is bland besides. However,
the shade of red used for the flame paint apps on the front is a pretty
cool shade, and contrasts well with the gray-- too bad it's not used more
often. The dark blue is also a particularly nice shade, having a nice metallic
tint to it, and goes well with the silver paint apps. Unfortunately, the
blue is largely in the same place it was on the original release of this
mold.

     Given that his only
major change is taking away most of his red and replacing it with a bleh
light gray-- and that he doesn't have any unique paint apps to make him
stand out from other Prime repaints-- this is my least favorite color scheme
that this mold has had. Only recommended for Prime completists-- otherwise,
get one of the more colorful, eye-catching versions instead.
