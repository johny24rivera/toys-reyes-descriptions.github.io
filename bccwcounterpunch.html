not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Breakdown.

     It's no longer Punch/Counterpunch--
it's just Counterpunch now. The story is that he was severely damaged,
and the Punch parts had to be removed. Reusing the
     <a href="cwwheeljack.html">
      Wheeljack
     </a>
     mold fits Punch/Counterpunch pretty well in vehicle mode, less so in robot
mode. I mean, you're essentially taking Punch/Counterpunch's signature
gimmick and removing it (although you are adding in combining at the same
time, to be fair). Stil, Counterpunch's colors are replicated quite well.
His main colors are black and a fairly dark (but not super-dark) blue.
It's just a SHADE lighter than the blue on
     <a href="bcbluestreak.html">
      TFSS
Bluestreak
     </a>
     -- it's definitely close enough where they complement each
other as teammates. By itself these colors would be rather dull, though,
so thankfully the windows on Counterpunch (both the real windows in vehicle
mode and the "fake" chest windows in robot mode) are painted silver, which
adds a little bit of "light" to the color scheme. There's also some light
red on the wheel hubs and the sword-- it looks quite nice against the black,
in the small amounts it's used. The black paint on part of the rear "shaded
windows" of the vehicle mode is a nice touch, too, though black headlights
are bizarre. In robot mode the most interesting paint apps are the really
nice light purple, silver, and lime green paint apps on the knees, which
partially replicate details on the G1 toy (I really wish these colors had
been used more on the toy, G1-accurate or no). There's also a bit of bright
orange on the shoulders, which is accurate to the G1 toy as well-- a bit
of "Punch" showing through Counterpunch's robot mode, so to speak. A bit
more of Punch has been added, though, and that's the hand/foot/gun-- it's
all a bright safety orange (the paint on the top is a glossier shade than
the orange plastic used for the actual fingers, but it all looks good together).
This is for the arm mode, called "Punch" mode (Get it?!), but it still
makes for some excellent contrast against all the dark blue and black in
any of Counterpunch's modes.

     Counterpunch has a new
headsculpt, apparently already made for the mold by Hasbro but never used--
hence the odd choice to make Counterpunch his own character, as the headsculpt
had already been made (not quite sure what
     <i>
      Hasbro
     </i>
     was thinking there,
though). It's a spot-on headsculpt for Counterpunch, with good proportions,
crisp detailing, and a silver visor with a black helmet. No complaints
here. Besides the headsculpt, Counterpunch also has all the changes made
to the base mold that CW Wheeljack has.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     CW Counterpunch is an
interesting idea, and the "Punch Mode" is good for a nice laugh, but I
think this is definitely the weakest of the Wreckage combiner components.
Even ignoring that you got rid of the thing that made Punch/Counterpunch
unique-- and that FunPub already made a
     <a href="bcpunchcpunch.html">

     -- the color scheme is generally dull, particularly in vehicle mode.
He has a few nice paint apps on his knees in robot mode and on the wheels,
and the hand/foot/gun is a nice bright color for contrast, but for a FunPub
figure he's relatively bland and could've used a bit more paint.

       The Doublespy known as both Punch and
Counterpunch had been deep undercover for so long, even he had begun to
question his true allegiance. After millions of years, the false history
of his undercover persona had been burned into his datatracks, becoming
indistinguishable from his true memories. Eventually, Punch and Counterpunch
had each come to believe that the other was a disguise.

       After a ruthless squad of Decepticons
discovered his dual identities during a raid on an Autobot base, he was
savagely beaten, labeled a traitor, and left to rust. However, thanks to
a talented medic from the planet Paradron, he was saved, but only by removing
the damaged components of his Punch form-- including the barriers between
Punch and Counterpunch's mental processes. Reborn as a single entity, Counterpunch
seeks to uncover the truth of an identity hidden within two conflicting
sets of memories. His brutality has been tempered by a constant struggle
between the Decepticon he thinks he is, and the Autobot he thinks he may
be. An outcast among the Decepticons, he has chosen to fight alongside
Impactor's new Wreckers, using upgraded versions of his original photon
cannon and twin mortar launchers.
