not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Voyager Evac.

     What's the opposite of
a space gun? A rescue helicopter, it would appear! Yessir, now the Shattered
Glass "opposite universe" character Galvatron has a toy-- one where he's
the
     <i>
      good guy
     </i>
     leader! The color scheme is pretty much straight from
G1 Galvatron-- purple, black, and light gray are the main colors here.
The gray is a bit on the blah side, but there are few large unbroken areas
of it on the toy, and it doesn't have that dull milky look to it that many
other light grays used in Transformers do, so it's not that bad. The three
colors certainly contrast against each other well enough, though the light
red used as an accent color really helps to give the scheme that extra
little pop. There's also some silver and light blue to even things out,
along with a few light orange decals on the side of the vehicle mode. One
is a "LIFE FLIGHT-1" decal-- obviously referring to the fact that he's
now a rescue helicopter-- while the other looks like a stylized, simplified
version of Galvatron's four-pointed "crown" on the top of his head, surrounded
by a circle and underlined. It's a rather unique little symbol.

     No mold changes have
been made to Shattered Glass Galvatron-- and that's mostly what makes him
so awesome. I NEVER would've seen Evac as a mold so fitting for Galvatron,
but it works VERY well, particularly for a "good guy" Galvatron. The chest
and head look practically identical to G1 Galvatron's with the right paint
apps, as do the legs, and the rope-winch hanging off the right arm mimics
G1 Galvatron's gun.

     Shattered Glass Galvatron
is a great mold with a pretty good paint job, but the real selling point
for this toy is just how well they were able to take an existing toy and,
without any mold changes, make it fit a completely different character
so well. Definitely recommended if you're into Shattered Glass.

       After his brush with death and subsequent
rebirth, Galvatron became an even wiser and more compassionate leader of
the Heroic Decepticons. He uses his new powers and alternate form to manage
the battle against Prime's forces on both Cybertron and Earth. His chemical
laser cannons have a range of two miles and his hook-and-grapple is supposed
by a nigh-unbreakable destronium tether.

       It has been a full solar cycle since
Nexus Prime and Aquarius left Cybertron for parts unknown, and the Stellar
Spanner built by Alpha Trion subsequently destroyed. However, some strange
energy readings coming fron inside Iacon seem to indicate the technology
may be in use once again...
