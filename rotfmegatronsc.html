    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Leader class
RotF Megatron toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Leader class RotF Megatron toy

     The bad guy always looks
good in black, so why not Megatron, too? A bit more than just being a "just
black" redeco, though, Shadow Command Megatron mixes it up a bit with some
other colors that haven't really been found on other primarily-black TFs
before. The other main color is a really nice shade of silverish-bronze.
It's plastic, but it's a creamy, glittery shade that makes it look rather
metallic, and it serves as an excellent main contrast color against the
black. The silver paint also looks quite good too, and the addition of
metallic bronze and orange on a few highlight areas really help make this
toy look like it's made of "metal" for the most part. To keep ol' Megs
from looking too monochrome however, a bit of red has also been added here
and there as a highlight color, which needless to say goes very well with
the black, particularly on such appropriate areas as his thrusters.

     No mold changes have
been made to Shadow Command Megatron, but his electronics have been changed.
The phrase you hear when you press down on the lever in his chest now says
the movie line "There is no command but mine!". In addition, moving his
large right arm around makes a firing noise on this release. The color
of the blinking lights is still appropriately red.

     Shadow Command is an
excellent redeco that outshines the original in every way (well, every
way a redeco CAN, at least). It's an excellent "evil" color scheme, but
with enough originality that makes it more attractive than your average
black redeco. Easily recommended over the original RotF Leader Megatron--
though the mold is still sadly mediocre at best.

       Landing thunderously among his assembled
warriors, Megatron strikes the ground hard enough to shatter stone, calling
his army to order. He has come here to renew his purpose, and to reclaim
his right to lead the Decepticon army. For too long the Decepticons have
been shattered, either fighting as individuals or cowering in hiding. It
is time that they all remembered that the word of Megatron is absolute,
and no desire exceeds his will.
