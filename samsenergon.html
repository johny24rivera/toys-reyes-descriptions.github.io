now he has a blue crane arm and waist piece instead of having them colored
orange. Woopity woop woop woop-- he's so similar to his previous versions,
it's not even worth the webspace to put up pics of this hardly-different-at-all
repaint. Hardly a well-thought-out toy, though at least the colors go okay
together. But still, Longarm really needs to go beyond being primarily
black...

          Egads, ANOTHER Prowl!?
Give the name a rest already, Hasbro! Well, name aside, this is a pretty
good repaint, and the best color scheme this mold has had so far. The blue
and white go VERY well together, and the gold, black, and red are great
secondary colors. Some of the internal robot colors-- such as the legs
and arms-- are the same colors as that on Powerlinx Red Alert, but it's
not so much that it's impossible to ignore. Most of his paint apps are
also the same as Powerlinx Red Alert's, but with different colors like
gold, and that almost always is a good color. There are a few paint apps
that differ, though; for one thing, Autobot symbols have been added to
the sides of the vehicle mode instead of a rescue deco, and they look pretty
nice. The English writing used on part of Powerlinx Red Alert has also
been replaced with Japanese writing (I have no idea what it says, sorry--
I'd imagine "Police" or something like that.) But it is a nice tie in with
the deluxe Energon (NEW mold) Prowl, as he has Japanese symbols on him,
too. So overall, a decent repaint, even if not all of the colors have changed...

            Energon Zapmaster isn't
too different from Armada Swindle, but a lot of the colors have been switched
around, so I figued a quick pick of the vehicle mode would help visualize
what the new toy looks like now. I don't like the red wheels at all-- they
look gaudy-- but otherwise, the red, black, and gray go together fairly
well. Still a crummy mold, though, and he really needs more paint apps...

              This repaint of Armada
Starscream is made to look very similar to

               Energon
Starscream
              </a>
              , at least when it comes to the color scheme. And it works
very nicely-- it's darker than Armada Starscream's, making the toy look
a bit more evil. The black, gold, red, and gray work wonderfully together,
and some of the wing paint apps are brand-new-- certainly a rarity for
a bargain-priced exclusive toy. I'm not all that fond of the ghastly blue,
but it's used sparily, and it's a nice nod to the fact that Energon Starscream
is an "energon ghost", so I can still see why it was used. So despite the
fact that this is the fifth time that this mold has been used, it's still
different enough from its previous versions to be considered worth purchasing,
especially since it's at a bargain price. It's really quite a good repaint.

               The Sam's Club two-pack
is an excellent buy at just $23 for two Megas- you basically get the second
one for just $3! And both of the main toys are pretty good repaints, themselves--
a rarity among bargain store exclusives, to be certain. Recommended if
you have a Sam's Club membership and don't have any of the previous versions
of these molds-- otherwise, mildly recommended.
