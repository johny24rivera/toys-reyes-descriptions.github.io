    Ironhide's vehicle mode
is a black GMC Topkick pickup truck-- you know the drill by now. Proportionally
he's pretty much perfect in this mode, as you'd expect from a TF with a
licensed vehicle mode, particularly one at this large scale. There's a
fair bit of robot parts sticking out below the bottom, though, which is
made a bit more obvious by the fact that these robot parts are dark greenish
blue compared to Ironhide's almost entirely black truck mode. Even from
a somewhat top-down diagonal view, you can still see the heels and bits
of the knees hanging down below. They don't interfere with rolling, but
just barely so. Ironhide has clear front and front-side windows, though
his rear-side and rear windows are unfortunately just details on plastic.
You can see some of the robot parts through the clear windows-- namely
parts of his weapons and fists-- but nothing that's particularly distracting,
thankfully. Although Ironhide has most of the "necessary" paint apps in
this mode-- like the front grill, GMC logo, 4x4 logos, and the head and
taillights-- there are definitely some parts that still should have been
painted, like his rear side window details, step rails on the sides, and
the like. His wheels may not look painted, but they actually are upon closer
examination-- they're a rather rich metallic shade of black, which makes
them look a bit "oiled up" and honestly quite cool. Although he doesn't
    <i>
     appear
    </i>
    to have weaponry in this mode, he actually does, and they're both pretty
cool reveals. Pull back on his left smokestack, and a copper-tipped blaster
pops up through that side of the roof; pull back on his right smokestack,
and a rotary blaster pops up on that side of said roof (both can be deployed
at once); very nifty! If you press down on a small button near the rear
window, Ironhide will also emit a "truck idling/driving slowly" noise.

    Ironhide's transformation
to robot mode-- while not exactly basic-- is more simple than you'd expect
from a Leader-class toy, particularly given how relatively complex his
Voyager-class toys have been. What you end up with has some definite pluses
and definite minuses. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. For
one, a fair amount of vehicle mode bits (like his windshield and front
bumper) simply hang behind his back-- and though they don't flop around,
they don't peg in anywhere and can be a bit distracting from a side view,
as well. There's also quite large chunks of his roof hanging off the bottom
of his arms, and although they do have a place to peg in, they come un-pegged
QUITE easily and tend to flop around during play-- this is definitely the
most annoying aspect of this toy. He also doesn't really have heels to
his feet, and although you can bend him forward a bit, he falls backwards
a bit more easily than I'd like. His gimmick-cannons are now on his lower
arms in this mode, and though they can be deployed just as easily, they're
a bit under-sized proportionally in this mode and thus not as impressive.
On the plus side, Ironhide has some GREAT molded detailing in this mode,
particularly on his legs, where all manner of "greebly bits" like springs,
pistons, and the like are visible everywhere. (This is made even more obvious
by how relatively "bare bones" his vehicle mode is in this department.)
The fact that his lower body is mostly dark greenish blue-- while not really
movie accurate-- does give him some needed color variety in this mode,
and you can definitely tell that this mode is where most of the paint apps
were focused. Little bronze and silver paint apps abound, with no one area
being too one-tone in this mode. His chest and head assembly is also VERY
accurate to his movie model, feels solid, and looks great. (It should be
noted here, though, that during transformation, the ball joints that the
sides of his chest are on can pop off extremely easily-- a bit of annoyance,
but only during said transformation.) Both of Ironhide's legs contain hidden
weaponry, which you can unveil by opening up the sides of said legs as
the weaponry itself turns/lifts itself out of the widening gap in a rather
nifty manner. His right leg contains a hidden spring-loaded missile launcher
gun (which he can detach and hold in his hands, if you so choose, or it
can be fired right from his leg, as opening up the panel it's concealed
in makes it face forwards), while his right leg contains a knife that can
also obviously be attached and held. Now THAT'S making some good use out
of "empty" space! Ironhide's central electronic-based gimmicks are also
quite cool-- press in on the silver bit on the upper part of his chest,
and his eyes will flash green and his mouthpiece lowers a bit while he
says either "Ironhide here!" or "Weapons Ready!" in a close-but-not-quite
Ironhide imitation voice. Best of all, if you press down again and again
on the large gray tab behind the right side of his head in a "revving"
motion his whole STOMACH opens up to reveal a big rotating chain gun! His
eyes flash green and the top barrel of the gun flash red while this gimmick
is activated, and a "chain gun firing" sound is emitted as he does this.
Talk about an awesome hidden weapon! As for articulation, Ironhide can
move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), hips (at
two points), knees (at two points), and at the ankles and at the mid-point
on each foot. It's certainly servicable, but at this scale I'd appreciate
things like waist articulation or at least head movement. His wrists should
also be able to swivel-- there's no transformation reason why they couldn't.

    Dark of the Moon Leader
class Ironhide is an Ironhide for Transfans with a specific taste. If you
like big, (relatively) simple transformations with a ton of fun gimmicks,
this is definitely the Ironhide for you. However, if you like more complicated
transformations, less kibble, and/or lots of posabliity, you're better
off sticking with one of the various releases of the
    <a href="movironhide.html">
     orignal
voyager class version
    </a>
    of this character (which, admittedly, I find
to be a better deal as a voyager than this Ironhide is as a leader).
