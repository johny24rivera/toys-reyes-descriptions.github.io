    Bumblebee's old '70s-era
Chevrolet Camaro alt mode is pretty much spot-on proportions wise. The
colors are also spot-on Bumblebee, with black and yellow being the primary
colors. I've never been a fan of yellow, but it's so associated with Bumblebee
that it would be weird if he WASN'T almost all yellow, so as long as fits
the character... The windows are painted a nice color that fits in well
with the yellow-- some are rather bothered by the fact that he doesn't
have transparnet windows like in some of the early prototypes of this figure,
but I don't mind, as I actually prefer painted windows if there isn't a
full-fledged detailed interior-- otherwise, you just see robot parts inside,
which hardly makes for a convincing vehicle mode. I also think it's pretty
cool that the ends of the missiles double as the exhaust pipes on the rear
end of this vehicle mode. The main problem I have with this mode, however,
is that it's just rather dull. There's very little detailing on the main
body of the vehicle, and there really needs to be more paint apps on the
figure, both in this mode and in robot mode. The stripes help some, but
three little black spray apps don't really make the illusion that Bumblebee's
a beat-up old car clear enough. Some silver-and-brown rust spots or something
here and there really would've helped.

    Bumblebee has two different
"automorph" features in his transformation to robot mode-- the first involves
his hood swinging down and his headlights popping out slightly on his robot
chest to look more like his chest does in the movie. This automorph can
get stuck rather easily-- be careful, regardless of whether you have the
"defect" version or not*. His other automorph feature is rather cool--
when you move his robot feet downwards to their correct position in robot
mode, the panels on the backs of his legs slide upwards and out of the
way. Bumblebee has pretty good articulation in this mode-- he can move
at the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and elbows, and about
half of those are on ball joints so you can get a good range of motion
out of him. Some of the vehicle mode kibble sticks out a bit too much and
is obvious in this mode, though, like the windows and front windshield
behind his upper back and the pieces of his car mode on the sides of this
arms and upper legs. His appendages are also a bit too skinny, especially
his arms. The mold detailing on Bumblebee's robot parts is excellent, though,
especially on his face, which is covered in detail. As mentioned before,
though, he really could use a few more paint apps, especially on his appendages.
As for Bumblebee's action feature, he has two spring-loaded missile launchers
that he can either hold in his hands or can be mounted on his shoulders.
(I wish the yellow used for the "missile fire" pieces were a different
color besides just the same yellow used for most of Bumblebee, though.)

    Bumblebee is a rather
average toy, with a somewhat boring vehicle mode and a decent-looking,
if skinny, robot mode. Still, he's a fairly fun toy, and certainly not
a bad one. If you're only getting one Bumblebee figure, though, wait and
get the

      Sent to Earth by Optimus Prime ahead
of the other Autobots, this tough robot's job is to do what he does best;
gather information, find the keeper of the secrets of the AllSpark and
remain hidden. Bumblebee works best in silence and solitude, acting as
an unseen guardian over his assigned target. Don't let the fact that he
likes to remain hidden fool you though - when it comes to a fight, he rushes
in, both plasma cannons blazing!

      *NOTE: Later releases of this figure have a rather fatal flaw-- the
tabs that hold the "automorph" feature in place in vehicle mode are too
thick, and are prone to snapping, though it's not a foregone conclusion
that they will. If one of the tabs under the front hood is thicker than
the other, be extra careful during the first stage of transformation from
vehicle to robot mode! If the tab snaps, Bumblebee won't be able to transform
back into vehicle mode!
