    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Botcon Glyph. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Botcon Glyph

     I'm honestly amazed it
took Hasbro this long to reissue G1 Bumblebee. Of course, he came first--
way before Botcon Glyph-- but since that toy was utilized for a Botcon
2002 exclusive which was the first time I encountered this mold, you'll
find my thoughts on the design itself in that review. As you'd expect,
Bumblebee is almost entirely a dull yellow, with black poking through on
his robot bits, like his upper legs and arms, as well as on his windows
and rubbery tires. There's some chrome silver on the hubcaps, as well as
on both sides of the little square thing that pops out from the back end
of the vehicle to become his robot head. It's a pretty basic color scheme,
but it still works, particularly for a toy this small. He's got more paint
apps than your average Minibot-- some light red on the taillights, silver
on the front headlights and bumper, and some silver on his face and light
blue on his robot eyes. Like the other G1 Wal-Mart Minibot Reissues, Bumblebee's
face has actually been resculpted for this release, to fit his G1 cartoon
appearance better. It's a pretty good headsculpt given the toy's limitations--
all of the necessary details are there, from the little horns to the vent
on the middle of the forehead to the rather wide face. No complaints there.
For stickers, all Bumblebee has is an Autobot symbol on the top of his
vehicle mode/chest of his robot mode, and a "spare tire" sticker detail
on the back of his head piece that is visible in vehicle mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Even though beyond the
headsculpt change this reissue technically doesn't have any mold changes
compared to the original, compared to my original review of this mold as
Glyph, the small changes made to the rear bumper for the keychain have
been of course been eliminated, as well as the keychain itself.

     If you're going to pick
up G1 Bumblebee, it's almost assuredly for nostalgia purposes or to get
the original design of one of the most popular TF characters ever. The
toy itself isn't really going to wow anyone these days, and there's certainly
been many, many versions of the character that have done him better since
then. Still, there's something about having the original that hearkens
back to the original series in a way no other G1 "update" could, and if
you're one of those collectors, by all means get the toy-- just don't expect
much out of the toy itself, especially given its very subpar robot mode.

       Small, eager, and brave, Bumblebee acts
as messenger and spy. Due to his small size, he dares to go where others
can't and won't. He idolizes the bigger Autobots, especially Optimus Prime
and Prowl, and strives to be accepted. He is the most energy-efficient
and has the best vision of all the Autobots. He can go underwater for reconnaissance
and salvage missions. Although physically the weakest Autobot, his stealth
more than compensates for this inadequacy.
