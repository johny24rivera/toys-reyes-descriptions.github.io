not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Shattered Glass Ultra
Magnus has his color scheme based mostly on Powered Convoy, the original
color scheme used for G1 Magnus' toy back in the pre-G1 Diaclone days--
so, if you cover up the purple Autobot symbols on his side windows and
perhaps get him a new head, you can repurpose him as that character if
you're not so crazy about Shattered Glass. His primary colors are a moderately
dark glittery blue and black. There's a fair amount of silver and red paint
applications too to help give his overall color scheme a bit of a "lighter"
touch to it, though, and for the most part everything goes together well.
I wish the red were a TOUCH darker, but that's about it. To help give Ultra
Magnus' vehicle mode a bit more "zazz", some red tribal patterns have been
added on the front hood along with a silver stripe down the middle, but
despite having such small details as the roof-mounted headlights intricately
painted, ultimately it leaves the entire back half of this mode bare of
paint apps except for the wheel hubs AND the same color as the front half,
and it still is a little boring-looking. In robot mode he has considerably
more varied paint apps and his colors are broken up a bit more, so he looks
considerably better there. Such details as the silver on the upper legs
and abs, the black on the waist and lower arms, and the triangular patterns
on his knees really help make the toy in this mode look a "touch above"
what you'd find in a retail store in terms of the sheer number of paint
apps.

     Ultra Magnus has a new
head sculpt, though it's not one Fun Publications (the folks who run Botcon)
created-- rather, it was one of the alternate heads created initially for
the mold, but was just never used until now. It's definitely an Optimus-looking
head, but with one important difference-- his face is a skull! This is
a REALLY nice "evil" touch for an Optimus head, and the decision to make
the skull portion out of clear plastic with blue eyes makes it look even
more spooky and a little ethereal. In addition, Ultra Magnus has the same
"tab fix" on the shoulders that all releases of this mold except the initial
have; namely, one of the tabs is no longer large enough to prevent full
shoulder articulation.

     Shattered Glass Ultra
Magnus is a pretty interesting idea, and a way to get a more articulated
"version" of Powered Convoy out to those who want it. He has quite a few
paint apps in robot mode, though my main complaint is that his vehicle
mode looks a tad boring, particularly in the back section where it's nearly
bereft of paint apps. The ghostly skull face is definitely the best part
of this remold, though. Recommended over the original Autobot Alliance
deluxe Optimus Prime, though all other redecos of this mold beat this version
out, in my opinion.

       Ultra Magnus shouldn't be happy. He
lost his face and freedom due to a failed attempt to replace his brother
Optimus Prime as leader of the Autobots. His co-conspirators in the coup
betrayed him. His old rival, Treadshot, seeks his death with ceaseless
vigor. Magnus shouldn't be happy... and yet he is. Things are finally going
to be exciting again. After centuries of quietly manipulating events from
his exile on Paradron, everything has fallen into place. Now he has everything
he needs: an army, the legendary Terminus Blade, a copy of his brother's
newly-augmented body and the means to make everyone pay.

       An unrepentant hedonist and libertine,
Magnus eventually seeks greater thrills and excesses from life. Now jaded
and bored, he finds his distractions where he can, whether it be in Treadshot's
assassination attempts, in the humiliation of his brother, or in simple
universal conquest.
