    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 Jetstorm.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RID2015 deployer Drift

     "Scorch Strike" redecoes
for RID2015 are basically how the character should blend in in a desert
environment. This is Jetstorm's sole release by himself, and not packaged
in with deployer Drift. (Unfortunately it's a rather hard-to-find assortment.)
The body and lower arms of Jetstorm are the plastic color that Hasbro uses
for gold when they don't want to use paint-- it's kinda gold, but it's
a dull, milky brownish gold. It's a pretty decent color, but it doesn't
compare with gold paint. The other main color on the base figure is a fairly
straightforward tan, which both complements the gold since it's in the
same area of the color wheel, but it also contrasts pretty nicely since
it's so much lighter. For paint, Jetstorm unfortunately only has some on
his face-- his face is silver, his eyes are a fairly light blue, and a
pale dull yellow on his headcrest that honestly would've looked better
if it was a brighter, more vibrant color. A few more paint apps on the
rest of the toy also would've looked good-- particularly on the chest or
legs, it would've helped to break up the main two colors a bit. Jetstorm's
armor pieces on this release are a transparent orange-- not quite the fiery
orange as on the original version of this toy, but still a pretty nice
shade. That said, a lighter orange or something red would've worked better
on this scheme, as the orange armor blends in a bit too much with the other
main colors-- more contrast was needed.

     Scorch Strike Jetstorm
is a decent desert-themed redeco, though having the armor being a better
shade of plastic or having more paint would've marked it up a few more
notches in my book. However, without a Scorch Strike version of either
of his buddies
     <a href="rid2slipstream.html">
      Slipstream
     </a>
     or deployer
Drift, he feels like part of an incomplete set. Only recommended if you
only want the mold without deployer Drift for some reason (or if you're
a completist, of course).
