    *2018 UPDATE/BUYER BEWARE: After several
years, the dull gold plastic on Torca has shown reports of severe Gold
Plastic Syndrome (crumbling). Be aware of this when purchasing this toy.*

     Beast Mode is a FREAKY
gold elephant with a blue back and an orca whales mouth. He also has a
a whale's teeth, and an elephant's tusks, as well as a tailfin and fins
on his front legs. No extras in this mode, except the robot head, which
is somewhat visible if you open up the mouth too wide. He looks pretty
nicely done, although a bit disporportional- his front legs are a bit longer
than his back legs.

     The robot mode, however,
is different. He looks like a knight transformer.  The face looks
pretty neat, but there are lots of extras in the back, including his tail
fin and stomach flaps. His hands are also poorly designed, with his feet
attached right on to them, instead of folding back. His weapon is a little
fin "squirter"- fill it up with water, than push the fin forward to squirt
a little spray of water out its nozzle.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     A good toy in beast
mode, but not very striking in robot mode.

       A grand and wise warrior, Torca commands
immense respect from his fellow Maximals. Well versed in most combat techniques,
Torcas agility is excellent both on land and in water, surprising considering
his gigantic size and power. His massive tusks can be used to trap enemy
Predacons, making close quarter combat against him practically futile.
In both beast and robot mode Torca can access a dorsal gun which fires
spark-diminishing spray, temporarily paralyzing enemy circuits. Impenetrable
armor hide and unmatched power sufficiently discourage Predacon poachers.
