    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Waspinator Transmetal.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Waspinator Transmetal

     The Fox Kids' repaint
of Waspinator Transmetal is very nice. The color scheme fits that of a
wasp quite a bit better than the black-and-gold color combo of the original
Waspinator Transmetal. The yellows and blacks fit together extremely nicely.
I especially love the transmetal black, it has an "oily" look to it. Because
he looks so much like the original Beast Wars toy
     <a href="buzzsaw.html">
      Buzzsaw
     </a>
     in this mode, many Transfans have dubbed this repaint "Transmetal Buzzsaw",
and it fits. However, the improved color scheme still does not make this
a very good toy. No mold changes were made to the repaint, although the
ball joints on the insect legs seem a bit tighter then the original's.
But this could just be my toy. This toy is still a rather mediocre mold,
with quite a bit of extras, especially in robot mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Still, because of the
improved color scheme, I recommend this toy over the original paint job
of Waspinator Transmetal. Just remember it's a mediocre toy to begin with,
and you won't be disappointed.

       After the quantum surge, Waspinator
became a meched-out, armored wasp with the ability to change into a fighter-jet
as well as a bio-genetically enhanced robot. His personality, however,
did not change much; heÂ’s still high-tempered, aggressive and dangerous
when angered. Only now Waspinator is faster, armed with a toxic stinger
and more driven in his mission to wipe out the Maximals forever!
