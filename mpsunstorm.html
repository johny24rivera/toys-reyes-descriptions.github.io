    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Masterpiece Starscream.

     Given that this mold
was used for
     <a href="mpacidstorm.html">
      Acid Storm
     </a>
     , the logical next
choice would be another of the more obscure Seekers, Sunstorm. Sunstorm's
Masterpiece deco-- for the most part-- follows his normal color scheme,
being mostly yellow and white with some red accents (the paint apps on
the stripes on the wings really pop against both the yellow and the white).
The yellow on Masterpiece Sunstorm, however, is noticeably lighter and
less of an orangey shade than on most other releases of the character.
Generally I feel this works on this large of a toy-- these days, having
a large toy be mostly "cheese yellow" brings to mind one of the many large
Bumblebee toys, so I'm glad they went with a slightly different direction
in this case. The shades of metallic bronze and silver on places like his
thrusters and guns helps to add some much-needed darker shades to his bright
color scheme, and standard stuff like his clear plastic cockpit and black-and-clear
stand look pretty decent as well. The other parts where Sunstorm departs
from his traditional colors, though, don't fare as well. The worst is the
milky brown that's mostly prevalent in robot mode. Particularly on his
head, this just doesn't fit with any of Sunstorm's previous iterations,
and doesn't mesh all that well with his general "themed" color scheme,
either; this should have been replaced with black as it traditionally has
been, both for better contrast and particularly since this is the "Masterpiece"
version of the character. Having brown in these areas almost makes him
look like he's trying out to be a McDonald's mascot. Sunstorm's big paint
app in vehicle mode, on the other hand, was a nice idea-- a nice, large
bunch of curly "flame" paint apps along his main body and wings. However,
in practice these flame paint apps are far too close to the shade of yellow
plastic they're on, to the point where they don't really differentiate
themselves enough to really be distinct from the yellow (they pop out in
pictures much more than in real life)-- it blends in too much, which is
really a bummer as a bunch of genuine metallic gold flames (instead of
yellowish gold) would really have looked boss on this toy.

doesn't have any mold changes made for him specifically, though he does
have the same alternations that
     <a href="mpthundercracker.html">
      Masterpiece
Thundercracker
     </a>
     has. The mold is degrading quite noticeably at this
point from over-use, as well; his tailfins fall off all the time in robot
mode, and often parts of his chest/wing assemblage are wobbly and will
come off during transformation. They can simply be clipped back on, but
it's mighty annoying at this point. They seriously need to re-cast this
mold.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Masterpiece Sunstorm
does the same basic "sunny, flamey" theme of the character quite well,
but a couple of odd choices-- like the brown in robot mode and the usage
of a bunch of paint for flames that are just an ever-so-slightly different
shade than his main yellow plastic-- make him less of a home run than he
otherwise would've been, particularly when you add in the QC issues. Seeker
completists will probably like this, but otherwise it'd probably be best
to pass on this toy and get one of the versions with a better color scheme.

       Fly too close to the sun and you'll
get burned. Get too close to Sunstorm, and you'll be dissolved into a puddle
of liquid scrap. The maniacal warrior's radiation-emitting armor has the
power to melt the metal of nearby bots, disabling their circuits and scrambling
their brain module in the process. Some might say this is a quirk of science--
a glitch that triggered a reaction when Sunstorm was forged. Sunstorm himself
would say it's something more: a gift from a higher power that he must
use on those who deserve to feel his wrath. That might be a little much,
but, do you really want to argue with him?
