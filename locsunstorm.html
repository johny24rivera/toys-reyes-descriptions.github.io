    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Starscream.

     Sunstorm is the only
Legends of Cybertron toy that doesn't have a larger, mainline Cybertron
version, though the concept is based off the increasingly popular light
yellow G1 Starscream look-alike of the same name. The colors picked for
this version of Sunstorm are VERY well-done. Though I usually don't like
yellow being used as the dominant color for a Transformer, in this case
it looks very good, and is enough of a dull, "sunny" color that it doesn't
look too bright or tacky. The metallic orange used as a secondary color
is of a very attractive shade as well, and goes GREAT with the yellow.
The pearly white and silver are nice accent colors, and give Sunstorm more
of a feeling of power than he otherwise would have, at least to me-- which
is appropriate, considering Sunstorm is supposed to be a super-powerful
character. And, as expected, he still does have the black head (and a few
other minor black paint apps) to help identify that he is one of the many
Seeker Starscream look-alikes.

     No mold changes have
been made to LoC Sunstorm.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     LoC Sunstorm is a step
above Starscream in terms of the color scheme with some very nice-looking,
eye-catching colors all around. And, given that this mold is the best LoC
mold of them all, if you're only going to get one toy from this line, get
this one. Especially since there's no larger version of it in the main
Cybertron line.
