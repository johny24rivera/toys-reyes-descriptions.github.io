    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Speed Dial 800. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Speed Dial 800

     Ooo, a Decepticon cell
phone. It looks like, for all intents and purposes, Wire Tap is the "evil
twin" of Speed Dial, with a traditionally eeeevil color scheme of black,
red, and silver. Original? Certainly not. Good-looking? You bet your fanny.
Black, red, and silver go together extremely well together on almost any
toy, and this one's certainly no exception. The accent color of metallic
reddish bronze, which is used on parts of the robot face and the lower
arms, also looks REALLY nice, even ignoring how well it contrasts with
the black. I wish they used that particular color more often, it's good-looking
enough that it certainly deserves more use. The stickers used for the "cell
phone screens" also look really nice too-- being dull orange and black,
they definitely give off a very evil vibe, and look great with the surrounding
colors.

     Wire Tap V20 is an awesome
repaint of the rather dull Speed Dial 800, with the always-great-if-not-entirely-original
"evil repaint" colors, some nice paint apps, and really well-designed stickers
used for the cell phone screens. Recommended the most out of the versions
of this mold-- this is as good as this toy's going to get.

       Wire Tap V20 is a master code slicer
for the Decepticons. No matter how tough the encryption, no matter how
tight the security, Wire Tap V20 will find a way through. Hes a genius
at compromising peoples computer systems. Wireless carrier waves allow
him to remotely access your computer from the other side of the house,
emptying bank accounts, cracking government code, and filling your browser
history with compromising links. With him in your house, nothing is safe.
