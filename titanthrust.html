    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War Within

     Thrust's color scheme
is certainly very... Thrust-y. Really, it's a redeco of a Starscream mold
in colors based on G1 Thrust, the remold of G1 Starscream. Not really much
of a surprise here. The dull reddish brown remains Thrust's signature color,
with the silver and black coloration really looking well against it. Add
in a bit of the nice metallic gold used for the cockpit windows, optics,
and lower legs and you've got a Transformer who'll fit right in on a wooden
bookcase. He's got a pretty good amount of paint apps, too, so no worries
there-- silver and black stripes sweep across his form in a fairly impressive
manner. Unfortunately, where Thrust fails to really live up to his namesake
is in robot mode. No remold into a conehead here, folks-- he's got Starscream/Thundercracker/Skywarp's
head, so he doesn't really look like G1 Thrust in terms of that detail.
Also, Thrust, like his other Target exclusive wave brethren, doesn't come
with his own stand, despite costing $5 more than mass-release 6" Titaniums.
Kinda of a downer, that.

     Unless you're a big
Seeker completist, there's really no reason to get War Within Thrust. Although
his color scheme is pretty good, and his number of paint apps is fairly
impressive, it's been done before and will be done again. Plus, no head
remold minus the Titanium 6" stand plus $5 U.S. cost.... go for War Within
Skywarp instead, or maybe

       Thrust is a bully, not a soldier. With
the other Decepticons at his side, hes as courageous as they come, charging
into battle boasting of the victory to come. Even when he and his comrades
have their opponents outnumbered, however, he always picks the smallest,
weakest target to attack. Hell never fight an enemy his own size, and
will come up with any excuse to avoid a fight hes not certain he can win.
He is a coward, through and through, with nothing but a bad attitude and
a loud mouth to support him.
