    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics deluxe Bumblebee.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics deluxe Bumblebee

     Given their similarity
in design, a repaint of Bumblebee in Cliffjumper was inevitable, and it
looks quite good to boot. The red, black, and gray coloration is a great
color mix in robot mode, especially the red, which is a very nice-looking
shade. However, the car mode would have been somewhat dull without adding
in all those super-spiffy silver paint apps. They're certainly not realistic,
and I wish they had been used in a less haphazard pattern-- I can't tell
if they're supposed to simulate rust or just be decorative-- but they still
look pretty darned cool. The metallic light blue is also a really neat-looking
color, and is a great color for the jet ski and robot optics especially.

     No mold changes have
been made to Classics Cliffjumper. I can understand why they didn't remold
the head, since Bumblebee's and Cliffjumper's G1 heads looked so similar.
Still, even different colors don't keep the head from giving off a decidedly
more "Bumblebee" than "Cliffjumper" vibe. I think it's the wider proportions
of the head, though at least the head mold has a chin block, which G1 Cliffjumper
had but G1 Bumblebee didn't. Also, all of the Cliffjumper toys have the
same larger chest block on which the allegiance rub symbol is, so that
the rub symbol sticker doesn't peel off over time. Only later-run Classics
Bumblebees had this.

     Classics Cliffjumper
is an awesome repaint with some great paint apps and complementing colors
(especially the silver and metallic light blue). His paint apps may be
a tad more tacky in vehicle mode, but they work. Overall, I'd recommend
Classics Cliffjumper over Bumblebee any day.

       Don't be fooled by his small size: Cliffjumper
is as tough as they come. Always spoiling for a fight, just hearing the
word Decpticon is enough to get him riled up. He carries a unique gas-pistol
that fires a cloud of nano-robots capable of making Decepticon armour as
brittle as glass, but he'd almost always rather just toss his weapons aside
and start swinging. More than one Decepticon warrior has ended up with
a busted grill from underestimating Cliffjumper. He may not be very strong,
but no one is more determined.
