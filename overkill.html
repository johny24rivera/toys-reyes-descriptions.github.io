    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Grimlock. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Grimlock

     Overkill is a definite
homage to his G1 persona, who was one of Soundwave's lesser-known cassettes
who transformed into a ceratosaur. This repaint makes Overkill a t-rex--
basically a ceratosaur minus the nose horn, for all intents and purposes
here-- but keeps the general color scheme of dull white and pale light
navy blue. The colors contrast against each other somewhat well, but Overkill
really needs a genuinely dark color to help offset all the light colors.
He has some silver and translucent yellow accents, but both of those are,
again, light colors, and though they don't look horrible, they don't look
great either. Still, it is accurate to the G1 toy, of course, so I can
hardly blame them for this. But even ignoring that, he needs a few more
paint apps to help break things up. The blue-colored spine in beast mode
looks cool, but more paint apps are needed on the sides of the T-rex mode
as well as the feet. Either that or needed a few more different colors
to help break up up the two main colors-- either way, he just looks dull.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Overkill's
color scheme isn't horrid or loud or anything, but it does have a pretty
"blah" feeling to it when compared to the other two versions of this mold,
and needs a larger variety of paint apps and/or colors to make the scheme
really work. This, plus the fact that he costs more than Classics Grimlock
due to his exclusive nature, makes me only recommend him to completists
or big dino fans.

       Formerly bound to Soundwave as a partner
and slave, Overkill was often overlooked by enemy and ally alike. Recently,
however, he has overcome his diminutive size, reinstalling his cerebro-circuitry
in a larger, more dangerous body. Now, he is free to indulge his destructive
whims, stomping cars flat, snapping tractor trailers in half in his jaws,
and being generally terrifying.
