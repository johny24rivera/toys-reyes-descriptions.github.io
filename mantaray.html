    Beast mode is a manta
ray, obviously. One of the first things you notice when you look at Manta
Ray (He has no real name; therefore, he is referred to as Manta Ray) is
that his robot legs stick out and are very noticeable in this beast mode,
even from a view directly above. This was very poorly done. Also, there
are no points of articulation (with the exception of those used for transformation)
in this mode. Although they could of made his manta ray top look cool,
they made it look very dopey, with huge, emotionless eyes and rounded fins.

    The transformation to
robot mode is ridiculously easy. Just flip his head back and turn him around.
Even though the idea behind transforming Happy Meal Transformers, which
are made for little kids, is not to make it too hard, this toy carried
that point too far. In robot mode, he looks a little better, but not much.
His rounded, dopey-looking fins still stick out, and his chest looks a
bit too large for this mode. His arms are decent looking, though, along
with his legs.

    Very crummy in both
modes- they could have made this robot look a lot better than they did.
