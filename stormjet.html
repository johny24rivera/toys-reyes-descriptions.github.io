    Mold History
   </b>
   : Storm Jet's mold was
originally used for the deluxe version of Beast Machines Jetstorm, which
came out back in 2000.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to deluxe Beast Machines Jetstorm.

     Storm Jet has an uncreative
name, but a creative color scheme. Despite it only really being made up
of three colors- red, black, and white- the colors remain scattered enough
throughout the entire toy that it seems like he has more. Thus, I really
think this toy has enough color detailing as is. The color scheme is also
nearly identical to an old Transformer from 1984, called Jetfire. A very
nice toy, and using a color scheme to sort of hint back at it is a nice
touch. It's also oddly fitting for this toy, although a bit more of a darker
color scheme- perhaps a bit more black- would have been a bit better. One
thing, though- the black paint on the upper arms tends to stick, so be
careful when you transform Storm Jet if you haven't transformed him in
his while- if you're not, his arms may snap off from the stickiness of
the upper arms. On the upside, though, the missile launcher problem in
Deluxe Jetstorm and
     <a href="saj.html">
      Sonic Attack Jet
     </a>
     seems to have
been fixed- no longer do the missiles fire when you don't want them to
That's always good. Another thing worth nothing is that Deluxe Jetstorm
and Sonic Attack Jet's Vehicon spark crystal has become just a solid red
sphere on Storm Jet. I would have preferred an Autobot spark crystal, but
Hasbro did admit that these were rushed out a bit to fill the end of the
line.

     No changes have been
made to Storm Jet mold-wise from his predecessors, so he remains the same
in that area here.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Overall, Storm Jet's
a pretty sweet deal, if you can find him (he's only packaged one per case).
He has a couple of odd little quirks, though, such as his sticky upper
arms, that he doesn't quite come up to Sonic Attack Jet's quality. Also,
his color scheme could be slightly more varied than it is.

       Storm Jet is capable of flying at very
high speed and loves to chase down Decepticons who think they are faster
than he is. Although he has a stormy temper, he manages to control it most
of the time, but woe to the Decepticon who pushes him beyond his patience.
He conducts reconnaissance missions, deftly avoiding any missile attacks
if he's spotted by the enemy.
