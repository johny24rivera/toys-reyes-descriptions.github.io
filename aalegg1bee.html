    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the "G1" Universe 2.0 Legends
class Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the "G1" Universe 2.0 Legends class Bumblebee toy

     "Gold" Bumblebee here
is actually an homage to G1 Goldbug, who was himself an "upgrade" of the
Bumblebee character. I imagine why he's simply called Gold Bumblebee here
is both for copyright reasons and for name recognition. Anyways, Gold Bumblebee
certainly lives up to his name, as his main color is a dark, metallic shade
of gold. If I were to be absolutely nitpicky about this I would've liked
the gold to have been just a TAD lighter, but it still looks magnificent
as a main color. The black used as the color for the windows and wheels
serves a dark neutral color, while in robot mode a dark glossy blue is
revealed that goes quite well with the gold AND the black. However, those
are pretty much the only colors for Gold Bumblebee-- his face and headlights
are painted silver, which looks quite nice, but I wish there was a little
more of said silver simply to get enough of a real "light" color in there.
Because he's a "Reveal the Shield" toy, Gold Bumblebee has an allegiance
symbol on his chest/roof, which appropriately shows an Autobot symbol if
you rub it with your finger.

     No mold changes have
been made to Gold Bumblebee-- as much as I would've liked for him to have
gotten that faceplate that Goldbug had...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Gold Bumblebee is a
pretty nice-looking redeco of the Legends "G1" Bumblebee mold, both in
terms of being a nice homage to Goldbug while still having a variation
of Bumblebee's main color so that kids who didn't have the original wouldn't
have had much trouble using this toy as "just" Bumblebee. His colors are
definitely an improvement over the original's, though I wish his gold had
been a tad lighter (or he had had a few more silver paint apps) to make
everything pop just that much more.
