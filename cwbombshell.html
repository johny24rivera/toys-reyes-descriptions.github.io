    ,
Bombshell is the next G1 Insecticon to get the Generations Legends class
treatment. In insect mode, he looks remarkably accurate to his
    <a href="g1insecticons.html">
     G1
toy
    </a>
    , but more insect-like and less, well, "vehicle-like". He has actual
insect legs instead of legs-on-wheels, and his general proportions show
a definite thorax and a definite abdomen. The hallmarks of Bombshell's
insect mode are still kept intact, though including the large yellow shoulder-"eyes",
the long multi-pronged antennae, and having a back half that's honestly
a bit too short proportionally for such a bug. The color scheme is also
carried over pretty well from his G1 version, but with a bit more "spicing
up" and generally a more varied color scheme-- yes, he does have black,
yellow, and purple as major colors (but no chrome-- I'm fine with that
part, but boo on replacing it with that blah light milky gray plastic.
Ah, well, at least it's not a dominant color). The shade of purple is an
attractive, milky shade of dark purple, and goes well with the black--
though if those were the only colors, Bombshell would look too dark. Luckily
he's got a pretty good number of paint apps, with a yellowish gold on the
front section and some nice red vents and detailing on the back half. (The
sides of the back half are also painted black, in a sort of "half-attempt"
to color that section like his G1 toy-- I like the purple more, though.)
The mold detailing is pretty intricate in some parts-- the insect legs,
in particular-- but overall it's not QUITE up to the standards of most
other Legends figures, with most of the detailing being either the bare
essentials or a few extra circuitry lines here and there. A bit of a nice
surprise is that Bombshell has two 5mm-compatible handles on the back end
of this mode-- given the whole "Combiner Wars" theme, it's not hard to
see him being held like a gun in beast mode by a combiner, so that was
a completely unneeded but nice little extra touch. For articulation in
this mode, Bombshell is rather restricted-- his back two legs on each side
can move up and down a little (as one piece), and his antennae can move
at one point, but that's it-- I was hoping for a little more, honestly.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Bombshell's transformation
is remarkably simple, even for a Legend-- you basically just unfold his
legs, turn them around at the waist, fold out the arms, and then turn back
the antennae to reveal his robot head. It's a plus for a quick, simple
transformation, but the downside to this is that pretty much all of his
details from insect mode are visible in this mode (mostly on his chest
and lower legs), so the two modes look a bit too same-ish. (Granted, this
is similar to how his G1 toy looks, but I still wanted a bit "more"-- a
few unexpected twists and turns, like on Skrapnel.) Thus, my comments on
Bombshell's robot mode are a bit sparse in comparison, other than that
his proportions are generally solid (and a bit unexpectedly curvy). The
5mm handles look decent enough as "kneecaps", and I like that Bombshell's
fists-- while still havimg 5mm compatible holes in them for holding weapons--
have little cannons on the front of said fists, giving him some (imaginary)
firepower. His headsculpt is pretty spot-on, with some evil beady litle
red eyes and a knight-like faceplate, though I wish his antennae had a
more elegant manner of folding behind his upper back or something. For
articulation, Bombshell can move at the shoulders, elbows, waist, hips,
and knees (slightly restricted because of the pegs on the front and the
insect legs interfering a bit with backwards articulation). I wish his
head could move, but at this scale I suppose that's not really reasonable,
given his transformation. Most of these joints are ball joints, so he can
pull off some nice poses, and given the size of his feet and the insect
leg "heels" behind them, he's pretty stable as well.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Combiner Wars Bombshell's
a great little simple toy and a nice update of the G1 character, with a
good number of paint apps-- it's only because of how excellent and detailed
his predecessor Skrapnel was that I am, in some cases, disappointed in
him (particularly in terms of the relatively simplistic mold detailing
and transformation, relatively tiny insect legs, and really bulky lower
legs). He's still a recommended purchase, and a great addition to your
Decepticon army-- I just wish he fit in better stylistically with Skrapnel.
