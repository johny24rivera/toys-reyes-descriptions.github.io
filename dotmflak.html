    Flak's alternate mode
is a mobile artillery vehicle. Proportions-wise, this mode is pretty spot
on (while making sure it's not close enough to an actual military vehicle
to make Hasbro pay for the rights to use it, of course). It's a pretty
solid block, with only a slight gap in the middle of the rear end-- otherwise,
in this respect, this mode's perfect. The detailing is very well-done and
everywhere, as you'd expect on a vehicle like this; vents, armored windows,
and even little ladders on the side are molded in, which is quite impressive
for this small of a figure. The color scheme of dark military green and
tan is, of course, VERY fitting for a military vehicle, and there's enough
tan paint apps in this mode to break up all that dark green quite well,
so Flak doesn't look boring or anything. There's also a little black used
for things like the windows and wheels. The one bummer thing about this
mode is that the turret can move up and down and rotate, but because of
the transformation, the center of rotation is definitely off on one corner,
making most poses with the turret that aren't pointing straight forward
look a bit odd.

    Flak's transformation
is pretty straightforward and mostly par-for-the-course when it comes to
a Legends/Legion figure, but it results in a rather substantially different,
nice-looking robot mode. I love how a fragmented portion of Flak's vehicle
front forms his chest and stomach in this mode, and how the turret rotates
over his right shoulder to still be of use here, as well as give his silouhette
a bit more individuality. The shoulders poke up a bit TOO far above the
shoulders for my liking, but otherwise his arms look pretty decent for
the scale. His legs are a bit restricted articulation-wise, unfortunately,
both due to having no knees and being rather long, somewhat bulky segments
of the sides of his vehicle mode. He has a bit of a backpack made of the
top of his vehicle mode as well, though the only place this becomes a bit
unsightly is in between his legs; otherwise it blends in with his main
body pretty well. There's a bit more dark green in this mode, and I would've
liked to have seen a bit of silver paint detailing on his feet and hands
to break up the dark green a bit more there, but it's not too bad. I am
not fond of Flak's headsculpt, though-- it's well-painted, with light blue
eyes and a silver face, but it's one of those movie heads that just looks
like they tried to fit in too many "greebly bits" in the detailing and
it largely ends up looking like a bunch of nothing in particular (though
because of the paint apps, it IS clear he has two eyes and a faceplate).
For articulation, Flak can move at the shoulders (at two points), elbows,
and hips, as well as up-and-down on his turret cannon. He's pretty par-for-the-course
among
Legion class figures in that respect.

    Dark of the Moon Flak
only has a few minor flaws (the off-center rotation of his turret, overly
tall shoulders, some minor proportional issues with his legs), and is one
of the best Legion-class designs out of the DotM Cyberverse subline-- perhaps
because there wasn't a complex CGI model it had to emulate at this small
of a scale. Highly recommended if you're into these little figures.
