    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Hulk. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Gray Hulk is, as you'd
expect, a repaint of the original green Hulk in gray. Luckily, they didn't
JUST do it in gray, though, as that would be a very boring-looking toy.
Gray Hulk's got a very nice dark blue color as a secondary color, and it
looks very good, particularly in robot mode where it's more apparent. The
metallic gunmetal gray on the treads is also a pretty nice-looking color,
though it obviously doesn't contrast with the gray much. Unfortunately,
particularly in tank mode, Gray Hulk just doesn't have nearly as much color
contrast or exciting of a color scheme as this toy's original release.
He doesn't have nearly as many paint apps as the original crossover Hulk,
for some reason, and most of the paint apps he does have are in black or
gray, which hardly provides much contrast to the already predominantly
gray color scheme. As I mentioned earlier, the blue helps some, but there's
not enough of it, and few blue paint apps to help contrast against all
that gray.

     Crossovers Gray Hulk
is still a great toy and a great mold, but his color scheme-- while not
outright bad-- is rather boring compared to the original Hulk, not to mention
less iconic since we're talking about the Hulk here. I'd recommend the
original Crossovers Hulk toy over this one for all but the biggest Gray
Hulk fans.

       This mech suit was built specifically
to match the power and rage of the Hulk. Its armor is indestructible, like
the shield of Captain America. Its hydraulic joint flexors absorb the HulkÂ’s
energy, so that the battle suit becomes stronger as the Hulk gets angrier.
In vehicle mode, a powerful sonic cannon knocks other mechs to the ground,
and scrambles their audio sensors.
