    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Rattrap Transmetal. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Rattrap Transmetal

     The Fox Kids repaint
of Rattrap Transmetal has an overall lighter coloration than its predecessor.
This can be good or bad, depending on the toy, but in this case, it's a
step down. Rat toys need to have darker color schemes, since they are creatures
of stealth. A light red coloration does not fit Rattrap nearly as good
as the original dark brown. Still, it gives this toy a fiery appearance,
so if you're imagining it as a different character, it can work rather
well in this aspect. One can easily imagine this toy wielding fire-related
weapons. The transmetal black contrasts with the red and gray rather nicely-
transmetal black can do no wrong, in my opinion. The light green and tannish
brown, especially prominent in robot mode, do not fit in with the prevailing
color scheme, however, and just look ugly (the light green a bit more so
than the brown). No mold changes have been made for this toy, so this repaint
obtains all the features and flaws that it predecessor did in this area.

     Although it's still
a rather nice paint scheme, I recommend the original Rattrap Transmetal
over its repaint. However, since mint Rattrap TMs are harder to find nowadays,
you may find this repaint to be the cheaper alternative.

       Following the quantum surge, Rattrap
gained the advantage of a meched-out armor shell and a swift dragster vehicle
mode. A top-notch soldier, his fellow Maximals rely on his reconnaissance
reports to locate enemy outposts. The new hot rod mode has increased his
speed and agility on the battlefield, and a powerful, battle-whip blade
that we wields while in robot mode has made him a powerful adversary to
all Predacons.
