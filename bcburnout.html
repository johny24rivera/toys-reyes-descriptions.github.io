    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Skids. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Skids

     Burn Out is based off
one of the many color variations of the
     <a href="g1skids.html">
      G1 Skids
     </a>
     mold that was used in Diaclone, one of the major predecessor lines to Transformers.
Given that Diaclone robots weren't sentient but had pilots, Burn Out is
paired with Dia who comes with
     <a href="bcsgthound.html">
      Sgt. Hound
     </a>
     ,
which makes Burn Out... female, I guess? As female as a piloted mech can
be, I guess. Except for the face, it generally works-- the face is still
too "Skids-y" for me. Regardless, the major color for Burn Out is definitely
black, with a fair amount of red and light milky gray, along with several
accent colors-- let's just say Burn Out is hardly a toy wanting for paint
apps, as there's no large section on the toy that's too one-tone. The red
is used on some small robot parts such as the toes and middle of the arms,
as well as some other minor parts, and painted stripes on the sides of
the car mode, along with red headlights and taillights. Although they're
very much in the same style as the red stripes on Generations Skids-- which
is certainly intentional, as the Diaclone toys of the mold (mostly) had
the same stripes as G1 Skids-- the white outlines and bronze "tapering
off" paint apps on the sides look quite nice and help make it pop more.
That said, I wish the bronze was a bit more metallic, as it doesn't contrast
with the red quite as much as I'd like. The light milky gray is mostly
used on her weapons and upper robot legs-- it's a rather blah color, but
at least it's spiced up a bit with a good amount of glitter in the plastic
mix to make it... well, tolerable. Better-looking is the amount of silver
paint on Burn Out-- from the wheel hubs to the windshield wiper details
to the face and headcrest details to the shoulder guns, it all looks good
and contrasts with the black quite nicely. The transparent plastic is an
odd color that seems to tread the line between pale purple and pale blue--
regardless, it's too pale to really add much to the color scheme in either
mode. As for "lesser" colors, I LOVE the metallic gold on the slide-out
shoulder launchers, as it gives a little additional color "surprise!" to
the feature. The yellow used for the eyes is okay, but isn't used elsewhere,
when a couple of other yellow accents would've looked nice. There's also
some easily-missible dark blue paint apps on the inside of the door-wings.

     Burn Out is pretty well-done
for what she is, with a good number of paint apps that also contrast well
with all her black. That said, because it's homaging a toy that was basically
Skids in black, this toy looks just too much like Skids in black in both
modes. If you're a Diaclone fan this is most certainly worth a pick-up,
but as far as something really unique and different there's certainly many
other BotCon exclusives that fit that bill more.

       Her whole life, Dia has known nothing
but the Diaclone project. Born in 1982, the same year that the program
began and the reason her parents named her as they did, every moment of
Dia's upbringing was dedicated to one day enlisting and training to become
a mech pilot. Her ambitions eventually became reality and she was partnered
with the Burn Out mech.

       Although trending towards the smaller
side of the mech spectrum, Burn Out has an impressive array of weaponry
in humanoid mode. When in full battle status, Burn Out bristles with armaments
from pulse rifles to destructive concussion levelers. As with the other
Diaclone mechs, targeting of these weapons while maintaining balance and
maneuverability is coordinated through aid of an artificial intelligence
equipped in the mech's central computer. The AI from Burn Out is a copy
of Dia's own personality and every bit as determined and stoic as its pilot.
It is also just as stubborn, often leading Dia to disable the voice command
function lest she start arguing with something that is essentially herself.
A woman of very few words, she finds the verbal exertion more exhausting
than the strenuous physical activity needed to pilot the suit without computer
assistance.
