    Megatron's futuristic
aircraft mode is done... okay... for a Knight Armor Turbo Changer, though
there are some obvious proportional issues when compared to the movie model--
most obviously, that the wings are too small and the cockpit section is
definitely too big. From a side view, you can definitely tell he's too
thick vertically. Heck, you can make up the basic position of his robot
mode given the details of it that "leak" out onto the sides-- the feet
near the front of the cockpit, the chest details on the bottom sides, and
the arms near the back. The arms form the only really obvious outright
piece of "kibble" in this mode, though, basically just forming the back
end of the jet mode but without really looking like anything else in this
mode. There's some panels above said hands, but they're not particuarly
convincing. However, the "main body" of the jet and the thrusters in the
middle look pretty proportional. The mold detailing is a little sparse
for a movie toy, but there's still several panels on the wings and body,
along with some pistons, pipes, and the like across his main body, particularly
near the middle. Nothing particularly intricate, though. The paint detailing
is so-so in this mode-- there's some light muddy brown paint on his cockpit
window, some engine-like details near the center of the body, and on the
front of part of his wings, but there definitely could've been more to
make his color scheme more visually interesting.

    Transforming Megs to
his robot mode is a cinch-- just make sure the small tabs on his nosecone
and back end are undone, then slide down the entire middle thruster assembly,
which should cause everything else to spring into place for robot mode
except for the feet, which you'll have to fold forward. (Sometimes the
wings aren't cooperative either, but again, that's solved with a simple
fold.) This is definitely where the emphasis for this toy design went,
as proportionally he's quite accurate to the movie, here. He does have
a bit of a backpack-- the main body of the jet forms his back here-- and
his folded-in wings and a bit of the center of his nosecone stick out behind
his arms and between his legs, respectively. As opposed to the vehicle
mode, the mold detailing here is quite intricate, with lots of curvy layered
metal armor over his legs, the "skirt" on his waist, the slightly asymmetrical
detailing on his chest and shoulders, and the gauntlets on his forearms,
with his small cannon on the side of his right lower arm. His headsculpt
is also very detailed and spot-on, with a rounded forehead, a large pointy
chin and nose, and scowling eyes and sharp teeth. The paint detailing is
also quite well-done in this mode too, with some dark brownish gray paint
highlighting a LOT of his armor details on his main body, head and arms,
and quite a lot of light muddy brown paint on his arms, stomach, and legs
to boot. His eyes are also an eeevil red. By opening up the panel on his
upper back, his Knight Armor helmet will flip onto his head, and this is
one MEAN-lookin' helmet. It honestly looks more Viking-esque than knight-like,
with very large curved horns on the side, lots of angular details on the
forehead, a long skinny visor near the center, and what look like a large
maw at the bottom for his angular teeth. The whole helmet is painted light
muddy brown, with some dark royal purple closer to the center. It's a really
neat shade of purple, I wish it was used more on the toy. For articulation
in this mode, Megatron can move forward at the elbows and slightly down
at the ankles, but that's it. (Trying to rotate his shoulders outwards
will kickstart his transformation, so don't do that.)

Megatron has a really nice robot mode (minus some kibble), with great proportions
and some exceptional paint and mold detailing. However, it's almost like
his jet mode is a different toy, given its considerably wonkier proportions
and general lack of paint and mold detailing. Definitely a mixed bag, and
about middle-of-the-pack as far as Knight Armor Turbo Changers go.
