    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Fusion Blast Megatron.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Fusion Blast Megatron

     Megatron certainly lives
up to his name, now with an almost entirely all-black color scheme. Luckily,
it's not quite THAT boring-- Megatron's main colors are actually two shades
of black, a bluish shade and than a more "faded black" shade. They don't
exactly contrast, but it's more interesting than a straight black scheme.
The light gray and silver provide excellent contrast to the black, though
he admittedly is still pretty monochromatic. He does have a few metallic
silvery blue paint apps, though, both to give him at least a little color
and to hearken to his "icy" nature from the movie. His paint apps on his
face are very... odd, though-- it looks like he has black lipstick and
mascara on, the way they're arranged.

     Night Attack Megatron
is still one of the weakest Fast Action Battler molds, but at least this
time he has a good color scheme that isn't so dull. I think another color
besides black could've been used as a main color, just to break up things
a bit more, but black/silver/gray looks better than just the gray of the
original version of this mold.

       According to Megatron, the best time
to attack is when your enemy can't see you. With his new stealth mode,
he fades into the darkness like a ghost, and not even the most advanced
Autobot sensors can spot him. He hovers silently in the night sky, waiting
for Optimus Prime to pass in range, when he'll dive into action with his
cannons blazing.
