    Sideswipe's vehicle mode
is a Dodge Viper convertible. As you'd expect from an Alternator, his vehicle
mode is flawless, and very well-detailed. The various headlights and rear
lights are all very realistic-looking, and use clear plastic, of course.
The tires are chrome on the inside, with quality rubber on the outside.
The rear-view mirrors are adjustable. You can open up the hood. And the
seats are very well-detailed, as is the dashboard- there's even a miniature
gear shift between both of the seats! The only problem I have with this
mode- and it's a very minor one- is the Autobot symbol behind the seats.
I mean, the entire idea of Alternators is that you could easily mistake
their vehicle modes for "actual" model cars- the Autobot symbol sort of
ruins that and points out too obviously that Sideswipe's a Transformer.

    Like many of the other
Alternators, Sideswipe has a rather difficult transformation, especially
when it comes to his arms. However, UNLIKE many of the other Alternators,
his robot mode isn't too much to look at. It's rather awkward in its look,
especially around the legs, where, because of the odd movement points,
he's always stuck with his legs spread out. He's also got a ton of vehicle
mode extras hanging off him, and most of them don't integrate into his
robot mode at all. For example, the shell of the back half of the vehicle
just hangs off his back; his car doors look very unsightly hanging behind
his arms; and his car hood just sticks out from under his butt. The car
grills behind his feet look weird, too. Not only that, but all these extras
get in the way of movement to some extent, making them very frustrating
indeed. And, although his movement in the head and arms is pretty good,
the articulation below that is very hindered. The waist can't rotate bcause
of all the pieces behind it; the legs can't move backwards at all at the
hips (only from side to side); and they can barely move back-and-forth
at the knees. Yet another downside to this toy is that, unlike practically
all of the other Alternators, it really doesn't resemble its G1 counterpart
much at all. Alternator Sidewsipe's got
    <a href="g1sideswipe.html">

    face, and his color scheme, but that's really about it. His robot mode
look is entirely different, his vehicle mode is different, and it just
doesn't make him as immediately recognizable as most of the other Alternators.
Sideswipe does have some positive aspects in his robot mode, though. For
one, his proportions (if you ignore all the vehicle extras) are pretty
good, and I do like how the entire middle part of the vehicle mode collapses
into such a small space on his lower chest. His engine-gun also looks really
cool. But alas, it isn't enough to give this mode anything more than an
"ehh...".

    Like all Alternators,
Sideswipe's vehicle mode is very, very nice, but his robot mode suffers
entirely too much from it. There's extras everywhere, and he has some odd
articulation at points. Although he's still not a bad toy, he's my least
recommended of all the Alternators (or at least of those I've seen as of
this writing, 7/04).
