    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Shuffler.

     The Ramhorn set is a
remold of Shuffler, so accordingly the Ramhorn Titan Master is a remold
of the Shuffler Titan Master. In robot mode, there's actually a change
to the
     <i>
      Titan Master's
     </i>
     head. Since G1 Ramhorn has always been a rhino,
here his head's been remolded to look like a rhino head squashed and stretched
into human proportions. It's actually a pretty cool look-- he has little
bits above his head that look like ears, a tiny silver horn for a nose,
little light blue eyes on the sides of the head, and a silver faceplate-like
detail on his lower chin. It's a nice "roboticized" rhino head and honestly
kinda reminds me of one of those old Battle Beasts, being a humanoid with
a beast head. The rest of the Titan Master has the same mold details as
Shuffler, and sadly beyond the head the rest of the mode is entirely a
milky dull rusty orange, with no other paint apps or color variations whatsoever.
The rusty orange is a pretty decent shade, but having the entire robot
mode in it is rather boring. In head mode, the face has also been remolded,
apparently to resemble a cancelled rhino-to-head Japanese Headmaster. It's
a pretty solid headsculpt, with side antennae that also look little ears
the way they droop forward a bit at the top. His center headcrest is fairly
large, hinting back at the whole "horn" thing, and he's also got some minor
mechanical details and other lines on the "helmet" to mix things up a bit
more. The face itself is pretty humanoid, with blue eyes but otherwise
painted silver with a normal nose and mouth. The lines below the eyes look
pretty cool and add a bit more unique of a detail to the face. Because
the whole head itself is dull rusty orange beyond the face, there isn't
any odd color "mismatch" along different sections of the head as there
can be with other Titan Masters in head mode.

     Two mold changes have
been made to the accessory for this set, both done primarily for the beast
mode. First off, the beast head has been completely changed, to fit G1
Ramhorn's head-- the details are quite well-done, with all the robotic
details taken pretty much straight from the G1 toy but more 3-D, with two
vented ears and many hard edges to his no-nonsense face. In tank mode,
the rhino head folds out into three separate sections, but... it doesn't
really look like anything? No visible cannons or guns or anything, just...
well, a rhino head segmented out into three sections. The horns point forward,
but given that the front of the tank pokes out further than said horns,
it's hard to see them doing much damage to any potential Decepticon. Also,
the shoulder pads on the toy have been changed to match a close approximation
of Ramhorn's shoulder missile launchers (again, from the G1 toy). They're
smaller and longer proportionally than the source material they're trying
to ape, but still look prettty appropriate, with three little "bumps" near
the front that look like missiles popping just a bit out of a missile launcher,
with several square and angular details near the back end of the toy.

     The color scheme on
the Ramhorn accessory is prety simple-- just like the Titan Master, he's
almost entirely a milky dull rusty orange. The only exceptions to this
are some metallic gold paint on his remolded shoulder "missile launchers",
and some on the eyes too. I mean... really, that's
     <i>
      it
     </i>
     ? No painted
treads, or perhaps the missile pod details from the weapon mode? These
two colors both complement and contrast each other nicely, but man, Ramhorn
desperately needs some more paint apps here. This color scheme is far too
bland.

     Titans Return Ramhorn
is an interesting twist on the old G1 cassette character, giving the Titan
Master a rhino head and a new character face, while the accessory gets
some remolding to make him look like his G1 toy in beast mode, but then
giving him weapon and tank modes as well. Unfortunately, the toy being
almost entirely one color-- even if it's a decent color-- was a bad decision,
given how little paint is on the toy (especially the accessory). The new
rhino head looks good in beast mode, but it doesn't make for a convincing
top to the tank mode. Overall still a pretty good Titan Master set, but
not as good as Shuffler.
