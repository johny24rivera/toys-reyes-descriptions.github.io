    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     What's this? A Bumblebee
mold without a reverse-colors redeco?! Well, we can't have that! For this
version of "Night Ops" Bumblebee, again the colors have been reversed,
but the paint apps have been switched around too. In vehicle mode the yellow
is mostly limited to a long stripe down the sides which enlarges to the
back side points, which are still made of yellow plastic. (It should be
mentioned here that the yellow plastic is a just a bit more "orangey" than
the strictly yellow paint, so the stripe is a bit "mismatched" as it goes
back. It's a bit unfortunate, the disconnect, though the yellow isn't quite
as "orangey" as on many Movie 'Bee toys.) Beyond the stripe, there's also
the three diagonal bits on each side of the front hood painted yellow (no
stripes this time). The windows are painted silver (EXCEPT for the rear
window, sadly), and the front headlights are a really nice moderately light
blue that pops VERY well against the black. I really wish this color was
used more. In robot mode a bit more of the yellow plastic pokes through
on the head and upper arms, but the yellow and black placement is a bit
more... "haphazard" in this mode, more like a side-effect of how it's spread
out in vehicle mode than with any real thought of how it would look in
this mode. There's only a little bit of paint on the robot mode, for one--
black on the front of the lower arms, silver and blue on the face, and
a bit of yellow on the upper legs. All of the other paint in this mode
is from the vehicle mode. This leads to too much black on the bottom half,
a bit too much yellow on the top half, and broken, fragmented yellow stripes
on the sides because of the transformation. Because of this, the placement
of the aforementioned paint apps in this mode is mind-boggling-- paint
the lower arms black, but not the faux tires on the shoulders? No yellow
paint on all those details on the lower legs, but highlight those drastically
under-sized upper legs with that paint? So many weird choices...

     No mold changes have

     I do like the 1-step
version of Night Ops Bumblebee over the original 1-step version of this
mold, as for me the "reverse" color scheme on 'Bee looks better pretty
much without exception. However, though the vehicle mode largely looks
pretty nice, the breakup of the colors in robot mode is kinda weird-- and
there's the whole "awful mold" thing, too. If you want a RID2015 Night
Ops 'Bee, I'd get... pretty much any other version of him in that color
scheme.
