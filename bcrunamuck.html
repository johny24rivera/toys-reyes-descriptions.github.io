    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Turbo
Tracks. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     Runamuck here takes the
same general colors from his G1 toy and enhances them, complicating the
color scheme a bit more and making this a definite "mold upgrade" for a
character who hasn't gotten one since his original toy. The pearly white
plastic looks a bit better overall than a "straight white" would, and contrasts
excellently with the orange used for much of his robot mode parts. The
white paint used on some of his clear plastic pieces (like the roof) is
defintely a more straightforward white, though, and visually clashes slightly
with the plastic-- that said, this isn't a huge deal, just a tad noticeable.
Said clear plastic is tinted pretty considerably on Runamuck, so you can't
really see his robot parts inside easily, which is definitely a plus. The
rear windows have also been painted a dull dark gray that's so close in
hue to the tinted plastic it actually blends in quite well, unlike most
clear plastic/painted window combos on a lot of other Transformers' car
modes. The light metallic bronzish gold is what really makes the color
scheme, in my opinion, with the spoiler, the front grill, the "wings" in
robot mode, and a really nice stripe down the sides of the vehicle mode
all decked out in this very attractive color. It contrasts exceedingly
well with Runamuck's otherwise glossy color scheme, to boot. There's also
a few other odds and ends painted on Runamuck, such as his headlights,
taillights, and face (well, what little he has of one) that helps to keep
most white areas from looking boring. That said, the hood or roof could've
used another paint app or two beyond two Decepticon insignias (one painted
on, the other a rub symbol) to help it stand out a tad more.

     Runamuck has all the
mold changes to the mold that
     <a href="genwheeljack.html">
      Generations Wheeljack
     </a>
     has, as well as a new headsculpt that mirrors a more detailed version of
his G1 head quite well. From a side view, the head is a tad skinny (probably
for clearance issues in vehicle mode), but that's a small quibble.

     TFCC Runamuck is a great
repaint of a great mold that homages the original extremely well. He has
a lot of paint apps to help his make him very eye-catching-- particularly
all that bronzish gold paint. Definitely recommended if you're in the market
for high-end exclusives, though I must confess I like his partner
     <a href="bcoverrun.html">
      Over-Run

     a tad more.

       As part of a warped game, Runamuck cruises
highways at top speed and rejoices in the chaos he creates. The other vehicles
and Cybertronians on the road are merely obstacles between which Runamuck
darts, hoping to see them slam on the brakes and twirl out of control.
His maniacal laughter can be heard as he races away from the smoking wrecks.
Some might believe he plays these games to spread fear. In reality it's
just so that he can watch the resulting collisions and explosions as they
fill the streets with such beautiful disaster. It fascinates him. However
such appreciation is short-lived as his partner, Over-Run, sets it upon
himself to enhance its beauty. Which usually means even more awesome explosions
and mayhem!
