    Mold History
   </b>
   : Mirage GT's mold was
originally used for the Beast Machines toy Mirage, which came out back
in 2000.

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Mirage.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Mirage

     Mirage GT's vehicle mode

     -
rather uncreative name reuse, I know), while pretty cool mold-wise, has
an absolutely HORRID color scheme. The bright yellow is way too...bright,
and the neon red definitely doesn't help matters much. The black helps
the contrast a little, but it still doesn't do much, since almost the whole
thing's bright yellow in this mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Mirage GT's robot mode
is a little better, since there's more black and less yellow. The color
scheme still stays mostly the same, however, and because of this, the toy
still looks rather bad, and is still too bright. An interesting thing one
might notice during Mirage GT's transformation is that his Vehicon spark
crystal has been replaced by a solid red orb. I would have preferred an
Autobot spark crystal, as that would have been pretty cool, but Hasbro
admitted that these repaints were a bit rushed in their development. At
least he's still got an Autobot symbol on his hood in vehicle mode.

     No mold changes have
been made to Mirage GT since his predecessor, so Mirage GT retains all
the positives and negatives in that area.

     Mirage was one of the
best molds of Beast Machines, if not THE best, so it's nice to see his
mold get used again. The color scheme used for this repaint was rather
horrid, but if you can see past that, it's still a rather good toy. The
Beast Machines version is better, though.
