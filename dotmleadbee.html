    Another new Transformers
line needs another big Bumblebee toy, of course! As it's always been in
the movie-verse, Bumblebee's alt mode is a Chevrolet Camaro, with the proper
minor modifications made (modified bumpers, spoiler) to make him accurate
to his DotM "racing" version. I can't really say anything much about the
core vehicle mode that hasn't been said about pretty much every other mainline
movie Bumblebee toy up to this point; you either like the orange-yellow-and-black
color scheme on the Camaro, or you don't. The main paint details like the
stripes and headlights/taillights are all here, with the exception of the
hubcaps-- for a toy this big, there's really no excuse to miss a big detail
like that (it also makes Bumblebee look really boring from a side-view).
The proportions are spot-on, and the only robot mode extras are the tips
of the heels poking out the back end. Also, the windows are shaded just
a tad too light-- you can make out Bumblebee's robot parts inside the windows
just a tad too easily for my liking. By itself, the vehicle mode is disappointingly
small for a Leader class toy-- it's just barely larger than the
    <a href="rotfhabumblebee.html">
     Human
Alliance
    </a>
    version scale-wise. What pushes Bumblebee into the Leader-class
pricepoint here is his HUGE Mechtech backpack-- it makes up nearly half
the toy's mass, and it's weighty too, folks. In "deactivated" mode, it
functions as a bit of a booster pack for 'Bee, with two boosters on the
sides, plenty of engine-like details around the battery components, and
a slightly collapsed large gun on the front end. If you push the red-and-bronze
tab forward on the Mechtech pack, a "transformation" sound effect will
emit, lights will blink, and the gun will move forward more while the two
boosters rotate around to become two (non-firing) missile packs. Now the
electronics really activate in this mode-- if you push in on the gun, the
transparent bits will flash green and it'll make some charging up/blasting
noises. Press in on the sides of either of the missile pods and it'll flash
orange while some firing sounds are emitted. The missile pods can move
up and down a little, but unfortunately due to the sliding/activating gimmick,
they can't exactly fire in any direction. However, this Mechtech pack's
real strength is in just how many other weapons you can attach to it--
it has four areas where you can clip on C-clip weapons from other Transformers
(one on each missle pod and two near the back end), and a whopping five
ports for other Mechtech weapons, so you can really give Bumblebee some
INSANE firepower here if you want to.

    Another unique aspect
to this big Bumblebee is the "stealth force" in-between mode that he has,
which is sort of a weaponized "peek-aboo!" version of his car mode that's
a bit more fragmented with weapons bristling. The back half of the vehicle
mode stays the same (as this mode definitely looks best with the Mechtech
backpack on), but the sides of the car split apart, with thirds of the
hood sweeping forward, the car doors moving upwards, and the robot arms
moving out a little. The robot arm that's a gun looks right at home here,
but the one that's a hand looks a bit out of place. My main complaint about
this mode is how arbitrary it seems; nothing really locks into place, and
it's so much of a "halfway transformation" you could do this with many
other Transformers that don't explicitly have this gimmick. It is a bit
of a neat
    <i>

    For a Leader class toy,
Bumblebee's robot mode isn't all that accurate, mostly suffering from his
"Stealth Force" gimmick and Mechtech weapons backpack, it would appear.
He's a bit leggy for Bumblebee-- like "Movie Prime" leggy-- and he's got
a bit of a hunchback, mostly made from his front bumper and hood but accentuated
by the fact that his car doors behind his back actually have to rotate
up AND to the side-- they can't just rotate straight out to the side like
on most of the other mainline Bumblebee toys. His car parts backpack is
substantial, consisting of almost his entire hood, as that's needed to
keep his Mechtech backpack on. Even with Bumblebee's rather wide feet and
far-back heels, though, the sheer weight of the Mechtech backpack can cause
him to fall backwards quite easily in this mode. (The clips that attach
his backpack to his actual back are very strong, however, and don't detach
under the backpack's weight.) His arms are also a bit short, though this
may simply be exaggerated by how long his legs are. He also has the same
problem with those bits of the car mode on his hips getting in the way
of leg articulation that many other mainlne Bumblebee toys do. That all
said, the mold detailing on Bumblebee here is amazing-- pistons, tubes,
and the like are all where they should be, and I do like the way a large
piece of his chest clips into place in the center, making it look like
his car front halves merge into a bunch of mechanical bits in the center.
His headsculpt is also incredibly spot-on-- and yes, his visor can flip
down over his head here. I do wish there was a bit more paint detailing
to help show off all those mold details, particularly on the stomach and
arms, but it's still "good enough". As far as articulation, Bumblebee can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at three points),
at the base of the thumb and at the base of the palm on his one (left)
hand (with the fingers all as one piece); and at the hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and a whopping six points at the ankles. Still,
that all sounds like more than it actually functionally is, given that
Bumblebee's big backpack and the bits of kibble on his legs can get in
the way of stability and/or articulation. (With his backpack off, though,
he can assume a fairly good number of poses.)

    Leader class Bumblebee
is a decent choice if you're really fond of the "Stealth Force" modes seen
in the movie and want a toy that can transform into both a "regular" vehicle
mode, stealth force mode, and robot mode (as this is the ONLY DotM toy
that can do so), or if you want a vehicle mode you can pump out with a
ridiculous number of weapons, but if that's not a big deal to you, this
is not a recommended buy, particularly for full price. The robot mode has
myriad problems due to the gimmicks, and the car mode's too small for when
you get rid of the huge cumbersome backpack.

      Bumblebee was the first to try out the
Mechtech weapons system. With his speed and firepower both boosted to incredible
levels, he began racking up Decepticon takedowns faster than Ironhide could
even keep track.
