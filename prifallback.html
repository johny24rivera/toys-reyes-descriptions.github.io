    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Prime legion Breakdown
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Prime legion

     Like other toys that
have used the "Fallback" name, this Prime-universe version of Fallback
is an homage to G1 Outback, who was also an offroad vehicle of very similar
colors. Fallback's main color is tan, which-- combined with the rust brown
paint used for his robot chest and shoulders-- really helps to give him
that "desert"-- or, I suppose, "outback"-- feel to him. (Of a side note--
due to his chestpiece being coated in this "rusty" paint, a bit of it can
be seen peeking out from the top of Fallback's vehicle mode-- this is a
minor quibble, though.) There's a bit of gray plastic in here too, used
on such places like his upper legs and wheels. Since the other colors complement
each other well enough, this gray serves as a decent "neutral" color to
play against, and is a bit darker than most gray plastics used on TFs,
thus looking a bit better to my eye than boring light milky gray plastic.
Most of Fallback's paint is of the aforementioned "rusty brown" type, though
he's got a couple of other accent colors, like black windows (which, needless
to say, contrast very well with the light tan), and silver paint on his
face and front bumper with some nice sky-blue detailing on the eyes. Oddly,
despite these parts being silver, Fallback's spare wheel in vehicle mode
is painted a metallic gunmetal gray-- a color of paint used nowhere else
on the toy. I think gunmetal almost always looks better than silver (it's
a bit more metallic-looking), and applaud its use there, but it's kind
of odd two colors that are so similar were used as accent colors when just
one or the other would have done the trick. Fallback's Cyberverse weapon
is the same long-barreled gun that Breakdown has, but his version is a
light pale green, a more "friendly" color than Breakdown's purple gun.
I wish it fit in with Fallback's general color scheme a bit better, but
at least it makes his weapon a bit different than the usual "Autobot red"
2012 Cyberverse weapons.

     No mold changes have
been made to Prime Fallback.

     Prime Fallback is a
pretty decent re-use of the Breakdown mold, homaging a G1 character quite
well both in terms of its color scheme and in terms of the alt mode. If
you're wanting to pick up the Breakdown mold, but think that this is too
small of a toy for him, this appropriatedly-sized re-use of it as a former
G1 mini-bot works better. In terms of color scheme, I'd recommend Fallback
slightly over Breakdown anyways.

       Before the war, Fallback scouted newly
discovered worlds to determine if they were suitable for colonization.
Now his duty is to assess a world's environmental health and recommend
ways in which the Autobots can protect it while also using natural resources
to their advantage.
