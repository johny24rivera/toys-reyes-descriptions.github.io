    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Rook. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Combiner Wars Rook

     Autobot Hound's color
scheme somewhat fits his normal G1 color scheme pretty closely, with most
of his color scheme being dark green-- a bit darker green than usual, in
fact, though it's a forest green compared to the usual military green on
the character. There's also a good amount of black on him as well, from
the wheels to his hand-foot-gun to his waist. His black paint is a nice
metallic shade of the color, though, and is used on most of his vehicle
"bar" details, as well as the faux bumper details on his chest and some
piping details on his legs. By themselves this would be a bit of a overly
dark color scheme, but there are some light colors to help contrast against
all this, although not as much as is usual on Hound toys. He's got some
light milky gray plastic on his upper legs and around his elbows-- it is
a very blah boring shade of the color, but it does provide some much-needed
contrast and isn't used much, so I don't mind it as much as I normally
would have. He's also got some silver paint on the abs and waist, as well
as on the faux chest headlights, gun, and face. He's also got the usual
star symbol on the front of his jeep mode, some nice sky blue paint on
his eyes, and a really nice shade of metallic golden yellow on the faux
headlights on his waist. They're all nice additions, but they're mostly
used on the robot head and chest-- the robot arms and legs, and especially
the vehicle mode, are too dark, being almost entirely black and dark green.
On the plus side, because so many of the details are dark in vehicle mode,
the robot bits on top of that mode aren't as obvious as on
     <a href="cwswindle.html">
      Swindle
     </a>
     .
(I still wish he had significantly more paint in vehicle mode, though,
like on the molded-in pouches on the side-- this mold just has a TON of
details begging for some paint.)

     Hound has the same mold
changes made to the Rook mold as CW Swindle, as well as a unique new headsculpt.
It's pretty much your standard Hound head, with the details nice and crisp
and the proportions spot-on. No complaints here.

I wish had a few more paint apps to help diversify his color scheme more
like, say,
     <a href="uni2hound.html">
      Universe 2.0 deluxe Hound
     </a>
     , but
he's still a solid redeco of Swindle with a great new headsculpt and color
scheme that fits the mold a little better than Swindle's. (Additionally
the mold's proportions fit Hound better than Swindle, if you ask me.) An
easy recommendation.

       Autobot Hound has everything it takes
to make him a good scout: skill, experience, and holographic mapping equipment.
However, his passion for exploring uncharted territory makes him more than
"good"-- it makes him irreplaceable.

        Autobot Hound was part of the initial
Autobot crew aboard the Ark when it crash-landed on Earth. In an odd way,
it was the best thing that ever happened to him. He was tasked by Optimus
Prime to scout the new world, and he was immediately transfixed by the
raw natural beauty of Earth. Hound relishes his job as lead Autobot scout,
as it affords him the chance to search and experience more and more of
his adopted homeworld. Brave, earnest, and thoughtful-- Hound is truly
part of the heart and soul of the Autobots. His hologram blaster projects
accurate battlefield schematics, as well as powerful illusions to trick
enemies into retreat.

         Autobot Hound has proudly served in
the Autobot forces since before the ascent of Optimus Prime. For a bot
that's survived every second of the Great War, Hound isn't particularly
fond of combat. Still, he's willing to do whatever he can to stop the Decepticon
threat. Forms either an arm or leg of Sky Reign, the new combined form
of Sky Lynx.
