    Venom's vehicle mode
is a muscle car-- not quite the first vehicle I would have picked, but
it's certainly an eeeevil muscle car, that's for sure. Black with purple
flames is agreat paint job, and Venom's signature spider symbol is smack-dab
in the center of the hood. Oh, and let's not forget the spike bumpers and
wheel rims that look like throwing stars, hmm? And his license plate says
"VENOM", in case his disguise wasn't obvious enough. Besides the aforementioned
spikes, though, the mold detailing in this mode is a bit sparse, though
part of that may just be because Venom is HUGE for a $15 toy. He'd easily
pass for a Voyager-class transformer, no question. Venom also has no robot
mode extras whatsoever in this mode-- heck, even from the UNDERSIDE he
practically has none, with his robot hands just BARELY being visible in
you look closely in one corner of the vehicle mode. Now THAT'S impressive.
Venom does have some a bit of a frustrating transformation, however-- whether
you're getting him into robot mode OR vehicle mode, there's a lot of little
fiddly bits and panels that have to be just right in order for everything
to click into place.

    Venom's robot mode is
okay, but it has some definite proportions issues. The lower legs are HUGE
compared to the upper legs, the arms are rather skinny and flat, and his
chest doesn't connect to his waist like you'd think-- rather, it connects
at quite an angle to the waist, making it look like Venom is jutting out
his pelvis. There's also some kibble problems, like the huge chunks of
car parts hanging off his lower legs and his back. His wheels also look
odd, the way they're positioned vertically on his shoulders like that.
The car door pieces around his arms can also activate his spring-loaded
missile launchers housed in his lower arms rather easily. That's not to
say that Venom is completely terrible in robot mode, of course-- he's definitely
got some upsides, as well. For one thing, I love his chest and head design.
The way his spider insignia breaks up the sides of his "toothed" front
bumper looks really cool, and Venom's head sculpt is top-notch, completely
with creepy tongue-thing and all, while still having some robotic purple
parts on the head to make it look more mechanical. In fact, with all the
sinewy purple parts visible, it actually makes Venom look rather technorganic
as a whole, as opposed to just mechanical. I mean, the mold detaling is
just excellent, and the paint detailing is in an adequate enough among
and spread out enough over the figure to break up all the black. Venom
also has pretty good articulation-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two points), at the wrists, at the base of
each index finger and again at the base of the other three fingers on each
hand (with all three other fingers being one piece of plastic), and he
can move at the hips (at two places), ankles, and knees (at two places).
He is a tad back-heavy, though, which slightly limits the amount of posing
he can do.

    Venom's car mode is
fantastic in every way, but his transformation can be a little frustrating,
and his robot mode suffers from some major proportion and kibble problems.
Not a BAD toy by any means, but my least favorite of the first wave of
the Marvel Transformers Crossovers.

      Obsessed with the destruction of Spider-Man,
Venom welcomes any advantage. This powerful war suit allows him to cruise
the city streets in secrecy, searching for his quarry. ItÂ’s got the speed
to pursue any target, or outrun any hero that might give chase. When it
comes time to fight, his mech mode spews out volleys of powerful missiles
capable of blasting other war suits to pieces.
