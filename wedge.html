    Vehicle mode is a bulldozer.
This mode is VERY nice, and practically flawless. There are no extras whatsoever
in this mode, although
    <a href="landfill.html">
     Landfill's
    </a>
    head can
be seen a bit through the transparent plastic used for the driver's seat.
This mode has nice detailing practically everywhere, with some real nice
pipes and such on the side of the bulldozer. There isn't much mold detailing
on the topside of the bulldozer, but the gray paint detailing and the large
Autobot symbol make up for this. He doesn't have actual rubber treads,
but given his transformation, this would be impossible. Instead, he has
two small plastic wheels on the underside of his treads to roll along on.
He rolls along better on this than he would on actual rubber treads, so
it's no big deal. My main complaint about this toy isn't really so much
about the TOY as it is the PRICE. For a deluxe-priced toy, Wedge is inexcusably
small. In fact, he's closer to the size of RiD basic than he is a deluxe,
and I'm dissapointed that he wasn't priced accordingly. Sure, he's a little
big for a basic, but it's always better to get more for your money than
less.

    Although Wedge's robot
mode isn't quite as flawless as his vehicle mode, it's still pretty good.
This mode is just as well-detailed as the other one. Some may view Wedge's
shovel halves on his shoulders as "extras", but I actually think they complement
the mode a bit rather than detract from it. As with the other Build Team
members, Wedge's robot head is wonderfully detailed, and adds character.
He has a very youthful look to him, although he has a determined look etched
onto his face. He also has minature bulldozer wedges molded on the sides
of his face, which is a nice touch. One of my problems with this mode,
however, is that Wedge's hands are actually just molded onto the underside
of his treads, which doesn't really look that good, to say the least. His
feet are also rather small, and he doesn't have any backing to them, so
he tends to fall over on his back a little easier than I'd like. Wedge's
chest also sticks out a bit too far, but this is a pretty minor quibble.
Wedge's weapon is pretty neat- a double-beam gun, which is rather creative.
No gimmick is included with Wedge, but that's okay, since they seem to
mess up the part of the Transformer they're in half of the time. Wedge's
waist is MADE to turn in this mode, but a peg lodged into his back (used
for Landfill mode) prevents this unless you unhook it, which is rather
odd. Still, a pretty good robot mode, overall.

    Wedge is a pretty good
toy in both modes. If he were just a little bigger or packaged at the basic
price point, then I think he'd be much less of a shelf warmer. Highly recommended.

        Wedge's vehicle mode
is a very bright Bulldozer. It's a very bright color scheme, but it seems
to work with this mode. Granted, I've never seen an orange Bulldozer, but
it is bright and colorfull without being gawdy. In terms of robot kibble,
Beastbot speaks the truth, this thing is pretty much flawless. The bits
of head that are visible through the windows aren't too bad, and not enough
to really concern me. He has a few bits on the bottom as well, but they
aren't really robot bits, just a penel with a peg hole in it, and a connector
for Landfill. Nothing to worry about. It's a cool mode, and holds together
very well. The only thing that is a bit odd is that the shovel has a small
gap where it splits, but it's okay. Paint detailing isn't horrible, a little
more would be nice, but I'm not complaining, it might get a bit crowded
with much more. Now as Beastbot said, he is quite tiny, about 2.5 quarters
as big as a deluxe.

        Wedges robot mode is...pretty
nice. I like it a lot. His head is simple, but it fits in with the other
Landfill component's bits, and is overall very sleek. He is very poseable
in most areas. I like how the treads of the Bulldozer tur into his arms,
it is a nice appearance. The hands don't bother me too much, but real hands
would have been nice. His pistons turn into a double barreled gun, and
for the most part it looks good, but you can also stick it on his back
in the hole as a small backpack if you don't want it in his hands. You
can also flip his arms back to looking like treads and bring down the shovel
blades to have some bashing-esque weapons. So let's get to the cons. Firstly,
he does have a chest that sticks out a bit too far, which contains the
large gesalt head. Next con, is his feet. Do to the way they connect in
vehicle mode...well, to put it simply, I have gotten him to stand about
10 times. They just will not stand. I think that is what is keeping me
from putting him into the 9.0+ rating. That and his small size.

       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        If you put the flaws
into consideration, Wedge is a pretty cool figure, and I would recommend
him to pretty much anyone that collects transformers. The vehicle mode
within itself is enough to make me recommend him. Moderately recommended.

           The other construction Autobots look
to Wedge as their leader, even though hes still young. Hes a natural
leader in the making with his take-charge attitiude and revved-up energy.
He can be reckless and make mistakes but will never jeopardize his friends,
and is always there to help them. He bulldozes into battle with double
beam guns.
