    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Dragstrip.

     There aren't that many
well-known F1 race cars from Transformers, so a redeco of Drag Stip pretty
much inevitably means Mirage. And, Hasbro has reproduced that Mirage "feel"
quite faithfully on this redeco, with an excellent paint scheme consisting
mostly of both blue and white in both modes that contrast against each
other wonderfully, with not too much of any "one color" on any one part
of the toy. The white paint is the exact same shade as the white plastic,
so no issues there. The blue plastic is a little lighter than usual for
Mirage toys, though in my view this is a positive turn, since his blue
is usually duller. He "pops" more this way, and he fits with his "Optimus
Maximus" brethren better who also have generally lighter color schemes.
Beyond simply some white stripes on blue and visa versa, there's also some
nice "62 CIRCUIT RACING" decals on the sides of the race car mode, and
a black "62" on the front nose along with an Autobot symbol. Unfortunately,
because of all the ridges back there and how it breaks up during transformation,
Mirage doesn't have any decals on his spoiler, but it is at least painted
silver-- along with the face, most of the hand/foot/gun weapon, and the
wheel hubs, to help bring out a bit more color variety. What isn't painted
silver on his accessories are the core "hand" part of his hand/foot/gun
weapon and his sword/gun-- it's a somewhat blah shade of light gray, though
it's a few shades darker than usual and only used a little, so it's not
that bad. (That said, as opposed to Drag Strip's sword, Mirage's bio calls
out that weapon as a gun-- which he CAN hold like one, but there's basically
no detailing on the weapon that makes it look like a gun. It's a sword,
held the wrong way.) To top off Mirage's color scheme, there's just a bit
of red-- just on the middle of his shoulders-- that helps add just a little
extra and obviously contrasts well against the blue and white scheme.

     Mirage does have one
mold change, and that's a new headsculpt, which looks very much like an
"updated", more proportional version of his G1 headsculpt. The side vents,
as well as the face, are detailed nicely with silver, though his lips are
accentuated just a bit too much to the point where it looks like he's sad.
Awww, poor Mirage. Otherwise, the headsculpt's quite nice.

     Combiner Wars Mirage
is an excellent purchase, being a superior redeco of what was already one
of the best Combiner Wars deluxes. I'd wholeheartedly recommend him even
if you aren't planning on combining him, particularly if you don't have
a version of the

     mold.

       Put the cloaking power of Mirage in
the hands of a Combiner and look out-- that's 30 tons of steel sneaking
up behind you and walloping you with a punch you can't see coming. The
Decepticons won't know what hit them.

        One of the original Autobots that arrived
on Earth, Mirage has been on the front lines of the Great War for millions
of years. His electro-disruption camouflage ability has enabled him to
survive firefights other bots wouldn't dare to enter. Mirage has always
been loyal to the Autobot cause, but he questions the nature of war itself--
often publicly challenging Autobot authority in wondering if there couldn't
be a better way to settle the never-ending conflict with the Decepticons.
His stealth capability allows him to achieve almost complete invisibility,
but the severe Energon drain gives him a six-minute maximum. Carries an
armor-piercing rocket-dart launcher.

         Mirage has always been an outsider among
the Autobot forces. Before the war, Mirage enjoyed vast riches on Cybertron,
a fact that his teammates seem to hold against him. Given his wealthy background,
ability to cloak his presence, and propensity for questioning the overall
purpose of war, it's no surprise he's considered a bit of a lone wolf.
Forms either an arm or a leg of Optimus Maximus, the combined form of Optimus
Prime.
