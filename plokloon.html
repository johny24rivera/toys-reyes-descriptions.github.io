not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a

     Yet another repaint of
the Episode II Jedi Starfighter has been done up into another Jedi, this
time around Plo Kloon. Plo Kloon certainly has a tasteful color palette,
I'll give him that. The dark blue already goes quite well with the off-white,
and unlike on many SWTFs, it's used rather liberally so that there aren't
any huge patches of that bleh off-white anywhere. What I REALLY like about
the paint apps is how the blue radiates in lines away from the cockpit--
it really makes him stand out from the other Jedi Starfighters. The yellow
also looks pretty good against the blue, but it's too bright to really
do much against the white. The orange used on parts of his robot mode is
also a nice touch, and goes quite well with either color. The black and
silver are used sparingly, and only as accent colors, but they work nicely,
too.

     Plo Kloon has a new
head mold, which like most others is a mechanized version of his "real"
head. Given that Plo Kloon's head is already partially mechanized though,
it's not nearly that much of a stretch this time around to make his features
fit in with a mech-- it's all sculpted quite well.

     Plo Kloon is yet another
repaint of the Episode II Jedi Starfighter mold, but in my opinion he's
the best. The dark blue goes really well with the off-white, and the "sunburst"
pattern in vehicle mode is especially nice. The accent colors, like the
yellow, silver, and black, only help this. Recommended the most out of
the various versions of this mold.

       Plo Koon sweeps into battle over the
planet of Cato Neimodia in his Jedi starfighter. Droid starfighters fly
out of the fog to attack the noble Jedi Master, but they are in for a devastating
surprise. Plo Koon converts his starfighter into a massive mech and blasts
the droid fighters with twin laser cannons!
