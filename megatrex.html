    Beast mode is a tyrannosaurus
rex. This mode is one of the best beast modes IÂ’ve seen, with no extras,
top or bottom. The only slight clue is his back clawd on his legs, which
look like robot parts, and the very slight evidence of his grappling hook
missles on his hips. This mode is very nicely detailed as well, with warts
and signs of wear and tear all over. This mode is fairly well-articulated
as well- the mouth, arms, and legs can all move, although if you move the
legs too much, the hip pieces move with them...

    Robot mode is very nice
and well-crafted, but his tyrannosaurus halves on his back are large and
can get in the way. One of his hands is his tyrannosaurus head, and you
can take its tongue out and fill it up with water, then put the tongue
back in. Then, when you open its mouth, it squirts it, like pretend "poison".
Unlike the TV show one, his other hand can not be disconnected from the
tail claw, but you can move his hand back and forth to make the claw snap.
Two grappling-hook-shaped missles can be fired out of his flesh hip plates.
He has two faces: a mutant bat/lizard face and the face used on the TV
show. One of the major problems with this mode is his chest does not connect
to his back very well, so it may come loose or his head may sink into his
chest from time to time. It is a shame he doesn't have at least one real
hand, though.

    An excellent transformer
in both modes, although robot mode has some extras.

      Millions of years ago, Tyrannosaurus
Rex ruled the earth. Today, Megatron plans to do the same! Duplicating
dinosaur DNA stolen from human research labs, the evil leader has re-engineered
his body structure and equipped it with fearsome high-tech firepower! Poisonous
paralyzer fluids blast from his gaping jaws, while his powerful pincher
claw can cut an enemy in half! Be afraid, earthlings. Be very, very afraid.
