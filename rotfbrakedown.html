    Brakedown is a major
homage to the G1 Stunticon Breakdown, especially when it comes to his vehicle
mode. Like G1 Breakdown, RotF Brakedown has a Lamboughini-esque white sportscar
mode, with just enough changes in this iteration to keep it from being
licensed. Unfortunately, the major change made to Brakedown's alt mode
to get away with that-- shortening the front section-- also makes him look
not quite right. Having the relatively long, steamlined back and middle
sections of the car mode end in such a squished-looking front bumper just
doesn't mesh. However, ignoring that, this mode is pretty good. The black
and red goes fairly well with the white, even if it's not the most exciting
or original color scheme in the world, and all of the necessary details
are painted, such as the headlights and back grill. I do wish a bit more
red was visible in this mode, though, as except for that little bit in
the front and on the taillights this mode looks rather monochrome. There
aren't any robot mode extras visible in this mode at all, and minimal "breaking
up" of the vehicle mode into different pieces with visible separation lines,
so that's all good.

    Brakedown's robot mode,
however, is nowhere near on par with his vehicle mode. First, let's get
the good stuff out of the way-- adding in the dark blue helps out the color
scheme a bit more, making it more varied, and goes well with the other
colors (plus it's appropriate to the homage). There's a TON of great mold
detailing on Brakedown's robot parts, like gears and pistons and all that.
His head is also very well-sculpted, both clearly being influenced by his
G1 head while making it look more like a Movieverse Decepticon, with a
rather sunken, skull-like lower face. The back end of his vehicle mode
makes for a decent chest, and rear wheel bits make for excellent shoulders.
His articulation is also good-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at
three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips (at two points), knees,
and a bit at the ankles as well. However, Brakedown's feet are rather small,
plus the two halves of the front bumper serving as rather curved heroes.
This, combined with his rather large backpack made up of his car hood that
just sticks out unceremoniously behind his back, makes it hard to get him
to stand up. (At least one half of the hood slides over the other, but
still-- that's a pretty large backpack, and set out a lot further from
his actual back than I'd like.) His arms are also rather ridiculously skinny,
and the lower arms have his rather fat car door shells hanging off them,
which is another rather big piece of kibble you have to overlook. On a
lesser note, he could also really use some type of weapon, even if it was
some type of molded in "missile pack" or something.

    Although the G1 homage
is appreciated, RotF Brakedown is altogether the worst scout mold of the
line. His vehicle mode, while generally good, has an oddly squat front
bumper, and his color scheme isn't anything to get excited about either.
His robot mode is what really hurts him though, with tons of vehicle mode
kibble, some odd proportions, and bad stability.

      Decepticon scout Brakedown avoids contact
with the enemy at all costs. His job is to observe and report, not fight.
That's why he's geared for speed, not battle. Unfortunately for him, Mudflap
has other ideas, and now he finds himself racing for his life away from
the determined Autobot warrior.
