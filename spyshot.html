    Spy Shot's alternate
mode is a digital camera. He's one of the most convincing Real Gear toys
in terms of his alt mode-- he's the perfect size for a miniature digital
camera, with the required "cracks" in the camera needed for his transformation
being the only giveaway that he's not a real digicam. Well, and the sticker
on the backside that shows
    <a href="cyransack.html">
     Cybertron Ransack
    </a>
    through the viewfinder, though even that sticker has all the icons you'd
expect on the viewscreen of a digicam, like a "battery charge" icon, how
much the camera is zoomed in, what resolution setting the camera's on,
all that good stuff. (I just wish they hadn't just shrugged their shoulders
at the fact that Spy Shot, a movie toy, is looking at a CYBERTRON character
through his lens.) The lens looks very authentic, as does the rest of the
"buttons", though the "take picture" button on the top is the only button
that actually can be clicked in. The mold detailing is minimal, but that's
to be expected on a miniature camera, which is fairly simplistic in its
aesthetic anyways. The paint detailing is pretty good, though, especially
around the lens-- the silver may not be the best contrast color against
the dull grey, but it is realistic, and at least the dull blue in robot
mode makes a nice, if still dull, secondary color.

    Spy Shot's robot mode
also looks very good, and all the camera parts fit in well with the overall
look, so he's not "kibbly" in any reasonable sense of the word. His proportions
are also really nice, though I think it's rather odd that the waist halves
on his legs aren't supposed to full come together but stay apart with a
fair-sized gap in between them. Spy Shot has the same pincer-claws that
many of the other Real Gear toys do, but unlike most of them, his pincers
can open and close, which is pretty cool for such a small toy. He can also
move at plenty of other places-- namely, the head, the shoulders (at two
points), the elbows (at two points), the hips, and the knees (at three
points). So you can get a ton of cool poses out of this little guy. I do
think his head design is rather dorky-looking, though, with the huge forehead
and the perfectly round optics, though I do have to admit that semi-replicating
the camera flash mechanism on his forehead was a nice little detail.

    Spy Shot is one of the
best Real Gear toys-- he may not have the most eye-catching color scheme,
but he's got an excellent, convincing camera mode and a well-proportioned,
well-articulated, cool-looking robot mode. Highly recommended.

      Spy Shot 6 doesn't talk a lot. Preferring
to remain in camera mode as an observer as an observer in the background.
It's probably from years of spying on the Decepticons. He's got a perfect
memory, able to produce a description of anything he's ever seen or heard.
He prefers not to fight, but when it comes down to it, he can fire focused
beams of laser-intensity light through his lens.
