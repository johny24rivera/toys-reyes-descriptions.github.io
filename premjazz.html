    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie Deluxe
Jazz toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Premium Jazz is what
the toy should've been in the first place. I know, I know, the old "but
they could've have put this many paint apps on a toy until it's been repainted
enough times where they know they'll get their money back" arguement, which
is valid enough. But honestly, having the toy coated in that incredibly
eye-catching shade of metallic silver paint just bumps this toy up a HUGE
notch. The original Jazz had boring, milky gray plastic, and looked dull.
THIS Jazz, for the most part, just has silver in place of the gray, and
looks AMAZING because he not only looks more like he did in the movie,
but it just looks so much more realistic is just so SHINY. Only a few parts
of Jazz-- mainly the parts that are very small or peg into place and thus
undergo some rubbing during transformation-- are left milky gray. Every
other piece of gray plastic on the toy has been coated in this fantastic
silver sheen. It also makes the metallic bronze on Jazz look that much
better. The transparent blue has also been changed to a more vibrant, aquamarine-ish
color, which looks particularly good as Jazz's visor in robot mode. The
light red on the original Jazz has been replaced with a bold cherry red
color, which looks great as a highlight color, particularly on the taillights.
And as if all this weren't enough, some pale metallic gold has also been
added to a few parts on the legs, making him even more ridiculously good-looking.
The fake tires on the sides of his feet are also actually painted this
time as well, instead of just being left black. In addition, his rear car
window, previous made of unpainted solid plastic, is now painted a silvery
blue. (Jazz's black parts and most of his other paint apps have remained
unaltered.)

     Premium Jazz is an incredible
upgrade to the original toy, even moreso considering that the overall color
scheme has not changed, it's just been made metallic. Everything just fits
so PERFECTLY together-- out of all the wide-release Premium toys, I'd recommend
Jazz here the most, even if you have the original. He's just THAT good-looking.

         Premium Jazz is done
in a shiny metallic silver paint, much like ROTF Sideswipe. He looks really
nice in this color, and much more appealing to the eye than the old figure.
Detail painting is also a deeper and more realistic color, and overall,
this figure is far better than the original. My only complaint about the
figure is that he comes with that extendo-jousting stick, which is a silly
weapon if you ask me. My rating of 8 is .6 lower than Beastbot's for personal
reasons, such as the weapon, mold, and I have never really liked silver
color schemes all that much, save for chrome ones.

            Just before coming to Earth, Autobot
Jazz was badly damaged in a battle over a barren world in deep space. He
doesnt remember a lot of the fight, even before Decepticon Brawl offlined
him, but he knows he was hurt really bad. Since that fight, hes worked
with Ironhide to upgrade his endoskeleton reinforcements, and hes kept
his vehicle mode absolutely pristine. Something about getting so badly
damaged made him care even more than he used to about looking good.
