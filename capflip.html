    Captain America's "Flip
and Attack" figure is supposed to be a 4x4 vehicle according to the package,
but like pretty much every other toy in the subline, doesn't look like
much. This "mech mode on its back with the legs flipped up" look is particularly
obvious for ol' Cap-- the only obviously vehicle parts on the toy are the
wheels on the sides (the star-spangled spokes are a nice touch)-- other
than this, there's not even any real indication that this is a vehicle.
I don't see any obvious cockpit, headlights/taillights... nothing. I also
can't see any weapons visible in this mode, which is another strike against
it. On the plus side, the color scheme certainly screams "Captain America"--
he's more blue in this mode than in mech mode, but his patriotic color
scheme of red, white, and blue works quite wonderfully on the toy, each
color contrasting against the other excellently. They're all metallic shades,
as well-- I'm not sure if this is completely true or not, but it LOOKS
like this toy is coated in paint of one color or another from head to toe,
a pretty rare sight indeed among today's toys. There are a few duller,
flatter accent colors like black and gray to keep him from being ENTIRELY
metallic, though.

    To get Cap into his
mech mode, like all of the "Flip and Attack" figures, you wind him back
in his vehicle mode on a flat surface until you hear a clicking sound on
the wheels, then let it go-- the legs will flip forward abruptly a couple
seconds later, the weight and torque of the leg shift
    <i>
     theoretically
    </i>
    making Captain America stand up into his mech mode on his own. It only
seems to happen about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time in my experience, though--
the other times he just unfolds and rockets forward a bit to clatter around
on his front or backside. It's pretty neat to watch when it works properly,
however. As for the mech mode itself, the mold detailing is a bit more
intricate here than in vehicle mode, with places like the waist, mid-chest,
and head having a pretty good number of pistons, wires, and the like molded
into them. (That said, the headsculpt looks a bit off. I understand that
they're going for a "mecha" version of Captain America here, but it's a
bit TOO angular, particularly with the chin-- it makes him look too brutish
and angry.) The crotch also sticks out too much, particularly when looked
at from a side view-- this is slightly necessary due to the gimmick, but
it still sticks out way more than it should and looks odd. I'm also not
fond of just how recessed Cap's hand detailing is-- you can barely tell
it's there, and in spite of all the paint apps Captain America has, the
stars on the inner sides of his wheels are missing paint, which bugs me
a bit more than it should-- I'm not a fan of inconsistency on color schemes.
On the plus side, the number of paint apps is also considerably more varied
in this mode, with white being a bit more obvious-- I particularly love
how the stomach looks like it has red hydraulic pistons amidst all the
white paint. Like other "Flip and Attack" toys, he unfortunately can only
move back-and-forth at the shoulders in this mode-- the legs are locked
in as one piece due to the subline gimmick, but I see no reason why they
couldn't have added elbow and/or head articulation as well.

    By a hair, Captain America
takes the "title" of worst mold from the "Flip and Attack" subline of figures.
The colors look pretty nice, but his vehicle mode is definitely the most
abstract out of all the alt modes in this subline, the headsculpt looks
off, and his crotch sticks forward uncomfortably far in mech mode.
