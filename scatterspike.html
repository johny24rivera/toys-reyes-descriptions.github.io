    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RID2015 warrior version
of Quillfire. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of RID2015
warrior Quillfire

     Scatterspike in the show
uses the same body as Quillfire, so it makes sense that her toy would be
a redeco of his. In vehicle mode, the color scheme is almost entirely a
very dark maroon-- it's a very good shade of the color, being milky and
semi-metallic with some glitter in there. Except for some of the more obvious
milky "swirls", it almost looks like a car finish. Black on Scatterspike
is used pretty much in the same spots as on Quillfire-- on the feet, waist,
wheels, head, and paint on the vehicle windows and on the faux window on
her robot chest. It works as a decent monochrome color, but along with
the maroon it makes the vehicle mode a bit too dark overall-- some lighter
colors were needed more, there. In robot mode, thankfully, she has a decent
amount of milky purple on her hands, upper legs, middle of the arms, her
quills, and on a few minor connector pieces. This is a pretty decent moderately
light shade of the color, and it contrasts very well against the maroon,
and makes her more Decepticon-y in her color scheme to boot. It really
makes the color scheme in robot mode not just more varied, but more aesthetically
pleasing. For paint, there's some yellow on the upper headlights, as well
as on the waist and the feet-- nice for some light coloration against all
the dark. There's some metallic purple on Scatterspike's eyes, and some
gunmetal gray on her eyebrows, jaw, and part of the front grill. Finally--
in a very unexpected but appreciated extra touch-- the rims of the tires
have a fairly light, jungle-y green color. It comes outta nowhere, but
it looks pretty good and helps the tires look a bit more unique.

     No mold changes have
been made to Scatterspike-- sadly not even her head, which is a real shame
because her head on the show is very obviously different from Quillfire's.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Scatterspike has a pretty
unique color scheme that is fitting for a 4WD in vehicle mode, but adds
some unique colors and paint apps to it, particularly in robot mode. Overall
I like her scheme more than Quillfire's, but without a new facemold she
sadly doesn't make for a completely satisfactory version of the character.
Instead, she looks more like Quillfire under a very dark light. Still,
if you want her, this is the only toy she's gotten-- and it's fairly rare
too, being only 1 to a case for one wave.
