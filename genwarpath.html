    Warpath's tank mode is
a bit hard to classify; it's not exactly realistic in its proportions,
but it has enough realistic detailing all over the place (vents, molded-in
ladders, a hatch molded on top of the turret for a person to (theoretically)
climb in, etc.) that I don't think it classifies as a "Cybertronian" tank,
either. Unfortunately, this means he looks like he should be more solid
than he is. Warpath is one of the regrettably several "H-tank" Transformers
that have been released in the past decade or so, with a visible gap in
between the front treads. Part of Warpath's back sticks out between the
rear treads, making it more like an "A-tank" with the back half just as
wide as the front (actually a little wider), though there are pretty visible
gaps in between the rear treads and the main body, too. There also isn't
any real back to the tank mode, either-- another minor downside, but they
all add up. There are definitely two different treads on each side of Warpath,
which fairly obviously correspond to his appendages, even if you haven't
seen him in robot mode. Even a little fold-out panel to close that gap
on each side would've really helped. The turret is well-done, though, being
able to rotate completely around in this mode, and the cannon can move
up and down. Warpath also has a spring-loaded missile launcher (which can
easily be accidentally fired) on the right side of the turret and a (non-firing)
missile pack on the left side. Both can rotate at a point slightly before
they join with the turret piece itself, so these don't have nearly as wide
a range of movement as the main cannon. The color scheme of dark, dull
red, and various shades of gray isn't particularly exciting, but it IS
accurate to G1 Warpath, and the dark glittery gray is a nice shade of that
color (not so much for the blah light milky gray). The silver paint apps
on the treads look great against the red as well, but most of said paint
apps aren't as visible in this mode as they are in robot mode. The "ZOW-333"
and "K4-90W" military-esque markings on the side are ingenious little nods
to Warpath's characterization, though, with him often saying words like
that ("ZOWIE!" and "KA-POW!") in the middle of his sentences.

    Warpath's transformation
is slightly more involved than it looks, but the overall robot mode design
is tons better than his iffy vehicle mode-- this was definitely the mode
that took design priority. It's basically a more bulked-up, "fiercer" version
of G1 Warpath, right down to the shortened tank cannon sticking out of
the center of his chest (when you push the turret in, his head flips up
into its robot mode position, in a nice little pseudo-gimmick). His head
sculpt is excellent, homaging his G1 self quite well while adding in some
extra deals to make him look tougher. The addition of a few metallic gold
paint apps helps to bring a little more color to this mode, though the
more visible paint apps help to do that as well. Other than the flap of
plastic behind his head, there's no vehicle mode extras at all in this
mode, with everything fiting into his "core" robot mode build quite solidly.
I love the generally bulkier proportions of his appendages (upper arms
excepted), though I have to say having a hollow gap in between his fists
and the top of his lower arms is a little distracting. Warpath's got excellent
articulation-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows,
slightly up-and-down at the wrists, and at the hips (at two points), knees,
and limited movement at his ankles. Given his wide feet and utter lack
of backheavyness, this all means you can get some pretty cool poses out
of him. In addition, Warpath has four places for C-clip weapons on him,
if you have any other Transformers with those kind of weapons-- there's
one point on each lower arm, and one on each lower leg (all four can also
be accessed in vehicle mode, to boot).

    Generations Warpath
is a fairly easy recommendation for fans of the character-- but if you're
not, there's several Generations toys that are better (though there's also
a fair number that are worse, of course). His robot mode is excellent in
nearly every way, but his vehicle mode is rather iffy and not as solid-looking
as a tank should be.

      Wherever the fight is, that's where
Warpath wants to be. His super heavy armor and powerful weapons mean he
doesn't have to worry about things like orders or tactics. He just heads
straight for wherever the fighting is heaviest, pouring fire into the enemy,
and hoping there's someone left standing to give him a good fight when
he gets there.
