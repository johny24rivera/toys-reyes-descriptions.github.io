    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Grimlock. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Grimlock

     Alternator Wheeljack,
just like his mold buddy Grimlock, is a Ford Mustang GT. But he's also
got a few mold changes of his own-- the rear spoiler has been made bigger,
and two of the headlights on the front bumper are gone, resulting in a
slightly different car model than Grimlock. And, of course, the robot head
has been remolded to highly resemble G1 Wheeljack's. The crests on the
side of the head are considerably smaller than his G1 self's, probably
both to make the head fit easier in its slot in vehicle mode and just because
when they were really big, they did make G1 Wheeljack look a bit dorkier.
Now he's got an almost mean look to him, what with the black optics and
all-- I really like it. No other mold changes have been made, so unfortunately,
Wheeljack still suffers from his front hood not fitting all the way down
very well in either of his modes, and his side doors also pop off a little
easily. As for the color scheme, Grimlock's red and silver have been replaced
with white and blue. The blue striped pattern on the top of the car mode
really catches the eye, and looks awesome next to the white. (Though I
have to wonder why Hasbro didn't opt for a green stripe, since that was
G1 Wheeljack's scheme-- I suppose Ford didn't want it.) There are also
smaller blue lines on the bottom of the side panels with MUSTANG written
inside them-- another nice touch, and helps differentiate Wheeljack from
Grimlock more by giving him more of a "racing" feel. The blue car seats
and robot waist are also more appetizing than Grimlock's light red coloration
used on those parts. Plus, Wheeljack's sword is colored all icy-like, and
looks AWESOME-- even if he didn't have a sword in his G1 version.

     Alternator Wheeljack
is an awesome remold of Grimlock. Though I do like Grimlock's silvery scheme
in car mode more, I think Wheeljack's blue parts look better than Grimlock's
light red parts and Wheeljack has more paint apps, so it all evens out--
both toys are just as good as the other, I think. A very highly recommended
toy, even if you already own Grimlock-- this is one of the best Transformer
molds out there, folks.
