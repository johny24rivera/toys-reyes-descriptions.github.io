    Masterpiece toys are
meant to emulate the original toy's appearance in the original G1 cartoon
accurately, and Masterpiece Prowl's toy certainly emulates his original
G1 Nissan police car mode extremely accurately, down the point where it
almost looks like an enlarged version of his
    <a href="g1prowl.html">
     G1
toy
    </a>
    in this mode. (Prowl is roughly voyager-sized, though considerably
more complex than your average voyager, as is the case with Masterpiece
toys.) The proportions are spot-on, and with the exception of the cannons
which can easily be seen inside Prowl's tinted windows, there aren't any
robot mode extras at all, either. (For a normal retail toy the visible
cannons wouldn't really bug me, but for a Masterpiece toy I was hoping
he'd have visual drivers' seats visible inside.) Prowl is quite literally
COVERED with paint in this mode, whether it's white or black paint, to
give him a more "car-like" finish and look, which I think is a really awesome
touch. His overall color scheme is white and black with a bit of silver
and red; it's not super-awesome or original, but it certainly fits a police
car and are Prowl's signature colors, with all the little deco bits like
the slight bulge in the side black stripes above the rear tires and the
"sweep" in the center front of his hood are all here, replicated perfectly
from the G1 toy. The "HIGHWAY PATROL POLICE" door emblems are also copied,
but in a bit more modernized of a font and a bit smaller proportionally;
his other "HIGHWAY PATROL" signs from the G1 toy have been eliminated for
his Masterpiece toy for a cleaner look, and I have to say it looks pretty
nice. I do miss a painted license plate, however-- that definitely should've
been filled in. The orange and dark red taillights and headlights are a
nice touch and contrast against the black well, and his transparent red
sirens are also a nice shade of the color. A really neat feature is that
Prowl's gun has an alterante handle that allows it to peg in behind these
sirens, in order to give Prowl a bit of firepower in this mode. Both of
his doors can swing out, though there's only robot bits inside so I don't
know why you'd want to. Although they look it, it's also worth noting that
Prowl's tires are NOT of the rubbery type of plastic-- which I'm okay with,
given the tendency for rubbery tires to split over time.

    Prowl's transformation
to robot mode is a bit complex-- as is the case with most Masterpiece toys--
but the end result is absolutely worth it. Prowl here looks about as accurate
to the G1 cartoon as you can get, with pretty much no proportional maladies
whatsoever (his doors are a tad small, but if you were to make them larger
they'd be too big for the car mode, so....). He's got the hood-chest, an
excellent and detailed spot-on headsculpt, well-proportioned arms with
the tires behind the shoulders, the door wings... it's pretty much all
good. The roof of his car mode does sit behind his back, and if you look
at him from a side view, it is a little far back, but given how it stays
out of the way and how well it folds up, this is a minor quibble at best.
I love love LOVE how his legs transform, giving us G1-accurate legs while
also giving him a wide range of motion at the ankles, complete with fold-out
panels to keep the visible gaps in his feet to a minimum! Those feet are
the most well-engineered part of this entire toy, in my opinion, and that's
saying something. He's also got little fold-out heels to keep him stable.
I will say that Prowl's cannons are too small proportionally, however--
I don't want them to be obnoxiously oversized like they were on the G1
toy, but perhaps about twice the size of what they are on this toy would
have been ideal. They're just too small to look like formidable launchers,
here. Gunmetal gray makes itself known in this mode on some of Prowl's
robot bits, adding another nice color to the scheme which complements the
black and contrasts against the white well. The red headcrest and blue
eyes are also spot-on and look great against the fairly serious look on
his face. The other couple of paint apps on his waist look nice against
the black as well. As you'd expect from a Masterpiece toy, Prowl has incredible
articulation-- he can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders (at two
points), elbows (at three points), wrist rotation, movement at the base
of the fingers on each hand (all as one piece), rotation at the waist,
and movement at the hips (at three points), hip "flaps", knees (at two
points), and ankles (at two points). Given how well-balanced he is, this
means you get him into a ton of awesome poses. As you'd expect from his
finger movement, Prowl's gun also plugs into a slot for it in the palms
of his hands, with the fingers closing around the barrel to secure it in
place-- it's not quite as secure as a simple peg system, but it does its
job and looks better than a simple fist hole.

    For those wanting an
updated version of G1 Prowl, you can't reasonably ask for a better toy
than this. Sure, it has some VERY minor issues, like the small shoulder
cannons that are visible in vehicle mode, but any downsides are nitpicky
when compared to the overall product, which looks amazingly accurate in
both modes. He IS pretty expensive for the size, though, so this is definitely
something aimed more at collectors, especially when you consider the transformation--
this isn't a toy for young kids.

      Prowl is a clear thinker who is able
to see beyond the chaos of battle and discover the rational route to victory.
His logic center is the most sophisticated in the Autobot army, capable
of analyzing complex combat situations and making strategic decisions almost
instantaneously. Unexpected events have been known to briefly scramble
his circuits, but there isn't much this Autobot doesn't see coming. As
much as his fellow Autobots would like to see Prowl loosen up and crack
a joke once in a while, they recognize that what makes him so brilliant
on the battlefield is what makes him so disciplined off it.
