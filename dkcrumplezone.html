    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Crumplezone. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Cybertron Crumplezone

     Dark Crumplezone is technically
the same design as the original Crumplezone, with the same points of articulation,
general proportions, and (with the exception of the feet) and identical
transformation. However, as far as the mold is concerned, Dark Crumplezone
is 70-80% remolded from the original design, which practically makes him
a new mold. Nearly every major part is remolded-- following is a thorough
list of the parts changed, as some are more obvious than others:
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - First, and most obvious, the design of
the entire front cockpit area has been completely redone, with a more iron-poured,
"mean-looking" design, what with the slanted painted windows and molded-in
"rivets" and what not. Two (non-firing) guns have also been added to the
sides of the cockpit, though they are completely fixed in their set position.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The middle rear area of the vehicle mode
has also been completely redone, with, again a more mean-looking, "ironclad"
design, with molded in "rivets" and engine pipes. A Powerlinx port has
also been added to the top of this piece so that Crumplezone can interface
with some Minicons now.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The lower robot leg pieces have been
completely remolded, with large "wings" on the side and larger, longer
feet. Althoguh I think this setup looks better in vehicle mode than on
the original Crumplezone, since it makes it less obvious they're legs,
in the actual robot mode they look a bit too big and long, especially since
Dark Crumplezone has such short legs. Their transformation is also slightly
different-- you slide the lower legs down and THEN turn rotate the feet,
rather than just rotating the feet and being done with it.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The lower robot arms have also been completely
redone, with the same ironclad, riveted appearance that the rest of the
toy now sports. They're even bulker than they were before-- in some ways,
good because it beefs up Dark Crumplezone even more, but his fists also
are now partially covered up by said lower arms. Two little wing pieces
also come with the toy that attach to the sides of the lower arms, though
they do tend to come off a little easier than I'd like.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The rear vehicle mode flip-out "wings"
are slightly different, due more to the different lower arm pieces than
anything else. Because they're made of a more rigid transparent plastic,
however, they flip out of place even easier than on the original Crumplezone's.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The elbow pieces have been remolded,
with different detailing.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The transparent parts on the missile
launchers have been remolded slightly into a more angular appearance. (Unfortunately,
the missile launchers are still slightly uneven with each other.)
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - Even though it may not look it on first
glance, Dark Crumplezone's head is also new, with different detailing on
the forehead.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The sound made when you insert the Cyber
Key has been changed-- instead of a longer, "super-charged" weapon powering
up, a more quick "blasting" sound is produced. Although both are good,
I think I liked the first sound effect better.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     As for the color scheme,
I have no complaints at all-- black, brown, transparent orange, and silver-gold
are an AWESOME color combination on this toy, and make Dark Crumplezone
truly look like an evil monster. All the colors are used in just the right
amount, too, so there isn't too big of a patch of any one color anywhere.
Dark Crumplezone also has his fair share of paint apps-- I especially like
the wicked angular "flame" deco on the front cockpit and wings, as well
as the front part of the robot arms.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Dark Crumplezone is
a very heavily remolded toy, with lots of awesome new paint and mold details,
a really evil-looking, more toughened look, and one of the line's best
color schemes. There's really nothing not to recommend-- buy this awesome
toy, even if you have the original Crumplezone!

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       With dark power coursing through his
circuitry, his might in battle is nearly unmatched, but Dark Crumplezone
is just as dumb as ever. Being dead gave him a mean streak a mile wide,
and getting put back together by the otherworldly power of Galvatron gave
him the weaponry he needed. What he can't smash through, he knocks down,
and what he can't knock down, he pulverizes with his forward plasma ejector
cannons. He's too dumb to be a real threat to the Autobots, but Galvatron
is content to just set him loose on the battlefield and see what he can
blast before the Autobots shut him down.
