    Shockblast's vehicle
mode is a futuristic cannon tank. Although some parts of it border on passable,
for the most part, this mode is pretty poor. When I look at it, I don't
see a tank; I see Shockblast's robot mode contorted into an odd position.
In fact, if it wasn't for the treads on the bottom, I'd swear this was
a fan-created mode and not an official one. It's pretty obvious that his
legs are just pushed together for the front bottom area of the tank mode,
while his right hand is just folded in on itself, with a large plastic
dual-gun shell on top of it that, while giving Shockblast some extra firepower,
does a poor job disguising the hand right underneath it. Shockblast's robot
head is also just rotated a bit so the lone eye isn't visible, even though
the rest of the head is. Yeah, like THAT makes a big difference... The
tank as a whole also doesn't look very solid; there's visible gaps in between
many of the parts, which shouldn't be there for a mode as solid as a tank,
for Primus' sake. The two rear treads also don't have any mass in between
them, and they're overly flat themselves, so they don't help the image
much, either. On the plus side, though, Shockblast's color scheme couldn't
be better; the purple and gray not only look great, but are a great homage
to G1 Shockwave (which Shockblast is obviously supposed to be an updated
version of). The green gives Shockblast a bit more variety, and also ties
him in with the whole "green Decepticon Energon" theme the bad guys in
this line have. He's also got plenty of paint apps and mold detailing-
I especially like the purple "M"-like pattern on the otherwise transparent
green parts that become his chest in robot mode- it looks really, really
nice. His cannon also is big, tough-lookin', and is a pretty cool gimmick
in and of itself. Push the black lever forward, and a "charging up" sound
is emitted continuously until you push it forward all the way, in which
a final "firing" sound is emitted, the front green claws open up, the green
mini-solar panels open up, and the missile fires. It looks really cool,
and it definitely looks like Shockblast could do some serious damage with
it. The black lever can be a bit touchy at times, but it's not too annoying.

    Shockblast's base mode
(it's not a satellite, according to the instructions) doesn't fare any
batter than the cannon mode, sadly. It still looks too much like his robot
mode in an odd position- the robot legs, head, and arm are still just as
obvious as they were in his cannon mode. The perk to this mode, though,
are all the hidden solar panels that you fold out- they have chrome gold
detailing on them, so they look pretty cool. There's also detailing on
some of the parts revealed that shows various buttons and (non-firing)
rocket launchers, so Shockblast has quite the artillery in this mode. His
lone Powerlinx port- on the back of his hand- is revealed in this mode,
although I'm not sure WHAT the big piece of plastic hanging off his hand
is supposed to be in this mode- some kind of weird-shaped solar panel?
Anyways, I'm not sure why the Powerlinx port is on the back of the hand,
instead of on top of the large flat plastic piece attached to it, which
would have made the port easily accessible in all modes. Overall, though,
the base mode doesn't really look like anything more than an odd configuration
of the robot parts- not at all like a satellite, and even less like an
actual base.

    The robot mode, though,
is where Shockblast really shines. Almost nothing is wrong with this mode,
but there are a few minor things, so let's get those out of the way first.
His gun arm is a bit too large proportionally, for one thing. In fact,
it's actually longer than Shockblast is tall- which makes it impossible
to leave that arm in a vertical position in this mode. There's also no
real elbow articulation on that arm, given the hugeness of the gun, so
Shockblast has limited articulation in that area of his body. The arm is
also so heavy when compared to the rest of Shockblast's body that he tends
to lean a bit to that side in many positions. Shockblast does have feet
that I think are a little too big, but this helps to keep him more stable
in lieu of that big gun-arm, so I suppose they're needed. Shockblast has
excellent articulation excluding the gun-arm, though- he can move at the
head, antennae, shoulders (at two points), elbow (at two points, on the
right arm), the finger of his claw-hand, his waist, his hips (at two points),
his knees (at two points), and his ankles. So you can get him into a fair
number of poses, even with his heavy left arm. Shockblast's robot head
is very well-detailed, and I can't think of a better look for an updated
version of G1 Shockwave. He still has that cold, emotionless eye for a
face, only now it has some pretty good light piping, so you can have that
lone eye glow eerily in places with even a modest amount of lighting. The
elongated head and long antennae help Shockblast fit in with the rest of
the Energon Decepticons, who for the most part have a rather sleek look.
As should be the case, given his alternate modes, Shockblast has practically
no vehicle extras in this mode (assuming the large gun is supposed to be
a major part of this mode anyways); the only real thing that could be considered
an extra is his tread "backpack" but this blends in so well with the rest
of his body and doesn't get in the way, so it really doesn't subtract from
anything at all. Shockblast also has a "hyper mode", but all you really
do is fold out solar panels from his back, so it's really not even a mode
at all. It looks cool, though. Shockblast's Decepticon spark crystal is
between his head and left shoulder.

    Y'know, I REALLY wanted
to give Shockblast a "must buy" rating, but then I realized that I'd just
be giving him the high rating because he's a new version of Shockwave (my
favorite G1 character), and not on the toy's merits itself. So, going just
from a toy perspective, the robot mode rocks, but the alternate modes are
pretty poor. I would've easily gone for a slightly-less-impressive robot
mode if it meant more believable vehicle modes. HIGHLY recommended for
Shockwave fans, though, as he's a pretty good update.

      Shockblast is a cunning Decepticon warrior
and scientist. In robot mode, this cold strategist uses his particle beam
cannon to blast an enemy within a ten-mile radius. His incredible vision
and acute hearing make him the greatest Decepticon tactician and marksman
that ever was. In his alternate mode of a military satellite, Shockblast
is able to send a wide array of information between Earth and Cybertron
and is capable of jamming Autobot transmissions and defensive grids.
