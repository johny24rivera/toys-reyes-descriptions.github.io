not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Tread Bolt (I'll never
understand why they keep giving that name to a
     <i>
      jet
     </i>
     ) is a partial
homage to the G1 micromaster of the same name, as G1 Treadbolt was a primarily
dark blue stealth bomber. It's not a perfect fit by any means, but I'll
take any obscure Micromaster homages I can get. Tread Bolt's color scheme
seems largely inspired by the Blue Angels, being dark blue with some really
dynamic, slanted stripes along the edges of his wings in vehicle mode.
He also has "Air Defense" emblems on the main body of his jet mode, which
are similar to the "Air Force" emblems on G1 Tread Bolt. The light gray,
black and brown serve as excellent secondary colors (which are considerably
more visible in robot mode), and add quite a bit of a variety to Tread
Bolt's color scheme beyond just the blue and yellow. He also has plenty
of paint apps, pretty much all of which are well-placed-- the bright orange
details on his robot legs and thrusters really contrast well, and I love
love LOVE the silver-painted helmet in robot mode. Unfortunately, there
are a few minor paint apps I would've changed-- I don't like the dark blue
face, for one, it just looks odd. I'm also not fond of where they placed
the Autobot symbol-- it's right behind the cockpit in vehicle mode, with
some mold detailing indents basically blocking out the eyes on the symbol,
which makes it look pretty weird. Another color choice I'm not fond of
is the transparent brownish-amber used for the missiles and the cockpit
windows-- it's just an ugly color.

     Universe 2.0 Tread Bolt
is a great mold with a great color scheme. A few minor things, such as
the head and the transparent plastic color, I would have done different,
but overall he's well worth the $20 price point and looks a lot better
than any other color scheme this mold has received. Highly recommended.

       Tread Bolt is a ghost. Though he is
an aerial ace, his real talent lies in stealth. Special sensor-refractive
armor renders him invisible to all but the most sophisticated detection
technology. Silent, super-precise lasers let him take out enemy spotters
before they can shout a warning. More than a few Decepticons have been
blown to pieces before they ever even heard him coming. He has alienated
a lot of his fellow Autobots, because when he's not sneaking up on Decepticons,
he creeps around scaring the heck out of anyone he can find.
