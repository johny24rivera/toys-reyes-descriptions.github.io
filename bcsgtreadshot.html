not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Special

     Shattered Glass Treadshot
here is a bit of an obtuse homage. On first glance, given the color scheme
one might think he's an homage to
     <a href="arsideswipe.html">
      Armada Sideswipe
     </a>
     --
and indeed, if you put an Autobot sticker over his Shattered Glass Decepticon
symbol, he functions pretty well as one (even if the car mode is way more
aerodynamic than Armada Sideswipe's). However, the reason he's a Decepticon
named Treadshot here is, A, there's already a
     <a href="bcsideswipe2.html">
      Shattered
Glass Sideswipe
     </a>
     ; and B, there was a Universe 1.0
     <a href="biabmagnustread.html">
      "Battle
in a Box"
     </a>
     set that featured a Decepticon redeco of Armada Sideswipe
with an oddly reddish Decepticon symbol versus Ultra Magnus. Since Shattered
Glass Ultra Magnus is in this set, that little feud between rivals has
now carried over into actual fiction beyond a store exclusive versus set!
However, since this is "Shattered Glass" after all, Treadshot has Armada
Sideswipe's color scheme, though he does still have Universe Treadshot's
silver stripes on one side of his vehicle mode. As for the colors themselves,
they're spot-on Armada Sideswipe-- they got the shades of the colors down
perfectly. The dull sky blue is a particularly nice shade, though the orange-yellow
has never been one of my favorite colors, and this toy does nothing to
change that opinion-- in fact, due to the plastic sprue layout, there's
a bit of yellow that shows through on the sides of the car mode, which
looks a little unsightly. All that said, the yellow and blue ARE complementary
colors, and the black serves as a nice "go-between" color. There's also
several paint apps on Treaddshot, including the bright orange taillights
and red headlights, that are present on Armada Sideswipe. His rear window
in vehicle is also painted-- a relative rarity for this mold. It's a bright
yellow paint and totally doesn't mesh with the transparent dull yellow
used for his actual transparent plastic, but it's better than nothing,
to be sure.

     Treadshot has a new
headsculpt, though it's not one Fun Publications (the folks who run Botcon)
created-- rather, it was one of the alternate heads created initially for
the mold, but was simply never used until now. Repurposing this new head
as Treadshot/Sideswipe works remarkably well, with the few differences
making his headsculpt look better, not worse. However, on the downside,
this head sculpt is just a smidge to wide, to the point where the chest
doesn't come down over it
     <i>
      quite
     </i>
     all the way in robot mode, which
can be mildly annoying.

     Shattered Glass Treadshot
is a great mold and a nice nod for people who might like really obscure
homages or Armada Sideswipe's character, but wanted a better toy of him.
However, the color scheme (though not bad) isn't particularly exciting
to me, and it really feels like they were stretching on this homage. This
is definitely one of the weakest uses of this mold.

       Before the war, before the factions,
there were only Cybertronians. Treadshot and Ultra Magnus were both apprentices
to Treble and Gain, the legendary weapons masters, and the two students
often competed in a friendly rivalry to prove who was the strongest and
fastest. When Ultra Magnus joined his brother Optimus Prime in causing
rampant chaos, Treadshot knew he could not follow. Instead, during the
second Cybertronian war when Megatron rose to lead an opposing army, Treadshot
joined the Decepticons. His decision was viewed by Ultra Magnus as the
ultimate betrayal. Their rivalry turned vicious. Each time they met on
the battlefield, both would attempt to finally end the feud by extinguishing
the other. Now with Ultra Magnus freed from his prison on Paradron, Treadshot
must lead a Decepticon task force to bring his former friend to justice.
Treadshot carries dual sonic accelerators and a powerful pulse demagnetizer
in honor of his former mentors.
