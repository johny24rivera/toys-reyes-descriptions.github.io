    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics "Ultimate Battle"
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics
"Ultimate Battle" Megatron

     This Megatron mold's
"Special Editon" redeco has been redone to look more in like with Megatron's
G1 colors... except considerably more visually interesting. Although Special
Edition Megatron doesn't have as much silver as some other versions of
Megatron-- most of that "silver" is now a light gray plastic-- he more
than makes up for it in other ways. He's no longer just a monochrome gray/silver
and black-- he has a healthy amount of red on him besides just the "internal
bits" of the G1 toy, which REALLY makes the toy as the secondary color
adds a lot of much-needed contrast to the classic Megatron color scheme
without looking gawdy. What impresses me the most about this figure, however,
are the sheer number of paint apps. The extra $5 or so you spend on this
figure isn't just all spent on the packaging, folks-- no large spot on
Special Edition Megatron is left untouched by paint. Yeah, he doesn't have
a whole lot of major colors, but they're all alternated in such a nice,
consistent manner-- from the black "ribs" on the front of the tank to the
black-and-silver painted gray parts to the gray tread-wheels to the red
details on the robot legs and shoulders-- you don't really notice. He also
has a couple of accent colors that are only used in a few places, like
the yellowish green on his pelvis and tank "headlight" and the bright orange
on a couple small accent paint apps. I really love stuff like that-- it
shows the extra mile was taken in making Megatron look truly like a "Special
Edition" piece. My only minor quibble is that the light gray paint doesn't
quite match the light gray plastic, though this is only obvious when comparing
the front and rear halves of the tank mode-- in other cases, the light
grey paint and light grey plastic aren't adjacent, so it's not nearly as
apparent.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Special Edition Megatron
is a superb repaint, not just because it's a G1 homage, but because he's
got loads of paint apps on him and the addition of a fair amount of visible
red into the color scheme really makes it stand out. Recommended over the
original, even at the slightly-inflated price.
