    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Classics Terrorsaur
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Classics Terrorsaur

     Dualor's a pretty odd
release, being a Transformer that goes from animal-to-robot in a line that
has no such Transformers on-screen. Regardless, judging from the paint
job and alt mode, Dualor is a pretty big nod to G1 Grimlock, but apparently
not named Grimlock because hey, they might do something with a name that
big later. Anyways, the gray would look pretty blah by itself, but thankfully
there's a pretty good amount of that nice metallic bronze paint used on
his midsection, as well as on part of his toes and the bottom of his dino
neck. The light red plastic, another Dinobot-y touch, works well in the
relatively small "connector piece" places that it's used, and contrasts
excellently with both colors. The black head and dark blue optics also
work equally well with their surrounding colors. About the only issue I
have with Dualor's color scheme are his white dino arms; they really don't
"fit" overall and look odd (like he's wearing gloves), and are inaccurate
to G1 Grimlock to boot. They seem like a waste of two perfectly good paint
apps.

     Dualor is a pretty easy
buy if you like Dinobots and/or Minicons, given the relatively cheap price.
I'm not going to pretend he fits in with the rest of the Dark of the Moon
line, though-- and though color-wise he beats out Classics Terrorsaur,
I still think

     is
the best color scheme this mold has had so far.
