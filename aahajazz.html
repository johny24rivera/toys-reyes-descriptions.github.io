    Despite the fact that
he died in the first movie, Movie Jazz is stil getting toys even after
Revenge of the Fallen. Well, I can't say he doesn't need one-- Movie Jazz'
previous toys have been rather medicore. His Human Alliance toy has a MIGHTY
impressive Pontiac Solstice vehicle mode, for starters. The proportions
are spot-on, and best of all, he's covered in an extremely eye-catching
shade of gunmetal gray metallic paint. It really makes his car mode looks
"real", lights play off of it QUITE well. The transparent aquamarine windows
also give some pop to his vehicle mode, as they give a bit of color variety
to it (though with the main color being this nice to look at, I'm not complaining
that much about it). There's no real robot mode extras, though if you want
to nit-pick you can SLIGHTLY see a few flaps at the bottom of the rear
of this mode. At the Human Alliance scale, there's tons of really nice
details they were able to work in that they couldn't with smaller versions
of Jazz- the clear headlights, a rear window (!), and of course, the detailed
interior that's become the whole point of the Human Alliance subline. Both
doors can open up, and the Captain Lennox figure fits quite snugly in Jazz'
seat cushions. (The Lennox figure has all the standard articulation of
the Human Alliance human figures-- no surprises here. Though I don't know
what's up with his blond hair-- Lennox has brown hair, not blond!) To compensate
for his slightly smaller-than-average size in the Human Alliance category
(which is accurate, compared with the scale of the other cars in the line),
Jazz comes with a sleek-looking motorcycle. It's very well-proportioned
and with lots of mold detailing (though sadly not much of it has paint
detailing besides the gunmetal gray on the sides). A missile connects firmly
on one side of it, looking like an extra-long tailpipe, which is a bit
creative. Unfortunately, Human Alliance human figures can only grab onto
its tiny handlebars with their teeny hands, as there isn't any peg placement
to hold them firmly in place on the motorcycle, as there is in Jazz' seat
cushions. It doesn't have a kickstand, but the transformation bits, plus
the missile, give it enough stability to stand up on its own (though if
you push it or shake the table it's on very hard, it'll still fall over).

    In robot mode, Jazz
also looks surprisingly good considering how flawless his vehicle mode
was, but it still does have a few downsides-- we'll cover those first.
Firstly, the proportions-- while much better than on his other toys-- are
still a bit off. The middle of his legs is probably the worst, as they're
really skinny in the middle, yet proportionally accurate at the hips and
feet. His lower arms are also pretty darned skinny and rather two-dimensional--
being made up of just his car doors-- but they still look solid. Jazz also
does have most of his roof bits hanging behind his body like a backpack,
but it thankfully stays out of the way of movement and isn't so incredibly
large that it is an eyesore. His waist also connects with his chest at
a slight angle, but it's not so bad where it's immediately obvious. Jazz'
features are myriad-- his color scheme is broken up a bit more by black
and a really nice shade of copper (both in terms of paint and plastic),
and he has TON of mold detailing, nearly all of it accurate, with "pistons"
and "pumps" galore. The headsculpt is simply amazingly done, whether you
decide to leave his visor down or push it up via the lever on the back
of the head to reveal his "real", avian-like face. This is also the only
movie Jazz toy to get the hands right, with all four claws on each hand
positioned equally around the center point. There are also some really
neat little touches that didn't have to be done that I still appreciate
immensely, such as the additional pieces on the top of his chest that you
angle upwards to give it a more "fragmented" look; the gun that flips over
his left shoulder; and the insane amount of mold and paint detailing put
into his hips and lower legs. Unlike most Human Alliance toys in robot
form, Jazz doesn't really have many places for his human partner to occupy,
but Lennox can still occupy Jazz' motorcycle-gun, albeit in a somewhat
odd manner. And speaking of the motorcycle-gun-- BRILLIANT way to give
Jazz his signature weapon seen in the movies without attaching it in some
weird way to his vehicle mode. It' a very simple transformation for the
accessory, but works well and is fairly accurate if you ignore the wheels.
Jazz can hold it fairly firmly via a peg/hole system on each of his lower
arms. As for articulation, Jazz can move at the neck, shoulders (at two
points), elbows (at three points), at the central point where all his four
fingers on each hand move around; and at the hips (at two points), and
knees (at three points). His shoulder-gun can also move at three points.
So although he's missing a few points like the waist and ankles, in general
he's pretty posable and stable. (It should be noted, however, that the
vehicle pieces on the back of his hips to restrict movement a little there,
due to the backpack pieces right behind them.)

    Human Alliance Jazz
is definitely the quinessential version of this character, with not only
a ton of features and some REALLY nice metallic paint, but some cool accessories,
good articulation and movement, and excellent detailing. He does admittedly
have a few somewhat minor proportions issues in robot mode, but these aren't
that bad. Highly recommended.

      Against the massed forces of the Decepticons,
it will take every bit of power and ingenuity Autobot Jazz and Captain
Lennox have to win. Though the two soldiers have only just met, they are
both experienced fighters, used to working in synch with others. They easily
team up to focus all their fire on a single, huge Decepticon, and bring
him crashing down.
