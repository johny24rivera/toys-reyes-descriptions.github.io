    Finally, Cosmos gets
a new mold for the first time since his original G1 incarnation! In vehicle
mode, Cosmos gets a few awesome marks of coolness just because he's a UFO.
His DISGUISE is a UFO (more specifically, a flying saucer). Which is so
stupid it goes right back around to being awesome. Staying true to his
G1 roots, his color scheme is primarily dark gree, with a bit of red and
yellow poking through, which both accent the main color fairly well. There's
alsos ome nice "alien writing" paint apps around half of the top of this
mode, which looks pretty nifty. In addition, there's a barely-noticeable
dull silvery-blue cockpit paint detailing on the "front" of the UFO, with
thin lines of the same silvery-blue around the entire circumference of
the mode. However, the dull silvery-blue blends in too easily with the
dark green and thus only really stands out under juuust the right light.
He also has a yellow tailfin on the opposite end of the cockpit, thus giving
this mode a definitive "front" and "back" end. I don't know how I feel
about that, since one of the cool things about being a flying saucer is
NOT having an obvious front and back... There are no robot extras whatsoever
in this mode, unless you count the top of Cosmos' head sticking out in
the middle of this mode, but it's sort of Cosmos' "thing" and it plausibly
fits in with the silouhette of the UFO, so I don't mind it.

    Cosmos' robot mode is
short and bulky, just like his G1 form, and the (well-done) head sculpt
is practically identical. I also love all the little details on his chest--
they really help to breka up his mostly chunky, curvy figure. His legs
look pretty good as well, and his wide feet give him very nice stability.
His tailfin sticks out of his butt, though, which just looks odd. My biggest
problem with this mode-- and, indeed this toy-- is that the entire arms
are just molded into big bulky portions of the vehicle mode. Granted, at
this scale some sacrifices undoubtedly had to be made if you wanted to
get a good UFO mode out of it, but still, it just looks bad. Maybe even
just having the outer part of the arm-shells split and rotate up to become
shoulder panels would've cut down on their ridiculous bulkiness. The forced
curve in them looks rather weird, too. Mostly because of this, Cosmos also
has pretty limited articulation-- he can move at the shoulders, hips, and
knees, but that's it (though the knees have a pretty good range of movement,
being on unobstructed ball joints).

    Universe 2.0 Cosmos
is a fun, goofy little figure, being a tiny UFO robot and all. It's more
a novelty item than a bonafide "cream of the crop" Transformer, which is
probably why it appeals to so many people (and I can't say I'm resistant
to its charms either). Its UFO is pretty good (minus the tailfin), but
those arms in robot mode... ick. Mildly okay for a Legends figure and a
recommended pickup if you want a UFO transformer, but if you're looking
for a Legends toy based purely on its engineering merits you'd best look
somewhere else.
