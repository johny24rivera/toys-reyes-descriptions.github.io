    Brawn here is a bit of
a "light" homage to his G1 self, though this is more apparent in his robot
mode. In vehicle mode, all he really shares with his G1 namesake is he's
got a heavy-duty mode and he's an Autobot. The military SUV alt mode works
really well given the "N.E.S.T. Global Alliance" subline he's in-- and,
of course, he has the Global Alliance symbol emblazed on both sides of
this mode. Unfortunately, there are few other paint apps in this mode--
the headlights and taillights are painted, thankfully, but that's more
or less it. He's got plenty of mold detailing too, which makes it a bit
more of a shame-- at least a few more silver paint apps really would've
added to the contrast in this mode. And given how dark-colored it is otherwise,
it could've used some. Proportionally this mode is great, however, and
there's no real robot mode extras. Brawn's feet stick out just a TAD below
the buttom bars, but that's getting nit-picky. (The tinted windows are
too dark to let you see his robot parts inside.) Brawn's roof-mounted gun
can move up-and-down for some aerial aiming. A more obscure feature on
him is that nearly all of the "bars" on his vehicle mode-- the bottom bars,
all the ones near the rear end, and the bars across his rear "window"--
are sized to fit the 3mm clip weapons that
    <a href="rotfironhiderec.html">

    introduced into the Transformers line. Granted, Brawn doesn't
have any of those weapons himself, but if you want to beef up this mode
more, it's an option.

    The first thing I noticed
about Brawn's robot mode is that it has some DARN cool-looking robot parts.
The head design is extremely well-done and menacing without being outright
evil like some of the Decepticon head designs-- and the dome part of the
head is a bit of a nod to G1 Brawn. Brawn's got some excellent detailing
on his chest and waist in particular, almost like robo-ribs. His "Mech
Alive" gimmick is evident here, as well-- rotate his shoulders up and gears
inside his chest will rotate with it. He's also got some beefy, stocky
arms, which certainly fits his character, and he actually transforms with
his guns already in-hand, which is pretty nifty. (The guns can be removed
from his fists easily if you want, though.) The cannon from vehicle mode
now hangs over over his head, giving him even more firepower. His legs
are basically "goat legs", bending backwards a bit at the knees and having
hoof-like details on the actual feet. I think it fits him pretty well,
and if you don't like the whole bending-backwards bit at the knees, there
are joints that let you all but eliminate it from his stance. His color
scheme takes a bit of a note from G1 Brawn in this mode, with the dark
green and a bit of gray. Adding in the golden-tinted green on the chest
and upper arms helps to up the contrast even more-- what Brawn was lacking
in color in vehicle mode, he definitely makes up for it in robot mode,
both in terms of the different plastic colors and the ample amounts of
paint detailing on him. However, there is the elephant in the room that
I've ignored up until now, and it's pretty much what keeps Brawn from being
a nigh-perfect figure-- he's got a LOT of alt mode kibble in robot mode.
Huge panels hanging way off his back, bits of his front hanging off the
sides of his upper arms, parts of his roof underneath his lower arms, and
big panels of part of his vehicle mode's rear hanging off his shoulders.
The front bumper bits sit nicely on his knees, and the bits underneath
his lower arms are minor, but the rest just kinda hangs there without a
place to "peg in" and really gets in the way of a lot of articluation,
not to mention it doesn't look all that great (particularly from a side
view). As for movement, Brawn can move at the neck (at two points), shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two places), his wrists and waist can rotate,
and he can move at the hips (at two points), the knees, and the ankles
(at two points). Lateral movement at the elbows and knees is all he's technically
missing, but again, all those pieces of kibble hanging off of him can interfere,
particularly at the waist.

    Brawn has a near-perfect
(if dull-looking) vehicle mode, and his robot mode has a ton of nice features
and some cool detailing and weapons. However, those of you who don't like
kibble are really going to have difficult time getting over all of it in
robot mode-- it's a shame, because otherwise he's a stellar and unique
'bot, but all those pieces hanging off him keep him from getting the "must-buy"
rating of 9.0+. Still mildly recommended, though.

      There's nothing Brawn loves more than
a challenge. Luckily, working with the N.E.S.T. Global Alliance gives him
plenty of opportunities to show his strength. He has a new assignment:
Track down the Decepticon strong-bot Rampage. The Decepticon warrior's
strength is legendary, but Brawn intends to crush both him and his legend
with a couple blows of his indestructible fists.
