    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Tracks. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Tracks

     Making Ravage an Alternator
is certainly an... interesting choice, to say the least. First off, the
mold changes-- there actually aren't many when compared to the other remolds.
One of the mold changes that I can see are that the hood of the vehicle
mode has been removed, thus making Ravage a Chevrolet Corvette convertible.
Though I wish they had also removed the shallow pegs on the top of the
windshield, too... without a hood to cover them up, they kinda stick out
from the otherwise streamlined, curved shape of the windshield. The other
mold change, obviously, is the robot head-- it's now
     <a href="g1soundwave.html">
      G1
Ravage's
     </a>
     head. The mouth can also open and close slightly, though he
can't open it up all the way. Making Ravage as just a remold of Tracks
rather bugs me, though. I mean, there's a TON of G1 car Transformers. Why
Ravage, of all 'bots? He was a cougar in one mode, a tape in the other!
Now, I can understand changing the characters to a certain extent-- I wouldn't
have had any problem at all if Ravage had changed from a car into an actual
robotic panther. But he's now a humanoid car-bot with just a cougar face!
It just looks so totally out of place. I mean, they could have at least
remolded the hands and feet to make them more claw-like, or make SOMETHING
animalistic about Ravage besides just his face. I mean, even Ravage's short
appearance in the Beast Wars cartoon show gave him other animalistic characteristics--
he had a smooth, feline form, and a tail. Alternator Ravage has none of
that. As for the color scheme, though, it's awesome-- black, gray, and
that great metallic red go together exceptionally well and are, of course,
fitting for Ravage.

     Alternator Ravage has
a great color scheme, but the character just should not have been made
into an Alternator. The feline face is just too out of place, and it's
not a fitting update of the character, especially when you consider how
many other G1 car 'cons are still out there, waiting for an update. As
such, even though I like the color scheme itself better than Tracks', I
can't bring myself to recommend him over the former, because it's just
too weird seeing Ravage transform from a car to a humanoid robot with a
cougar head...
