    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Scourge.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron

     Classics Trypticon is
a repaint homage to the G1 giant dinosaur-land base Decepticon of the same
name. A repaint homage is really all it is, though-- considering that the
original Trypticon was a dinosaur, not a dragon, and he didn't have a robot
mode, the color scheme is the only thing common between the two. The color
scheme itself is decent enough, especially when looked at in beast mode.
The gray would look rather dull by itself, but thankfully Trypticon's got
four other colors thrown into the mix as well. The light purple looks especially
good against the other colors, and is definitely a "Decepticony" color
if there ever was one. The orange also contrasts very nicely against the
purple and gray. The greyish white is a nice color by itself, but I wish
it were used somewhere else besides just the smaller two dragon heads and
the robot face-- maybe on the tail or back or something. Plus, the greyish
white on the face just makes him look sick or zombie-ish or something--
maybe using purple there would have worked better. The only color I'm not
fond of at all is the sea foam green on the chest-- yes, it was on the
original Trypticon toy, but it's still a very ugly color that doesn't fit
in with the others at all. That should have just been removed from the
equation all together and maybe white or orange could have taken its place
instead.

     Trypticon is a pretty
nice repaint of Scourge, with quite a few paint apps for such a small figure.
With the exception of that ugly sea foam green, all of the colors blend
together very well, too-- recommended over LoC Scourge.
