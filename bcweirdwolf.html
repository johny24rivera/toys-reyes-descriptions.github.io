    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Snarl. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Snarl

     What's sorta funny about
Weirdwolf is that his colors aren't really very different from Cybertron
Snarl's-- it's just the amount of each and their respectively layout that's
different. Weirdwolf is predominantly yellow with some white and blue accents,
while Snarl is predominantly white with some yellow and blue accents. Overall,
though, Weirdwolf definitely has the louder color scheme of the two. Granted,
this is obviously on purpose, as it more closely approximates G1 Weirdwolf's
color scheme than Snarl's, but that doesn't make it look any better. An
orange-yellow and greenish-blue wolf is not only completely unrealistic,
it's a horrid color combo in general. The white goes nicely against the
greenish-blue, but that's about the only good thing I'd have to say about
Weirdwolf's various colors. The accent colors of light red and transparent
orange don't provide enough contrast against the yellow and are also bright
colors, so they don't help much. There's a few spots of dark blue on Weirdwolf,
but they aren't in a large enough amount to detract from the loudness of
the color scheme.

     No mold changes have
been made to Weirdwolf-- heck, he still has Snarl's Cyber Key code on the
back of his own Key...

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Weirdwolf is a pretty
good mold, but Snarl's color scheme, though not perfect, is worlds better
than Weirdwolf's very loud, ugly colors. Granted, I can't realistically
expect anything different from the Botcon folks since that was how G1 Weirdwolf
LOOKED, but homage or not, it still doesn't look that great. Definitely
get the better-looking (and considerably cheaper) Snarl over this guy.

       When a league of Decepticons followed
Fortress Maximus to the planet Nebulos, Weirdwolf became one of the original
Headmasters under the command of Scorponok. While binary bonded to Monzo,
Weirdwolf was a Decepticon many would not dare cross. When recently assigned
to serve under the command of Bugbite, Weirdwolf became the subject of
an experiment to undo the Headmaster process. While on the surface it was
successful, many would argue that returning Weirdwolf to his "normal" Nebulan
free state has brought back a Decepticon who was anything but normal. Constantly
talking in double speak, sometimes making sense, while other times it would
appear that only "wolfie", the head of his beast mode, understands. It's
the ultimate case of talking to oneself.
