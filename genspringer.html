    At long last, Springer
gets a brand-new, triple-changing mold! This design is HEAVILY based off
of his form in the IDW comics, though it's certainly still very G1-ish
in its design. His first vehicle mode is a futuristic armored car. This
mode is remarkably solid, particularly for a triple-changer. The drivers'
windows are a little small proportionally, and the gray tabs on the back
end don't really look particularly convincing as a spoiler; also, the back
end is slightly hollow due to his transformation, and the gaps between
the thirds of his front hood are a bit more obvious than I'd like. That's
about it as far as downsides go, though; he's got well-sculpted headlights,
tires, and a fair amount of mold detailing, though this is definitely the
mold that's the lightest in that respect. There's no robot mode extras
to speak of in this mode, and his sword weapon from robot mode stores securely
underneath the car body. His general color scheme is classic Springer,
being mostly light green, yellow, and gray with some silver. Quite honestly,
accuracy aside, it's not a color scheme I'm all that fond of-- I've never
been a particular fan of yellow, and although it goes decently enough with
the green, the gray is the only real "dark" color here, and I wish there
was a darker, non-monochrome color for the other colors to play off of.
That said, it's certainly not BAD, just not really eye-catching. (I will
say I think the green tire hubs are a bit much, though.) The paint in this
mode is mostly relegated to some silver bits on the roof and a few minor
bits on the sides, but they do their job well enough-- his colors are generally
broken up well. That said, the yellow paint used on the the back-center
section of his front hood is noticeably lighter than the actual yellow
plastic, which is a minor eyesore. Springer's main weapon-- in this mode
and in his other two modes-- is a rather impressive double-barreled missile
launcher, both of which are launched via the pushing force you exert on
the gray slider near the back of the weapon. It has a 5mm port to store
compatible weapons behind the two barrels, and it also has an articulated
5mm peg that allows you to tilt the weapon up or down. Springer has two
5mm ports on the top of this mode for the weapon to stick into.

    Springer's helicopter
mode is the weakest of his three modes, but it's still surprisingly strong
for what is the undoubtedly "third mode" in terms of design priority. The
rear section elongates, giving Springer a pretty nice (if a bit thick)
tail; his car spoilers become convincing rear stabilizers; his side sections
move back a little and fold, revealing little wings; and, most, impressively,
the entire top section swings forward to all but eliminate the hood of
Springer's car mode. Springer's sword weapon is also split apart and pegged
onto the top of this mode, forming a propeller that springs quite well
and-- due to how the center green section slides into place-- is pretty
solid, too. There's even a little flip-down landing gear underneath the
cockpit nose, as well as two other landing gear that can fold down from
the bottom that form Springer's knee spikes in robot mode. The middle section
of this mode is where it's at its weakest, however-- the little wings that
fold out from the sides are too small even for a helicopter, and several
parts don't "lock in" securely in this mode, such as the back section of
his side panels and the tail to the main body, thus leaving the upper robot
legs a bit exposed in this mode. This said, the joints are tight enough
where this is a minor issue at best, particularly given that he's a triple-changer.
I also love how the rear wheels fold up against each other in the tail
section, with the mold detailing making them look more like rotary turbines
in this mode-- an ingenious way for the tires to pull "double duty" in
both modes. Heck, even the headlights on the sides fit with where you'd
expect those lights to be on a helicopter! Color-wise, a bit of grayish
white makes itself apparent in this mode, making the color scheme a bit
more varied but still wanting for a dark, non-monochrome shade of the color.

    Springer's robot mode
is impressive enough for a regular Transformer, but for a triple-changer?
The engineering here is mind-bogglingly amazing. Despite having two alt
modes, the only really blantant kibble are the spoiler/rear stabilizer
pieces on his lower legs, which really don't have anywhere to go. The other
vehicle parts complement the look of this mode nicely-- I love the small
wings on his lower arms, the wheels that form the core of his feet, the
way the middle section of his hood becomes his chest, and how the side
sections of his hood slide upwards and then at a diagnonal angle to give
him a more unique silouhette with long shoulder pads. Heck, even the bit
of his helicopter/car roof on his back is just barely wider than his waist,
and doesn't get in the way of movement at all. Springer's proportions are
also fantastic here, giving him a somewhat slim look in the legs but still
making him rather broad-shouldered and thick-armed, the vibe being both
power and elegance/skill, which is what the Wrecker leader is all about.
His headsculpt is spot-on IDW, nice and crisp and true to the character,
and literally one of the most accurate, nicest headsculpts on any TF I
own. All the necessary paint details on it pop, and there's a few more
paint apps for his waist as well. The mold detailing is also a bit more
substantial in this mode, with little details on places like his lower
arms, waist, and upper legs, though given his slightly more "toonish" look
in the IDW comics, it makes sense why he's not as detailed as most other
"Classics/Generations" toys. For articulation, Springer is also impressive,
being able to move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two
points), wrist and waist rotation, and at the hips (at two points), knees,
and slightly back-and-forth at the ankles. He's also quite stable, so he's
got a LOT of posability in him that would be impressive even if he wasn't
a triple changer. His sword weapon also looks quite solidly like a sword,
and not too much like a helicopter blade. I mean, really, this is just
a darned impressive mode.

Springer is THE toy to get of the character, bar none (at least as of this
writing in 1/16). It's hard to see how Hasbro will ever top this-- all
of his modes range from good (helicopter) to great (car) to utterly fantastic
(robot), and any downsides are minor at best and not at all annoying. Excellent
proportions, articulation, and looks; unless you're scared off by somewhat
complex transformations (it can take you a few times to memorize it, as
several pieces have a few different locking places due to his multiple
modes), this is a must-buy.

      Autobot Springer was built to be a tough
guy. Everything about him, from his nickel-plated blaster cannon to his
bad-boy attitude, is calculated to communicate exactly what he wants it
to-- that he's a no-holds-barred, take-no-prisoners kind of guy. He prefers
to fight alone, trusting his skills and luck to get him out of tight spots,
rather than relying on his fellow warriors. After all, other Autobots fail.
Autobot Springer never does.
