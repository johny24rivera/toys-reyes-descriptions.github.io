    Tailgate's alternate
mode is a sportscar, and is fairly basic all-around-- not bad, just basic
and not really one to stand out in a lineup of TFs. He's a fairly smooth-topped
sportscar that's a bit too skinny from the sides proportionally, especially
in comparison to his big wheels. (This was an issue with a lot of the first
Minibot molds IMO-- they were a bit *too* toy-like.) Due to the transformation,
the chrome knees are a bit obvious on the back end, with square holes for
them in said back end, but other than that there aren't any robot mode
extras in this mode. The mold details are VERY sparse, even by G1 standards.
There's some angular details on the middle of the front grill and hood,
but other than that the absolutely bare minimum of details iareused on
the rest of the car mode. Granted, the sunroof and several windows help
break up the midsection a bit, but still, some details like car door lines/handles
and some headlights/taillights would've been appreciated. There's only
one sticker in this mode-- the rub allegiance symbol in the center of the
front hood-- and no paint apps. The black plastic used for the windows
and wheels helps breakup the white a fair amount, and the grill is a nice
chrome, but some more stickers/paint on the hood and sides would've helped
vary up the very basic color scheme a bit more.

    To transform Tailgate
into robot mode, just slide the sides out to become his arms, and then
fold the back ends out and down to become his legs; you're done. The end
result is a nice "early prototype" for a lot of later small car Transformers,
and it's easy to see why this general transformation caught on; the proportions
are above-average for the size. The arms are rather skinny with only tiny
fist details on the very ends of them, which is one aspect of this transformation
that they definitely improved over time. The arms also connect to the body
closer to the elbows than the shoulders, which is weird. Still, the legs
are very good, with the car back end serving as nice lower legs and the
upper legs not being TOO small in comparison to them. The main body and
head are basically one large piece, with no real slimming between the chest
and head, though the car hood on the back of the butt means he widens out
a bit around the waist. It's a bit odd, but at least the silver head noticeably
sticks out from its surrounding parts, with an angular forehead with large
chin guards, a light blue visor, and a rather squarish faceplate with some
indentations on it. There's also some stickers-- an Autobot symbol on the
waist and some basic dial and vent details on the chest-- but there's no
other paint apps in this mode beyond the face. Still, with the addition
of a very dark dull teal to help add some color to the toy on the body
(as well as on the back of the lower legs) and more chrome silver on the
upper legs, his colors are more broken up in this mode and visually interesting.
For articulation, Tailgate can move back and forth at the elbow-shoulders,
as well as back at the knees (though given the transformation, if his lower
legs aren't pointing straight down, they're loose).

    The G1 toy of Tailgate
certainly has some oddities about it-- namely, the long body-head piece
in robot mode, as well as the very skinny arms-- but overall it's a solid
toy for the time, and it's rather interesting as a "precursor" for other
small car TFs to come. One of the best Minibot reissue molds out there,
overall.

      He sometimes has his mind stuck in low
gear, and believes the 55 mph speed limit is infringement on the rights
of cars. Garages are prisons to him... doesn't understand Earth machines
are not alive. Goes 180 mph, range 600 miles. Uses ferrocobalt magnet under
hood to be pulled by and within a few feet of other vehicles, reducing
his fuel use to near-zero. Prone to overheating.
