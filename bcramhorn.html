not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Ramhorn is another of
the "
     <a href="tripredacus.html">
      original Tripredacus
     </a>
     " members for this
gestalt boxset, with his original BW form being a beetle. A driller tank
fits a rhinocerous beetle somewhat well as a "pre-BW" form. That said,
like the other Tripredacus members, FunPub chose to base his color scheme
and head on how he appeared in "The Agenda, Part I" in the
     <i>
      Beast Wars
     </i>
     TV show. As such, his color scheme is fairly drab-- he's mostly a pale
red and a dull gray, with the gray being a more dominant color than on
the other two Tripredacus members. (It's worth noting that the red paint
doesn't look quite as light in person as it does in these pics.) Most of
the lower legs and arms are dull gray, along with the robot waist and a
few "guard rail" paint apps on the tank turret. In an homage to his beetle
form, Ramhorn has three "lightning bolt" patterns on each side of his tank
mode, which in a rather ingenious way mirrors the six legs of a beetle.
That said, little else distinguishes Ramhorn from being anything more than
a red driller tank. He does have a decent amount of silver-- the wheels
on his treads are all painted silver, as well as some parts on his lower
legs, his drill, and his robot chest. The silver helps to "shiny" things
up a little, even if color-wise it doesn't add much to the scheme. For
accent colors there's a really nice light green used on the windows of
his driller tank mode, which contrast so incredibly well with the red I
really wish they were used a bit more. Ramhorn also has a bit of light
orange on his waist and used for the eyes of his robot head, which contrasts
and complements the red well enough. Finally, there's just a little bit
of light milky gray used on his combiner port and a few minor connector
pieces-- it's a very bland color, but again, it's not used much.

     Ramhorn has a new headsculpt
to reflect how he looked in the show, and the actual head looks pretty
spot-on to the show. However, due to space constraints in tank mode, his
"bat ears" are pretty undersized and look off, and they're so small I do
worry a little about them breaking off inadvertently during transformation.
His head is also just a LITTLE flattened if looked at from a side angle,
but not enough to really bother me. Ramhorn also has the same drill weapon
accessory added to the mold for Combiner Wars Nosecone-- which is impressive,
given that Nosecone wasn't out yet at the time this set was made available.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     General Ramhorn's vehicle
mode fits his Beast Wars beetle form somewhat well, and the headsculpt
is nice minus the ears, but his color scheme is fairly bland and boring--
I REALLY wish FunPub had gone for a toy-accurate color scheme for this
guy, it would've looked much more interesting in both modes. I do give
them props for the "lightning bolt legs" on the sides of the tank mode,
though. Still, I feel this was a missed opportunity for the BotCon folks--
as I feel about this version of the Tripredacus Council in general, unfortunately.

       Ramhorn is as subtle as a variable voltage
harness to a data port. Stubbornness, violence and ignorance are among
his many "charms". While believing in the greater schemes of the Council,
Ramhorn bores easily and does not play the long game and derives enjoyment
from irritating others with his impatience.

       Ramhorn refuses to acknowledge his origins
so as a result many stories abound. Some say he was an early Cybertronian,
some say he was an Autobot, some say he killed an Autobot and stole his
name... One theory, which tends to keep the troops in line, is that he
clawed his way out of The Pit itself, being too ferocious to be contained,
dragging a number of ancient and wicked Sparks along with him. Many loyalists
believe this and many believe they were forged in the same fire as him,
making his troops incredibly loyal despite Ramhorn's brash and incredibly
blunt personality.
