    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Marvel TF Venom. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Marvel TF Venom

     Given Venom's visual
resemblance (somewhat) to Carnage, it was fairly inevitable that the black
symbiote would get repainted into the red one. And red is a bit more suiting
of a color for a sportscar like this one, with the black flame outlines
in vehicle mode looking quite fitting. (I wish they were more than just
outlines, though, and had some actual filler colors like orange or something.)
The black and silver/metallic gunmetal paint apps also go quite well with
the red, though the dark gray plastic in mech mode seems a little out-of-place.
Replacing it with black would have helped Carnage's contrast colors quite
a bit more, methinks. My main complaint about the color scheme has to do
with the shade of red, though-- it's a two shades TOO bright. A slightly
darker shade would really have made the color scheme seem less obviously
"toyish", not to mention I don't think "traditional" Carnage is quite this
light of a shade of red anyways. I also think it's a shame that the head
has been unchanged-- granted, Carnage shares many facial features with
Venom, but he's a considerably skinnier, guy than Venom (and I'm not exactly
a Spider-Man aficionado, here). Having that thick head mold doesn't work
quite as well, though I suppose I can still understand why they did it
this way.

     Contrary to what most
pictures of Carnage show, he actually DOES have a mold change, albeit a
subtle one-- the molded-in "VENOM" license plate has been changed to now
read "CARNAGE". It's not much, but worth noting. (It's also worth nothing
that it has no paint apps, unlike Venom's.)

     Marvel TF Carnage is
an easy pass for pretty much everyone except completists and really big
fans of the character that'll buy any plastic version of him. It's a fairly
poor mold in mech mode to start with, but although red fits a sportscar
a bit more, it's too light of a shade, the head mold doesn't fit Carnage
all that well, and although he has some nice contrast colors, he doesn't
look nearly as visually interesting as Marvel TF Venom.

       The evil of Carnage is matched only
by his thirst for power. By melding his alien symbiote with the war-suit
given to him by Doctor Doom, he can greatly enhance his already impressive
strength and achieve ultimate devastation. He can even disguise himself
as a muscle car, making him a formidable foe for the likes of Thor and
Iron Man.
