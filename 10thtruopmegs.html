       The colors on this remolded
version of Primal are much more subtle and less primary than on the original
version's. The gray used for the fur is a much more silvery, lighter gray
instead of the solid black used for the original Primal, which fits a silverback
gorilla better. The silver fists and robot feet also look really really
nice, and are more show-accurate to boot. The blues used for the robot
head and swords are also of a noticeably lighter shade than on the original
toy, and this is the sole color change I liked better on the original--
a darker blue just seems to suit Primal better, to me.

       As for the mold changes,
two parts have been changed for this new version. Firstly, the robot head
is not spot-on show-accurate Season 1 Primal, down to the smallest detail.
It's certainly better than the rounded Prime head/Mutant mask head we got
on the original. The gorilla face piece has also been remolded-- it does
look less "mean" and more emotive than the original's face, but honestly
it looks a bit too cartoony and just out of place with the more rigid,
less exaggerated surrounding parts. The other side of the face piece, which
forms the chestplate piece in robot mode, looks much better this time around
however, and looks EXACTLY like it does on the show, without all those
ugly hollow lines in it that the original had.

         Before their ships first clashed in
deep space, Optimus Primal had never even heard of Megatron. As his ship
crashed burning to the surface of a remote and distant world, Optimus Primal
thought only of preserving the lives of his crew, sparing not a thought
for the criminal he pursued, the evil robot mastermind that would become
his nemesis. It was only later, when he fought toe to toe with Megatron
and looked his enemy in the eye for the first time that he understood their
battle would become a war, and that he was all that stood between the Maximals
and total destruction.

          The most noticeable color
change the redone version of Megatron has is that the light purple of the
original has been exchanged for an lighter, almost lavender-esque shade.
The pale yellow underside spray paint apps have been exchanged for a much
more noticeable burnt orange, as well, and the purple used on Megatron's
robot mode parts is a lighter shade than on the original. All of those
three color changes I'm not too crazy about, but the robot mode has a TON
more paint apps than the original version had-- the chest, waist, and upper
legs are now covered in new paint apps, nearly all of them show-accurate.
His beast mode head also has pupils painted on it this time around as well,
instead of just being solid red.
         </font>
         <br/>
         <font face="OCR A Extended">
          As far as I can discern,
Megatron only has one remolding bit done, and that's to his robot head--
it's now much more show-accurate, and it doesn't have the silly Mutant
head bat-flaps on the sides of it. However, that said, the face molding
looks a little too "soft" to me in the lines, and thus a little too cartoony.
Quite frankly, going solely by looks and not by show accuracy, I probably
prefer the original head over this one.

            If it is true that a hero is defined
most clearly by the enemies he fights, then Optimus Primal is, perhaps
the greatest hero in the history of Cybertron, for certainly Megatron is
it's greatest villain. Through his career as a criminal mastermind began
with a simple theft, it was an object of such great significance that Megatron
hoped it could change the course of history. The struggle for the Golden
Disk became one of the great conflicts - a battle for supremacy known as
the Beast Wars!

            The Toys "R" Us Optimus
Primal vs. Megatron set is a nice show-accurate update to molds that definitely
had some issues in that area with their first releases. The updates are
certainly nice, and these molds were some of the best form the early Beast
Wars days. If you're a fan of the series and don't have the original toys,
you can't go wrong with 'em if you have $40 to spare. Mildly recommended.
