    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Spider-Man. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Spider-Man gets re-done
in his increasingly famous "black symbiote costume" look, which is considerably
more suitable for a motorcycle than the original Spider-Man TF's red-and-blue.
The spider emblems on the motorcycle windshield and the robot mode chest
also are extremely well-done. The accent colors of white, silver, and gray,
while not the best accent colors (Spider-Man here is decidedly monochrome),
still work reasonably well. Unfortunately, though this idea was interesting
enough in theory, in execution it's pretty flawed. The main reason is that
Spider-Man is almost ENTIRELY black. With the exception of his windshield
and his missiles, ALL of his parts are cast in black plastic, and the silver
and white paint applications are too far and few in between. What you end
up with is a pretty boring-looking toy that doesn't catch the toy nearly
as well as the original. I understand that they have to stay true to Spider-Man's
traditional black costume, but couldn't they at least have spiced up the
vehicle mode more?

     Black-costumed Spider-Man
was a good idea for a repaint, but he REALLY could've used more colors
than just, essentially, "black, black, and more black". He needs more interesting
accent colors to make him stand out, particularly in vehicle mode. Unless
you're a particularly huge fan of this costume over the "classic" red-and-blue,
I'd go for the original release of this toy first.

       Capable of phenomenal acceleration,
and maneuverable enough to weave through traffic as easily as Spider-Man
himself dodges bullets, his motorcycle mode is the ultimate extension of
his style. In mech mode, it duplicates his powers almost perfectly, with
powerful electromagnets that allow wall-crawling, and missile launchers
that fire explosive blasts of webbing strong enough to entangle even the
most powerful machine opponent.
