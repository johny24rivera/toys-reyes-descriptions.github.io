    Twinstrike is a direct
update of the G1 Terrorcon Sinnertwin in pretty much everything but name
("Sinnertwin" probably wouldn't make it past the copyright for a kids'
toy nowadays, anyways). In beast mode, Sinnertwinstrike is a two-headed,
four-legged, two-tailed dragon-- a rather unique beast mode, to be sure.
The proportions in this mode are great all around, with a lean stomach,
powerful hindlegs, and two fierce horned heads. The only proportional problem
I have here-- and it's a minor one-- is that the rear feet are a bit too
large. There's no robot mode extras whatsoever in this mode, always a good
thing. A LOT of ridges are molded onto the toy, particularly on the tails
and heads. There's a few mechanical spring and gear details on the legs,
but by-and-large this is a more ornamental, royal-looking aesthetic, as
is the case on most of the other Prime Predacons. Twinstrike's color scheme
pretty closely apes G1 Sinnertwin's, with a good mix of a dark teal-aquamarine
shade against a somewhat dull yellow (both of which are rather milky in
their shading, which in this case looks fairly nice to me). Unfortunately,
outside of the silver horns and red eyes in the heads, as well as the metallic-shaded
greenish blue on part of the front legs, there aren't many paint apps visible
in this mode, though the colors are broken up enough where it's not that
much of an issue. Twinstrike's articulation in this mode is at each neck,
at the front shoulders, at the back shoulders, at the base of the two tails
(as one piece), and at the rear ankles. Nearly all of these are ball joints,
providing Twinstrike about as good a range of motion as you could reasonably
ask for on Legion-class beastformer. Twinstrike's weapon is the standard
"big ol' hammer" weapon that a lot of Beast Hunters legion figures have,
and it can fit in a surprising number of areas on the toy-- on either side
of his back, in between his two tails, on peg holes on his upper and lower
rear legs, in between either of his mouths, or in ports on his front elbows.
This means that if you have the weapons, you can SERIOUSLY load Twinstrike
up!

    Twinstrike's transformation
is surprisingly complex for a Legion class toy (though it's still a far
cry from being complicated overall). Yes, he does the "stand me up and
flip my head" transformation, but his twin heads form his arms, while his
front legs go behind his back instead. There's also some more minor steps
involved with his legs, involving rotating his feet and his upper leg panels
onto his lower legs (the latter of which can be a bit overly stiff to slide
out and rotate). The end result strays a bit further from G1 Sinnertwin's
robot mode layout, but it's for the better-- the dragon heads make great
arms on a toy of this size, and all the little finangling with the legs
is worth it, resulting in a very well proportioned "core" for the robot.
His front beast legs do stick out pretty darn obviously on his back, though,
and are my chief complaint with the toy-- they don't lock in anywhere,
either, and when you're posing the front legs in beast mode they can slide
around a bit on their transformation joint, another minor annoyance. The
twin tails also are on Twinstrike's back, but they fold in pretty well
and the tips of the tails frame his head in a way that I think looks pretty
cool. Here the metallic violet bits on Twinstrike's chest and lower legs
become apparent, giving a much-needed accent color to this toy that looks
great and contrasts with both the yellow and blue. The mold detailing on
Twinstrike's head and chest is also incredibly well-done-- again, fitting
the ornamental, ridged style of the Prime Predacons, with an extra level
of mean-ness added to Twinstrike's head, which is has some nice red eyes
blaring against his silver face and bluish green "helmet". For articulation
in this mode, Twinstrike can move at the shoulders (at two points), hips,
and ankles. It's a bit more restricted than his beast mode, to be sure,
but as a Legion class figure it's more-or-less par for the course. Twinstrike
also gains yet another peg hole for a Cyberverse-scaled weapon in this
mode-- this time, in the middle of his chest.

    Twinstrike is one of
the best Legion-class designs to come out of the Beast Hunters line, with
an amazing beast mode, fantastic mold detailing, a transformation that
defies expections (in a good way) at a few places, and a robot mode that
has great proportions and looks great, albeit with a few kibble issues.
Highly recommended, regardless of whether you plan on getting the rest
of the legion "Terrorcons" or not.
