    Beast mode is a pteranodon...
sorta. It's actually a quezodactyl (or something like that), which is like
a pteranodon, only larger and without the head crest. Many people say it
actually looks a bit more like a pelican, and I'd have to agree, if it
weren't for the smooth, non-feather-detailed wings. This beast mode, although
nice visually, is rather oddly constructed. The wings are made up of several
parts only connected to each other at one joint, so in most positions,
the wings look like they're broken up. It would have been better if the
wings just consisted of one or two pieces each. The feet also bend rather
oddly- it's very hard to describe, you'll just have to look at the picture.
Skydive is also very hard to stand in this mode, because of his small feet
and the fact that most of his body weight is on one side. The body also
doesn't stay together that well, due to the fact that it, like the wings,
is made of several parts only connected at one place. Skydive has a "lunging"
action in this mode- if you press a tab on his lower neck, his head shoots
forward, opening and closing its mouth quickly. Rather nice, but it doesn't
always work as well as it should. On the other hand, this mode has a nice
"skeletal" look to it, which is cool considering that this is an extinct
animal. This is also one of the few Beast Machines Maximals that has a
technorganic look to it, whereas most of the other Maximals leaned toward
either being more mechanical (
    <a href="bmsnarl.html">
     Snarl
    </a>
    ) or more
organic (
    <a href="megacheetsbm.html">
     Cheetor
    </a>
    ). The silver "dusting"
on the wings is also a nice touch.

    Robot mode is, for the
most part, very good, and definitely a character. The jester-cap-style
head is absolutely begging for a backstory, as is the large gash on Skydive's
chest, which the tech specs mention nothing of. The transformation to getting
to this mode, however, is pretty confusing, but after a while, you start
to get the hang of it. His front chest piece in beast mode may pop off
a bit easily during transformation, however, so be careful. As I was saying
earlier, the robot mode definitely adds a lot of character to this toy-
it is also one of the few very skinny male Maximals. His body structure
is very original because of another thing- his legs start at the sides
of his midsection, not under it, so, although it looks a little odd, it's
certainly innovative. Skydive's stability, however, suffers again in this
mode, because of his small feet and long legs. His "slasher claws" on his
hands are placed... oddly, to say the least. It's hard to get him in a
pose in this mode without him looking like he's giving you the finger.
He has a weak "slashing" action in this mode,  where if you push the
transparent orange wing tab out of its locked position, the hand and claws
will pull back towards the wing. It's kind of weak, though, seeing as how
he only slashes BACKWARDS. Skydive's beast head also sticks out rather
ominously on his back in this mode; however, it doesn't get in the way.
The spark crystal is on his chest in this mode, you can't miss it.

    Overall, a very innovative
and interesting toy, although it does have its flaws. Still,  I recommend
this toy above most of the other regular Beast Machines Maximals.

      To the Vehicons, Skydive is the true
menace of the skies above Cybertron. Speed and maneuverability are unmatched
within the Maximal ranks; makes him an impossible target. Reinforced, specialized
alloys offer maximum protection if any Vehicons manage to get a lock. Wings
act as energy receptors, supplying incredible endurance - always outlasts
opponents. Despite stoic personality, Skydive takes great pleasure in "buzzing"
secret Maximal outposts.
