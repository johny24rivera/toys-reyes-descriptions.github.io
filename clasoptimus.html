    Optimus Prime's vehicle
mode is, of course, a truck cab. It's very realistic-looking (if you ignore
such obvious toy necessities and hinges and the like, of course), right
down to the transparent windows with seats visible in the inside. The style
of the truck cab is a bit less "square" than Optimus' traditional form,
but this new forms helps to modernize him a bit while still making it easily
recognizable as Optimus, what with the red, blue, and silver/gray color
scheme and all. The silver stripes on the sides and top of the cab help
to give the vehicle mode a bit more zazz than Prime's color scheme has
traditionally had, as well. The toy all fits together very solidly, and
there's no robot extras to speak of, with one exception-- it's rather obvious
that the robot feet are on the rear end of the cab, but they still blend
in with their surroundings somewhat well. Overall, a great vehicle mode,
to be sure. His allegiance rub symbol, in case you're wondering, is on
the right side of this mode.

    Prime's robot mode,
to put it simply, is one of the most amazing robot modes I've ever seen
on ANY Transformer. Practically everything about it is perfect. The only
downside I can really see to this mode is that parts of the truck sides
hang off the sides of the lower arms, but they don't get in the way of
articulation and considering the sheer awesomeness that is everything else,
it's EASILY forgiven. Prime's proportions are PERFECT, right down to a
switcharoo on the lower chest to make it look like the truck grill and
front bumper forms his chest and waist, even they don't (they tuck nicely
behind his back). As such, his chest looks considerably slimmer than it
otherwise would have, yet still makes him look fairly muscular and ready
to take on anyone. His great headsculpt-- very Prime-ish, but with a fiercer
expression-- only adds to this impression. His legs are nice and long,
but without being too long or beefy, and Prime is EXTREMELY articulated--
he can move at pretty much anywhere you can reasonably desire except the
wrists. Heck, he can rotate at TWO different spots at the waist. Given
that he's not back- or top-heavy at all, this means you can get him into
some fantastic poses. Plus, he comes with not one, but TWO guns-- one double-barreled
rifle made out of his smokestacks and a larger gun made out of the roof
of his vehicle mode. Both can also be held in a configuration behind his
upper back, in case you want his hands to be free.

    Practically flawless
with great proportions, articulation, and some nice weaponry, it's hard
not to highly recommend this toy to even the most casual Transfan. GET
IT NOW.

      The greatest in a long line of Autobot
leaders, Optimus Prime is a beacon of hope to those who suffer under the
tyranny of Megatron. He is devoted to the defense of weaker creatures,
and has dedicated his life to fighting against Megatron wherever he goes.
He is unwavering in his compassion, which sometimes allows his enemies
to take advantage of him, but he is also utterly without fear in the face
of overwhelming odds. Where freedom is threatened, he is an unstoppable
force, and a mighty defender of justice and right.
