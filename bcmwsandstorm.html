     Sandstorm here is-- as
the theme of BotCon 2013 implies-- an homage to the Machine Wars Sandstorm
toy, which was similar to G1 Sandstorm in having one of his modes be a
helicopter but little else. The base colors of a rather dark (but flat)
military green, black, and metallic bronze/brown are a very appropriate
color scheme for a military helicopter, and it also looks DARN cool. Sandstorm
is one of the toys that only could have been some kind of exclusive, given
how MANY paint apps there are on this guy-- mostly in the form of an extremely
well-done set of black tiger stripes across nearly the entire figure. All
that black and green mixing together does quite well, and the metallic
bronze on the front of the wings, the gun of the Mechtech weapon, and part
of the side thrusters makes for a great contrast color. The brown plastic
on areas like the face, feet, and little ridges on the side of the helicopter
mode doesn't look quite as nice, but as far as a plastic color I think
it's as close as you're going to get to bronze without using paint, and
it still looks pretty good with the green. The cockpit is a nice transparent
blue (along with the visor on his robot head), though there's also some
light pale blue to give Sandstorm a main "light" color. This blue is most
obviously seen on his rotors, but also on his side thrusters and a few
other minor parts, such as on his Mechtech weapon. That said, I do think
the light blue rotor is a bit much in terms of the amount of the color,
but to be fair it was like this on the original MW Sandstorm toy. Sandstorm
also has a couple other decals that hearken back to the original MW toy,
like the "MP black-on-white" font above the cockpit, as well as the military
white-star-against-a-blue-circle-and-a-white-line emblem on the wings.

     Sandstorm has no mold
changes when compared to Skyhammer-- for the most part this is okay, but
the headsculpt looks a bit too "movie-ish" to pass for something that's
supposed to be a more traditionally-sculpted visored face-- there's too
many details. Otherwise, the mold fits MW Sandstorm pretty well as-is.

     BotCon 2013 Sandstorm
is a stellar mold in an excellent color scheme, with only a few very minor
complaints (the completely blue rotors, the unchanged facesculpt) on what
is a very well-done toy. The number of paint apps on Sandstorm is exceptional,
and it fits the MW version of the character pretty well, for the most part.
When it comes to the combination of the overall color scheme and mold (that
is, not taking into account ingenuity or my like of the character), Sandstorm
is my favorite use of this mold and my 2nd-favorite exclusive from BotCon
2013, with
     <a href="bcmwmirage.html">

     just barely beating him
out for the top spot. Highly recommended, especially since he was in low
demand to the point where it's not even hard to find him for below mass-market
retail price!

       After Autobot Electrons came to Cybertron
speaking of an impending war, Sandstorm adopted a new battle copter configuration.
The choice puzzled those close to him-- for a supposed pacifist, Sandstorm's
new form seemed far too aggressive for his personality. However, it wasn't
the laser cannons that attracted Sandstorm to this particular upgrade,
it was the speed. His new alternate mode is equipped with twin turbine
engines that allow Sandstorm to streak across the deserted wastelands on
the other side of Cybertron like a turbo-charged fireball!

       Now drafted among the ranks of Strika
and Obsidian's defense of Cybertron and covered in weapons and armor plating,
Sandstorm faces a choice he has never had to make before. Fight or be destroyed.
And surprising himself most of all, there is something deep inside of his
robotic brain telling him that he might actually enjoy fighting...
