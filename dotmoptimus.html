    For the third movie,
Optimus gets a third crack at a voyager-class version of his movieverse
self. In vehicle mode, he's a truck cab-- same as he's been since TF1,
so no changes there. The proportions in this mode are generally pretty
good, though his fuel tanks on the sides are oddly and noticeably inflated,
for some reason. There are a few robot mode extras visible in this mode--
most of them from the rear half, where there's some noticeable gaps in
the middle of the truck bed and a hollow back end to the cab. You can also
see his feet underneath the fuel tanks if you look at him from a straight-on
side angle, but that's a minor quibble at best. Optimus Prime's mold detailing
is generally pretty good-- you can even see the little "rivets" on the
side of this mode, as well as on the front grille and a neat pattern on
his roof-- but Prime's paint detailing is rather lacking here, particularly
when it comes ot the number of flame paint apps he HAS versus how many
he SHOULD have to be movie-accurate. A few on the sides of the cab nose
and the front of the rear wheel covers just don't cut it. What's even weirder
are the solar panel-like transparent bits on the top of his cab nose and
roof-- granted, they look kinda neat, but they're completely inaccurate
to the movie for no logical reason that I can see, considering flames should
be there instead. Another side note here is that the top halves of Prime's
smokestacks are completely seperate pieces than the bottom halves.Â 
They don't slide or lock into place, and thus they tend to be slightly
askew-- a bit of a sticking point for an OCD guy like me. As for Prime's
Mechtech weapon, it's neat in terms of how many parts fold around each
other, but honestly it's all a bit pointless-- by pushing in on the back
trigger, it can change from a gun to... a slightly different type of gun
with solar panels. (Again, what's with the solar panels?) Like with all
Mechtech weapons, it unfortunately can't stay in its "activated" configuration.
There are five different Mechtech ports on Prime's vehicle mode-- two on
each side and one near the end of the truck bed, the latter perfectly sized
for the weapon he comes with, which helps to hide many of those hollow
gaps in the back end of said vehicle mode when it's plugged in. Given all
the other Mechtech ports, though, you could seriously arm up Prime in this
mode if you so desired.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is a bit simpler to transform than his previous voyager class attempts
(though still not exactly easy), and unfortunately he suffers a bit for
it. First, the positives-- his mold detailing is excellent, particularly
on his "fake kibble" chest where you've got a nice paint wash. His head
also looks great, but it appears that almost all of his paint budget was
blown on those pieces-- his legs are lacking some important paint apps,
like the fake wheels molded into his upper thighs (if you're gonna mold
in fake kibble, I think you should at least
    <i>
     paint
    </i>
    it if it's not
the correct color already...). The big fuel tanks on his back are a bit
inaccurate to his movie model (and, again, way too big), but the way they're
positioned they look a bit like a jetpack, so I honestly don't mind them
much. What I DO mind are Prime's arms-- simply put, they're awful. They're
full of unsightly kibble-- like his front wheels and the panels on the
back of his hands-- that also hinder movement quite a bit, particularly
at the elbows. They're also a little too short, and his chest way too small
to boot. This is a side effect of roughly two-thirds of his mass going
into his legs-- granted, Movie Prime's design is a bit "leggy", but certainly
not to THIS extent. That said, taken by themselves the legs look pretty
good and quite movie-accurate. As far as articulation, this version of
Optimus can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two
points), wrists, waist, hips (at three points), knees, and ankles (at two
points-- yes, he has ankle tilts). Now, this may seem like a lot, and in
the legs, it certainly is-- however, keep in mind my earlier comments about
all the kibble on his arms and how much it restricts their movement-- they
really can't move as much as you'd think. (To make matters worse, his shoulders
ratcheting joints aren't strong enough for him to point his Mechtech weapon
forward.)

    While I appreciate the
effort to make a voyager class Optimus that's slightly easier to transform,
the DotM voyager is definitely the worst of the three attempts so far at
this size class. The vehicle mode is generally good-- odd "solar panels"
and some gaps in the back end aside-- but the robot mode is really misproportioned,
with huge legs and an undersized chest and arms, in addition to having
some kibble problems on the upper body. He's not outright BAD, but the
other voyager-class incarnations of Movie Prime are both quite good, making
this version pale in comparison.
