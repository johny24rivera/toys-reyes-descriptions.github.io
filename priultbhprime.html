    Optimus Prime's big ol'
monster truck mode is certainly a monster for this toy, one of the annual
Optimus Prime and/or Bumblebee "big toys". There are parts of this mode
that look awesome-- I love the long armored spikes on the front bumper,
the transparent green windows with some circuitry lines on them and the
nice metallic green windows on the sides, the big and bulky tires, and
the "Firebreath Cyclocannons" on the top (which I'll get to in more detail
shortly. However, beyond those bits, this is a VERY weak mode, and definitely
was third tier in terms of design priority to his robot mode and his gimmicks.
There are HUGE, incredibly noticeable gaps in between the front windows
and the lower section of his front, only bridged by part of his front bumper.
It's also incredibly obvious that the body of his truck mode is just his
robot legs and arms on top of each other-- there really isn't even an attempt
to make the back part look more square and truck-like. The large gap in
between the parts extends to the sides of this mode, which are downright
awful if you don't mostly cover them up with Optimus' sword and shield
pieces. There's another gap in between the front third and rear two-third
sections of this mode, where the upper robot legs are very blatant. The
back bumper is also non-existent, simply being Prime's robot feet. As for
the color scheme, for the most part it's pretty much Prime's traditional
scheme-- gray, red, and dark blue. No major surprises here, though the
shade of red is a bit lighter than normal (I would have preferred a bit
of a darker shade, myself). There's also a lot of that light milky gray
that I just find a rather blah turn-off in terms of colors for me and that
should have been semi-metallic (i.e., "glittery") in its shading to make
it look more interesting. The addition of green windows and some green
projectiles does help to give Optimus at least a new color in terms of
accents, however, and the gunmetal gray used for the Cyclocannons is pretty
neat. Speaking of the Cyclocannons, they are definitely the highlight of
this toy. In this mode, the idea is to start with one of the five different
dragon heads (all incredibly well-detailed in terms of the mold, by the
way) facing forward. Press down on the trigger on the handle on top of
the Cyclocannon to fire a spring-loaded missile from the dragon "mouth".
You then turn the handle to the right, which automatically brings forward
the next dragon head as you the handle springs back to its normal position
which lets you do the same thing all over again. This means you can fire
all five dragon head-cannons in quick succession, a VERY neat and addicting
gimmick. Even cooler? The heads automatically look forward from behind
Prime's back in robot mode, meaning one head will "pop up" at a time from
behind Prime's back and shoot, with the auto-rotation gimmick still in
check. The missiles can fire surprisingly far, as well. As for the paint
detailing, Optimus is a bit sparse in some places, particularly the sides
of this mode. His cyclocannons and milky gray parts particularly could
have used some more paint-- his huge weapons

    Optimus' robot mode
is much better than his vehicle mode, and his transformation is very simple,
mostly consisting of just rotating his legs/waist and arms around to the
front and them flipping up his head and repositioning his cannons. That
said, the way the front two wheels fold up inside the cavities of his lower
legs was a nice extra touch. Here Optimus Prime keeps his beefed-up proportions
for his Beast Hunters form intact quite well, with everything quite wide
and curvy in terms of his appendages. The only exception to this is his
head, which is almost laughably small proportionally. I know Optimus Prime
is hulked out, but that doesn't make him a pinhead! The head itself is
sculpted and painted quite well, with Optimus' mouth in full view, his
faceplate "retracted" on this version of him. He also has an oddly congenial
look on his face for such a heavily armored 'bot, which is a tad odd. Prime
has no vehicle mode extras in this mode at all (which he'd better not have
after such an atrocious vehicle mode), so no issues there. Thankfully his
paint detailing is a bit more prevalent in this mode, with his lower arms,
legs, and waist in particular having a good mix of silver and gunmetal
paint. His upper arms could've used a paint app or two, though. The mold
detailing is quite striking on his more detailed bits-- I've already talked
about the Cyclocannons, but the angled paint and designs on his feet, kneecaps,
chest, and shoulders really looks very nice and very in tune with the Prime
aesthetic while making it all more "extreme". Optimus comes with two incredibly
evil-looking accessories-- a huge ornamental butcher-like knife and a shield
that has a very demonic-looking dragon face design on it. Honestly, given
the target audience I think these weapons are a bit TOO "edgy" and should
have been toned down slightly, but I do have to admit Optimus looks good
wielding them. Optimus' Cyclocannons still work in this mode as I explained
earlier, but what's even cooler in this mode is that you don't have to
do the handle action youself if you don't want to-- simply push down on
the spiked fender piece on his stomach and the Cyclocannon will automatically
rotate one slot, all while Optimus' eyes and chest light up a light green!
(You still have to push the trigger behind his back to fire each missile,
however.) For articulation, Optimus can move at the neck (slightly), shoulders
(at four points, with one of those being his shoulder "flaps"), elbows.
hips, (at two points), and knees (at two points). He also can technically
rotate at the waist, but this is for the transformation and is considerably
off-center, so anything more than a click either direction and it looks
very odd. He really could've used ankle and wrist movement, but otherwise
he's pretty good in this respect.

    Beast Hunters "Ultimate"
Optimus Prime looks great in robot mode (pinhead aside) and has an absolutely
amazing, addictive "Firebreath Cyclocannon" gimmick. That said, given his
rather expensive price and the fact that his vehicle mode is so bad it's
just embarrassing, unless the Cyclocannon gimmick is really worth that
much to you, if you're only to get one version of this design you're much
better off picking up the

       With Ultra Magnus the latest casualty
of the Predacon assault, Optimus Prime decides that enough is enough. Whether
the new weaponry discovered by Bumblebee is ready or not, the Predacons
must be stopped. Donning the heavy Firebreath Cyclocannons, Optimus Prime
steps outside into the hot desert air, determined to find Predaking and
bring him down one way or another. He doesn't have far to look. The Predacon
leader has come looking for him, armed to the teeth and ready to destroy
every last Autobot. That's when Optimus Prime receives a transmission from
Autobot Ratchet. "Sir," says the scientist, "I've figured out how to activate
our new weaponry. Sending the information to you now." Within moments,
the Autobot leader feels power flowing through him, and he knows even before
it begins that the fight against Predaking can only end in victory.
