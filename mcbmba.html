    Beast mode is a technorganic
spider. This mode might have looked nice, if the legs weren't positioned
every which way. There's no possible way to get all the spider legs to
touch the floor or even look like they're all touching the floor. Pretty
bad planning, there. Also, from a back view, Blackarachnia's robot head
and waist clearly show- the spider abdomen doesn't cover it up at all.
On the other hand, the detailing is quite good on this toy, especially
for a Happy Meal toy. The spider face looks pretty cool as well.

    In robot mode, Blackarachnia
is actually quite show-accurate. Her bulb on her rear is a bit too large
proportionally, however, as are her back spider legs. Her main body trunk
is pretty nice, though, and well-detailed, both mold- and paint-wise. My
main problem with this mode is that she looks a little... chunky... in
this mode, and Blackarachnia is anything BUT chunky on the show.

    A so-so toy in robot
mode, but a really bad beast mode. Only recommended for completists.
