    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Terri-Bull.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titans Return Terri-Bull

     The Titan Master Skytread's
robot mode is kept entirely the same (in terms of details) when compared
to Terri-Bull, with no mold changes-- however, the Titan Master's head
mode facesculpt has been changed to G1 Flywheels'. (Flywheels is now apparently
called Skytread because of copyright reasons.) Anyways, the arms give Skytread
really obvious side antennae that are definitely not on the original toy,
but other than that it's a solid headsculpt, re-doing Flywheels' headsculpt
with more modern proportions. He's got a circular forehead, vents on the
sides of his cheeks, a center crest on his forehead, and a few minor "circuitry-like"
details. He's also got a dull red visor and a silver face. Other than the
face, though, there's no paint apps on the entire Titan Master, which is
unfortunate, particularly in robot mode. As for the color scheme of the
whole set itself, it again follows G1 Flywheels' general color scheme with
a muddy "moderate" brown and fuchsia being the main colors. It's a rather
unique color scheme, with both colors being rather "medium" in shade but
still contrasting against each other fairly well. There's also just a touch
of darker brown paint on the windows of the cockpit in jet mode, which
looks okay but isn't really different enough from the brown plastic to
really add much to the color scheme-- I wish another color or two had been
added as accents on the accessory. That said, I do like the color breakup
particularly in jet mode, as there's quite a lot of fuchsia paint on the
toy-- on the nosecone, the wings, the revealed details on the body when
you flip out the wings, and on the missiles on the sides. When the brown
is broken up that much-- even if the other colors besides fuchsia aren't
used-- he still looks fairly visually interesting.

     The Titans Return Skytread
set fits the former Duocon a lot better than Terri-Bull, given that the
original Flywheels became both a jet and a tank. The main colors look pretty
good, though I wish there was a bit more color variety on the accessory
and at least
     <i>
      some
     </i>
     paint on the Titan Master's robot mode. Still,
overall I think the color scheme is quite unique and a slight improvement
over Terri-Bull's, even though it's a bit incomplete as far as an actual
"update" of the character.
