    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the RotF deluxe class Sideways
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the RotF deluxe

      THAT
Dead End
     </a>
     , THIS Dead End! Odd how two toys that were obviously supposed
to be completely different characters and released in the same line within
a few waves of each other got the same name. Regardless, THIS Dead End
is the one more deserving of the name, as he's definitely an homage to
G1 Dead End, as can be gleaned most obviously from his bio. However, although
it may not be obvious from a cursory glance, his color scheme is also an
homage to his G1 Stunticon self-- it's just reversed. Whereas his G1 counterpart
had a primarily reddish-brown car mode with some black more visible in
robot mode, this one has a mostly red car mode with some reddish-brown
and tan visible in robot mode. It's a great color scheme, so I'm glad to
see it used again, and switching around the amounts of black and reddish-brown
was a nice touch, as I think it makes the car mode look really slick, in
particular. The reddish-brown is a good shade too, and it, along with the
tan, make nice contrasts to the black. My favorite bits about the color
scheme have to do with the transparent purple used for the windows-- which
really make Dead End look even more "dark" and also have the added benefit
of making his robot parts inside said windows harder to see in vehicle
mode-- and the light red accents. It's a really nice shade of red, and
really goes well against the black, particularly in vehicle mode, where
they take Dead End from being "just another black sportscar" and adding
some nice contrast stripes to really make him pop.

     Dead End has no mold
changes, except for a new head-- and honestly, I'm not all that fond of
it. It's rather awkward-looking, with the big "goggles" and "gas mask",
and doesn't look very menacing. On the plus side though, I do like the
further homage to G1 Dead End with the asymettrical black stripe painted
on one side of his reddish-brown forehead-- this was exactly how G1 Dead
End's general color scheme was in car mode.

     RotF Dead End-- the
deluxe, anyway-- is a great repaint. All of his colors strike all the right
notes for me and contrast excellently with each other, being both fitting
for a Decepticon, fairly unique, and a homage to but not direct replica
of his G1 paint job. I'm not a big fan of his new head mold, but that aside,
if you're going to get one version of this (admittedly mediocre) mold,
I'd definitely recommend this one.

       Creepy, dark, and depressed, Dead End
has few friends, even among the Decepticons. He usually hangs out in the
darkest corner of the room, where his eyes can glow to their greatest effect.
He never speaks, unless it's to say something gloomy. The other Decepticons
avoid him, which suits him just fine. The only time they're useful to him
is when they're recharging, and he can sneak up on them to drain energy.
