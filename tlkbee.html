    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the deluxe AoE Concept
Camaro Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Redecoing the Age of
Extinction Bumblebee toy is especially non-sensical for the Premier Edition
line, as these are supposedly aimed at the older "more discerning" collector
who's more likely to, y'know, realize this is a DIFFERENT DESIGN. Especially
when it's the most different design of all the Movie Bumblebee designs
up to this point! Re-using a different Camaro with a very different look
in robot mode compared to TLK Bumblebee's-- which is much closer to TF1-3
'Bee-- doesn't work. That said, just taking this toy by itself, it has
a lot of the color changes that the other various TLK 'Bee toys do. The
main yellow is still of a "cheesy" semi-orangish shade, but it's definitely
closer to the yellow end of the spectrum this time around. The clear plastic
is now just a tinted shade, as opposed to the light blue on the AoE version,
removing a bit of color from the toy. TLK Bumblebee still has black, but
it's MUCH sparser on this toy-- used on his wheels, ninja-star things,
and painted on his front grill, front hood (and roof if you bought anything
beyond the first batch), rear part of the side windows, rims, and the rear
spoiler and license plate. This may still seem like a lot, but compared
to AoE Bumblebee in robot mode in particular, the legs are just completely
robbed of paint. There's also a bit of dark brownish gray plastic on some
of the smaller interior connector pieces on the ankles, shoulders, and
hips, but it's not a major color-- he's still mostly yellow and black.
There is a decent amount of paint on the robot chest-- some dark metallic
gunmetal gray on the abs, silver on the crotch and sides of the stomach,
and some black on the pecs-- trying to highlight the details that are similar
to the other non-AoE movie Bumblebee designs. The robot head is also coated
in silver paint, with some yellow on the helmet (though not enough to be
accurate) and metallic silver blue on the robot eyes. There's also some
light metallic blue on the headlights, but not enough to really give 'Bee
another major color beyond the yellow and black.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee.

     The initial "hurried
redeco" of TLK Bumblebee I can't honestly recommend if you actually want
TLK Bumblebee, since it's a different model. If you couldn't get a deluxe
version of Concept Camaro AoE Bumblebee for a reasonable price, this makes
for a nice consolation prize (even if the paint job is inferior), but otherwise
skip this and get the more accurate, new mold released later.

      *After the first initial release, subsequent releases of this mold were
"fixed" with a more accurate black paint app added to the roof. If you
have a choice obviously go for the later, more painted version, all other
things being equal.
