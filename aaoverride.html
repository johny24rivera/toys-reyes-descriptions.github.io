    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to RotF Legends Sideways.

     Override is a fair rarity
among Transformers redecos nowadays-- it's a repaint that both isn't A.
a same-character redeco and/or B. an homage to a previous character. Nope,
Override here pretty much stands on his (her?) own. The dark blue-and-black
color scheme would be pretty boring by itself-- though the shade of dark
blue is a particuarly nice one. However, the metallic yellowish green stripes
in vehicle mode (and paint on the upper legs of the robot mode) really
help to add some color contrast and decoration in there, along with the
silver on the windows, grill, and face, and the pale gold on the headlights.
There's also some darker gunmetal gray used for some mold detailing near
the rear of the vehicle, but they're dark enough where they don't stand
out quite enough from the dark blue for my liking. All this said, I do
wish Override had a bit more spread-out paint detailing-- perhaps some
more paint apps on the arms in robot mode, which have plenty of mold detailing
that needs highlighting. Override's taillights are also sadly unpainted,
as well. The toy has "enough" paint, but it's almost all centered on the
vehicle front/chest and windows.

     Autobot Alliance Override
is a pretty nice redeco of the RotF Sideways mold, though a few more of
those yellowish-green paint apps (particularly on the arms) would have
really made it pop. Still, it's definitely the best paint job I've seen
this mold get.
