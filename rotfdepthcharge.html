    Depthcharge's vehicle
mode is a stealth boat, and is pretty darned solid all around. Although
the rear is hollow on the bottom, other than that there's no robot extras
whatsoever in this mode, and the proportions are
    <i>
     par excellence
    </i>
    .
What's particularly impressive is the sheer amount of mold detailing on
this figure-- he's got ALL the appropriate details for a stealth boat,
which is great considering his small size. Panels, guns, a communications
tower... it's all there. And although I think the blue-and-whitish-blue
camo scheme in this mode is pretty good, I wish a few more paint apps had
been spared to highlight some of these excellent details.

    Depthcharge's robot
mode is also quite impressive. His proportions are great for the most part,
fitting the movie aesthetic quite well with some fantastic little mold
details on his limbs and chest. (His head also has some great detailing,
but it looks VERY evil-- not very fitting for an Autobot.) The sole exception
to this are his lower legs, which are a bit absurdly large, with the front
of the boat mode poking up pretty far from where his knees are. The added
black and a bit of tan/gold help to break up the blue a bit and give him
a pretty good color scheme. His articulation is also superb-- he can move
at the neck, shoulders (at four points, including a point at the base of
his missile launchers), elbows (at two points), thumbs (yes, thumbs-- ON
A SCOUT TOY), waist, hips (at two points), and knees. There's nothing to
really get in the way except the boat points above his knees, so you get
him in some awesome poses. (In addition, Depthcharge has a third "attack"
mode where you combine his legs together so he can "sail" on them, but
it's really goofy-looking and really fan mode-y.)

    Depthcharge may have
some funky lower legs, but other than that he's an incredible scout design
and one of my favorites from the Revenge of the Fallen toyline. I like
Sonar's color scheme slightly better, but you owe it to yourself to pick
up at least ONE version of this mold, as it's fantastic, posable, great-looking,
and fun and simple to transform.

    <i>
     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Depthcharge is a shrewd military strategist.
Autobots and Decepticons alike are accustomed to ground and air-based combat,
but ocean tactics are unfamiliar to them. Depthcharge uses this to his
advantage, choosing a stealth boat mode to spy on Decepticon forces from
the nearest port. Fast and smart, Depthcharge never shies away from battle--
but he prefers to be armed with the element of surprise.
