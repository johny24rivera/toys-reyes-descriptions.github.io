    Bumblebee's sportscar
vehicle mode-- at least in terms of its general proportions-- is spot-on
when compared with the show model, with a nice angular design with small
fins on the rear sides, a relatively low roof, and is just a fairly unique
car. The mold colors are your usual yellow and black-- nothing special
here, your typical Bumblebee colors. Beyond the black windows, there's
some nice angular details on the sides that help break up the yellow, as
well as some black paint apps around the three "vent"-like details on the
front hood. They're not the full-fledged stripes like on the show model,
but given the transformation of the front section using black around the
front might've scratched the paint, so I understand the lack of paint there.
The blue and red headlights look quite nice, and they're a bit darker than
normal for headlight shades, so they contrast against the yellow a bit
better. That said, the lack of any paint on the taillights or rear window
is a bit of a bummer. Additionally, the way the front hood connects with
the main body of the car mode-- i.e., where the legs slide out and separate--
it doesn't all quite click in. There's just a bit of a gap there, like
there's one little notch that it just can't slide over to make the vehicle
mode nice and clean. It's not a major issue, but it is rather visually
annoying in this mode. On the back end the back of the robot head is pretty
obvious, with no real back of the vehicle beyond the taillights.

    Bumblebee's transformation
is simple yet intuitive, with a few swift motions being all that are needed--
slide the front section out, rotate it around at the waist, and then plug
it back in, which causes the shoulders and head to pop out. Especially
for such a simple transformation, this is a pretty solid robot mode, with
pretty solid proportions (though the shoulders could stand to pop out just
a BIT more from the sides of the body). For some reason, Bumblebee's head
doesn't fold up enough to look straight forward-- he looks downwards just
a little bit. If this really bugs you and you don't mind fiddling with
the toy a little bit, unscrew the screws on the sides of the waist juuuust
a bit, to the point where you can pop the tab on the bottom of the neck
up above the chest, then screw the screws back in. (Do NOT unscrew those
screws all the way, or you'll mess up some of the springs 'n parts that
help keep the transformation automatic). This means that the head won't
flip down in vehicle mode, but that's basically a useless motion anyways--
the head is still obvious from a back view anyways, and it's not otherwise
obvious in vehicle mode. The color breakup is a bit better in this mode,
with the black plastic and paint scattered around the yellow a bit more,
with a black waist, middle arms, and black paint on the chest and shoulders
(though some black is missing from further down on the chest). There's
also some silver paint on the abs and face, some nice blue on the eyes,
and a black vent on the forehead. There's some light gray plastic used
for the upper legs and the extending rod section for the transformation,
but thankfully there's a bit of a metallic tinge to it, so it doesn't look
boring like most light milky grays. The angular car molding on the chest
is quite well-done in particular, and the RID2015-usual "divots" on places
like the upper legs help add a bit more visual interest to the otherwise
fairly simple design as well. As far as articulation, Bumblebee can move
forwards a bit at the elbows, but that's it. A bit disappointing even for
a 3-step changer, honestly, but again, articulation isn't the point of
these simplified Transformers.

    Bumblebee is one of
the best 3-step RID2015 molds, looking pretty good in both modes and with
a very satisfying yet simple transformation. He's got some minor QC issues
in both modes, though (the head not looking straightforward in robot mode
and the slight gap in vehicle mode), and his articulation is a little too
limited even by simplified Transformer standards. Still, for a young 'un
who wants a decent-sized Bumblebee toy that you're confident they won't
break and is in show-accurate colors, this is a solid choice. (Though if
you don't care about show-inaccurate colors, there's a bunch of better-colored
redecoes of this mold as well.)
