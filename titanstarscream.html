    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War Within

     Starscream's actually
a repaint of Thundercracker, instead of visa versa! Whoda thunk? Anyways,
the first 6" Titanium repaint has your typical Starscreamy colors of red,
blue, and light gray, but the shade of gray used for this Starscream is
considerably lighter than the milky gray that's been traditionally used--
it's nearly white, in fact. And this is a BIG improvement to Starscream's
usually somewhat dull colors-- it greatly increases the contrast between
the colors and leaves Starscream looking much more dynamic than he's been
in the past, especially with the myriad paint apps he has all over. (What's
pretty cool is the way the sticker designs on the knees of the old G1 seekers
are partially replicated here on this toy's knees.) The red and blue used
are especially good-looking shades, which helps even more. The black, silver,
and yellowish orange also make great acccent colors, especially against
the dark blue. He unfortunately still has that grey head instead of a black
one like he's had in all his other previous incarnations, though-- not
sure what's up with that.

     War Within Starscream
is a great repaint of a fantastic mold, and managed to forgo the traditional
dullness of the "Starscreamy colors" by making the gray substantially lighter
and enhancing the color contrast. Recommended over War Within Thundercracker.

       One of the first warriors recruited
to the Decepticon cause, Starscream is a vicious warrior, and a gleeful
killer. Most Decepticons keep score of how many Autobots they take out,
but Starscream carves himself little trophies out of their pelvic gimbals.
As leader of the elite Seeker squadron assigned by Megatron to launch high-speed,
surprise assaults on Autobot strongholds, and one of the old guard among
the Decepticon leadership, he enjoys more freedom of opinion than many
other Decepticons. Megatron is tolerant of his sarcasm and belligerent
ambition only because Starscream is simply too efficient an engine of destruction
to do without.

       It is not only his skill as a fighter
that gives his Autobot victims pause. Before the war, he was an explorer
and scientist, with many friends among the Autobots - Jetfire and Grimlock
among them. Even then he was a bully and a manipulator, but few who knew
him suspected he could be capable of the atrocities now attributed to him.
