    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Red
Alert. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron
Red Alert

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Having Red Alert done
up as G1 Perceptor is pretty creative, and rather unexpected-- the homage
to Perceptor was most likely done because of the large cannon over the
shoulder in robot mode, which is similar to G1 Perceptor's telescope-cannon.
The colors are spot-on Perceptor, with pretty much all the colors exactly
like they were on the G1 toy. The red and pale blue go particularly well
together, and the black wheels and gun serve as a nice dark color to contrast
against the others. The silver chest and yellow visor in robot mode also
go well with the other colors and help to give the robot mode a bit more
individuality color-wise than it otherwise would have. However, Perceptor's
main problem (besides the horrible mold, discussed in the LoC Red Alert
review linked above) is that his vehicle mode really needs more paint apps.
Really, on the bare minimum of paint is used on his vehicle mode-- he really
needs something more to break up all that red, and using another paint
app or two on the all-black cannon would've helped as well.

     Classics Perceptor is
a decent repaint and a nice, creative homage to the G1 character. However,
its plainness in vehicle mode and the fact that it's definitely one of
the worst TF molds released recently makes it really hard to recommend
to anyone but the most diehard completist.
