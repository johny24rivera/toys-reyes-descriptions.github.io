    Optimus Prime's alternate
mode is a meteor-like "entry mode", seen for a brief period of time in
the movie as he crash-landed on Earth. It's a very original idea. The execution
on some of the details, though, seems a bit TOO coincidental, what with
the wheel-like stubs on the lower sides of this mode along with the front
bumper-like detailing on the front and the slanted windows. Besides, that,
however, this mode looks really cool, even if it's not the most playable
alt mode ever. The mold detailing is extraordinary, with every square inch
of the toy covered in it. The colors are very basic, but very realistic
for a meteor-like alt mode. It also fits with the movie toys' color schemes
anyways, since they aren't about catching the eye with bright colors but
instead looking realistic. The robot parts are covered up remarkably well,
with many different little panels covering up pretty much anything that
might be exposed in this mode. The only exception to this is the robot
feet, which are pretty obvious on the back end of the vehicle. The flame
piece that connects to the rear part of this mode is a nice touch, and
makes the entry mode look "speedier" and more sleek than it otherwise would
have been without that extra flame piece.

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is one of the more organic-looking designs in the Transformers movie
toyline, due to the fact that a lot of the silver-painted detailing looks
a lot like muscle fiber. The overall look is very great, and definitely
makes Optimus Prime look "unfinished," almost like he's naked without his
truck parts on. He's got a TONS of mold detailing all over the place in
this mode, even more so than in his entry mode-- really, this is one of
the most detailed Transformers I've ever seen, he looks great. His proportions
are also spot-on, while being a tad skinnier than normal emphasize the
"unfinished" look that the protoforms have going for them. His face looks
somewhat like his truck-alt-mode movie design, but a bit more bird-like
and without the coloration of said truck mode-- it looks quite alien, and
very cool. Prime also has excellent articulation-- he can move at every
single major point, including waist, wrist, and ankle articulation. You
can get ton of poses out of him, though his hip joints are a tad loose.
Optimus also comes with a gun, though the "firing" transparent orange plastic
gun that fits in the gun's hole can't fire at all, it just sticks in its
assigned hole, which is kinda lame. The only real problem I have with this
mode, however, is that Optimus' back entry mode kibble just kinda hangs
off without pegging into anything else or complementing the look of the
mode-- there must have been someway to incorporate all that into the mode
better, though it doesn't restrict movement all that much, at least.

    Protoform Optimus Prime
is a pretty good toy, especially in robot mode where he has stellar proportions,
detailing, and articulation. The entry mode may not be very playable and
the fake "tires" are rather lame, but it's a cool idea for a Transformer
nonetheless. I like

     Protoform Starscream

    a tad better (mainly because he has less kibble in robot mode), but I'd
still recommend this toy as well-- it's not only original, but cool-looking
as well.

      Summoned by a signal from one of his
bravest warriors, Optimus Prime thunders down through the space above Earth
and races into battle, his protoform body tracing a fiery path across the
sky. Most powerful among the Autobots, he is dedicated to the recovery
of the AllSpark, and the protection of both the humans on Earth and his
own people back on Cybertron. Scanning an Earth truck, he morphs into a
form that will allow him to hide until the time comes to enter battle against
Megatron!
