    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Stormcloud. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Stormcloud

     Blackout's color scheme
is as his name implies-- a pretty dark, Decepticon-ish scheme. Purple is,
of course, the standard Decepticon dark color, and it works well here.
But the designers also put in gray, black, gold, and blue to help accent
the purple, and it works WONDERFULLY. Blackout is one of the best repaints
out of the entire Energon line, and definitely has the best paint job out
of all the basics in the line. It all comes together to make Blackout look
like a covert ops helicopter that flies around by night. And the difference
between Blackout and Stormcloud could not be greater-- whereas Stormcloud
is bright, garish, and kiddy-looking, Blackout-- even though he's the same
MOLD-- manages to look so much more serious and evil just because of his
color scheme! Blackout also has a few more paint apps than his mold brother,
such as on the vents on the side of his helicopter cockpit and on his robot
face. Boy, it sure is amazing what a great color scheme can do to a mediocre
mold...

     Blackout has an absolutely
fantastic, well-detailed, evil-looking color scheme that completely blows
Stormcloud out of the water (or air, given the alt mode). One of the best
repaints in the Energon line, though the mold itself still has all the
flaws that Stormcloud has.
