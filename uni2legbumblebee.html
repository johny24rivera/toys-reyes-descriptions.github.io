    Bumblebee's classic G1-esque
self returns in Legends form! I say "G1-esque" because due to copyright
reasons, he's not QUITE a Volkswagon Bug, though the car is made to resemble
a slightly "longer" version of that. The proportions in this mode are spot-on,
particularly for a Legends figure, and most of the necessary details are
there-- light blue headlights, silver-blue windows, a black front grill,
and the like. I do wish he had just a tad more paint though, considering
that his base color is just all yellow in this mode (besides the wheels,
of course). Maybe some tailight paint apps or door deco jobs would have
helped a little. All in all, though, a good, solid mode with no robot extras
in sight.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
is quite good for a Legends figure, and though it's certainly G1-inspired,
as far as the specific design goes it more closely resembles his
    <a href="clasbumblebee.html">
     Classics
deluxe version
    </a>
    , such as the small backpack on his upper back and the
longer feet. Speaking of the feet, they're my only major gripe about the
toy in this mode-- they're way too long proportionally, and limit the number
of poses he can do because of this. His articulation is also a bit more
limited than it could have been, even considering the limitations of the
size class-- he can move at the shoulders, at the hips, and back-and-forth
at a joint behind where his stomach is (due to the transformation), but
that's it. His feet can also move downwards SLIGHTLY at the ankles, but
you can't do this much at all without it looking awkward-- it too is mostly
a side effect of the transformation. His arms are merely molded into the
sides of the car door panels that make up his arms, but this is practically
a necessity at this price point so I can easily excuse it. His proportions
are otherwise quite good, and the backpack on his upper back doesn't get
in the way or look too "kibbly" or anything like that. The head sculpt
is also very well-done, and is quintessentially the friendly G1 Bumblebee--
plus his paint detailing is quite crisp, too. The color scheme is also
predictably broken up by black and thus looks better in this mode due to
better contrast between the main colors.

    Universe 2.0 G1 Legends
Bumblebee is a pretty decent Legends figure, with his only major drawbacks
being his rather limited articulation and oddly long feet in robot mode.
If you can afford or find Classics Bumblebee, this is a pretty good substitute--
but although this is a decent figure for the size class, Classics deluxe
Bumblebee just serves as a more interesting figure overall, so I'd recommend
him over this pint-sized version.
