    Vehicle mode is a sportscar.
I have no complaints whatsoever about this mode- it's nice all around.
A sleek, realistic-looking mode, with rubber tires, chrome bits, see-through
windows with no robot parts visible inside them; the works. Normally I'd
think that there should have been a bit more variety on the car then "just
blue", but the large flame-deco sticker on the front breaks up the only
really large spot of it, so it's all good.

    Tracks also has a sort
of sub-flight mode- attach rocket packs to the rear of the vehicle and
flip out wings from his underside, and BAM! Flight mode. It's actually
pretty cool-looking for a third mode, and is pretty passable- although
I would have made the wings a little larger.

    Tracks' robot mode is
pretty decent for a G1 fig. His arms are a bit puny, though, and he is
a bit stiff-looking-- but I suppose that's from his lack of real articulation.
(He can only move at the shoulders at two points and the elbows- pretty
standard for an early G1 figure, actually.) The wings and tires on his
shoulders and the big missile launchers on his back look hecka cool, though.
Face looks nice (albeit not show-accurate- there's not a mouth, just a
faceplate), although it would have looked better without the back of the
car right above it.

    Tracks is actually pretty
decent for a Generation 1 figure-- normally I'd recommend him, but that
steep price is a bit of a deterant. Even then, I'd still recommend him
to fans of G1 toys or completists- despite his lack of articulation, I
still find myself playing with him more than I do with most of the other
G1 toys.

      If his buddies complain that heÂ’s a
little too impressed with his own good looks, Autobot Tracks just chalks
it up to jealousy. They may be right. Fast, sleek, and a little reckless,
he prefers his sportscar vehicle mode to robot mode, and can hit speeds
up to 280 mph without breaking a sweat. Equipment includes heat-seeking
long-range incendiary missiles and blinding black beam gun. All that prevents
him from becoming a truly great Autobot warrior in his vanity, which tends
to distract him from the struggle to defeat Decepticon forces once and
for all.
