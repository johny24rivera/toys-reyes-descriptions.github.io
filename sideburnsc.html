    Mold History
   </b>
   : Side Burn (the Spychanger)'s
mold was originally planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers:
Generation 2, but it never went through. Now his mold finally sees release
for RiD!

    Side Burn's vehicle mode
is a Dodge-Viper-esque sportscar. This mode is very nice, with no extras
whatsoever. The gun is storable on the underside of this mode, and even
the robot feet on the back side have been disguised as tail pipes. There's
also an amazing amount of paint apps on this car for such a small toy-
not only are the windows and headlights painted, but there's a neat blue
flame paint app on the hood and side doors. The front bumper is painted
silver, and the rear headlights are painted bright red- colors seen nowhere
else on Side Burn, in either mode. Details like this are what show that
a lot of care was shown in making this comparatively old toy as appealing
to the eye as it could be in the package. Also, unlike
    <a href="prowl2.html">

    </a>
    , the Spychanger Side Burn's vehicle mode looks very similar to his
    <a href="sideburn.html">
     deluxe counterpart's
    </a>
    . There's a few small differences,
like the ridges on the middle sides of the car- but overall, it's a near-exact
match.

    Side Burn's robot mode
is just plain ugly. Not only is it completely different from the show version's
robot mode- which will likely confuse some kiddies who don't know the mold
is an old one- but its proportions are all wrong, even for a Spychanger.
His chest is absolutely huge, while his car's back half barely seperates
at all from its front half, leaving his upper legs very short. This makes
him easily shorter than the other Wave 1 and 2 Spychangers. The car doors
hanging off his arms don't really look that hot, either. Also, like the
other Wave 1 and 2 Spychangers, he's only movable at the shoulders in this
mode, which rather hampers his playability. The orange-yellow color of
his main body doesn't really fit with the rest of his color scheme, either.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Although Side Burn has
a great vehicle mode which very closely resembles his deluxe one, his robot
mode, like the other Wave 1 and 2 Spychangers', is horrible. Not really
recommended if you can pick up the deluxe version.
