    Optimus Prime's cybertronian
alternate mode is sort of like an aerodynamic battering ram on wheels,
with smokestacks. There is almost no seperation between the front of the
cab and the back, like there is with most Optimuses (Optimi?...). It's
almost all just one big hunk o' metal (er, plastic). It's a pretty neat
look for Prime, echoing his "future" truck mode while distancing him from
it enough that he looks like a different type of Cybertronian vehicle--
i.e., not one made for hauling stuff. The way his chest pokes through the
front looks like some nice "fake" windows, and his grill detailing is also
pretty darned nice. One thing I'm not really not fond of in this mode--
actually this toy's chief drawback, if you ask me-- is that his upper legs
just kinda sit there behind the front two-thirds of this mode, without
really collapsing in anywhere or being covered so that they're out of sight
or anything. That's kind of an obvious robot mode extra and a bit of an
eyesore. Prime could also use a few more paint apps near the front of this
mode, as some patches of his blue and red plastic are a bit TOO large without
anything to break them up, unfortunately. However, both the red and blue
have a little bit of glitter mixed in, making them look semi-metallic,
which certainly adds a bit more to those colors. The milky gray is a rather
dull, blah color, but thankfully it's not as plentiful as the nice shades
of red and black. The bits of light pinkish red actually work surprisingly
well as a minor detailing color, particularly where it contrasts well against
the black and blue. It really helps to give this Prime the "glowing red
lines/patches" look almost all of the
    <a href="wfcps3.html">
     War for Cybertron
    </a>
    designs have. The metallic bluish silver is also a nice detail color, though
as already mentioned, I wish it had been used a bit more in this mode.
Optimus Prime's rifle can be mounted on the top of this mode-- it's supposed
to be sort of folded in half so that it's not quite so obviously a rifle,
but it springs open rather easily. (It's kind of a lame gimmick anyways,
just having the rifle spring out what its normal length should be.)

    One note about Optimus
Prime's transformation as I turn the focus over to his robot mode-- it's
complicated, particularly for a deluxe. Not complicated as in "it's hard
to get everything lined up" or "there's some hard-to-understand steps"--
there's just a
    <i>
     lot
    </i>
    of steps, and it's difficult to remember in what
order you're supposed to do them all in. In robot mode he's generally quite
good, though not quite as game-accurate as most of the other War for Cybertron
toys. He has a bit of a backpack made up of some of his vehicle mode panels
that don't exactly blend in with his overall silouhette that well, as well
as some fiddly panels on his shoulders that do the same (and don't really
lock into any particular place to boot). Two of his wheels also hang behind
his back, but this is game-accurate and actually help differentiate his
silouhette a bit better. However, those aside, this is a pretty solid mode--
his proportions (except for some small shoulders, ignoring the kibble)
are spot-on, and I love details like how his grill wraps around his waist
and how they managed to get his smokestacks onto his feet in this mode.
He has considerably more visible paint apps in this mode to help break
up his colors, and they're broken up a bit more with the addition of more
gray, to boot. He's also got some great mold detailing, particularly around
his chest, abs, and waist, where there's a TON of little panel/piston/futuristic
detailing. His head detailing is a bit too "tall", however, so not quite
as game-accurate as I'd like. His rifle of choice can either be held in
his hands or on the sides of his forearm, giving you a few more options
when it comes to positioning. As for articulation, Prime can move at the
neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles, so he's pretty well-covered
in that area. However, his hip and shoulder movement is restricted a little
because of vehicle mode kibble pieces.

    Cybertronian Optimus
Prime isn't the most game-accurate out of the War for Cybertron toys, but
he's still a pretty decent toy and a nice Prime. I particularly like the
look of his vehicle mode (minus those ugly upper legs sticking out the
back). His robot mode is also pretty darn good-- particularly when it comes
to proporitions and articulation-- but some kibble problems in that mode
take a bit away from it, as well. Mildly recommended (though the "Rage
over Cybertron" deco job on the toy is slightly better than this one.)

      When he first became leader of the Autobots,
Optimus Prime was not certain he wanted the responsibility. The war with
the Decepticons was going badly, and it looked like there was no end in
sight. He vowed to himself and to the warriors under his command that he
would never surrender, never retreat, and never stop fighting until the
Decepticons were defeated.
