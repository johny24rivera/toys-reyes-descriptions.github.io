    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Stormcloud. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Stormcloud

     Topspin continues with
the "red and blue" colors that have been used on the "freebie" Club Exclusive
limbs each year up to this point, though his red is noticeably lighter
than the other primarily-red limbs. What's also odd about Topspin is that
although he has transparent parts, he's not MOSTLY transparent. He has
the same transparent cockpit and Energon parts that Stormcloud has, along
with a head, lower legs, and lower arms that are transparent. However,
his main body and helicopter tail are all a solid color. This isn't a bad
thing in and of itself-- it's just going to look really out-of-place when
we finally get the final part to the combiner and combine all of them,
since all three of the other limbs are primarily translucent (which, in
my opinion, is the primary thing that made them all so unique). The dark
blue does contrast quite well with the light red (though I wish there was
more of it), and the transparent red is a very nice-looking "cherry" hue.
He's also got quite a few silver paint apps on his body, all of which look
great and help to add a bit more variety beyond just "red and blue".

     Topspin's color scheme
isn't bad (though the red could have been dulled a bit)-- my main complaints
about him regard the fact that, firstly, when have you ever seen a blue-and-red
helicopter? And, secondly, he's NOT mostly transparent like the other Club
exclusive combiner limbs, which is going to make him look out-of-place
when we can finally combine all of them and takes away from his uniqueness.
My least favorite out of the exclusive combiner limbs.

       Something happened to Topspin a long
time ago; something he only remembers as pain, and terror, and a landscape
of twisted, shifting metal lit by the strobelight chaos of laser fire through
rolling smoke. It is the last time Topspin remembers feeling anything.

       Eons later he found himself drifting,
alone, though the vast darkness. Lost for years, he slowly ran out of energy,
and his systems shut down one by one. Eventually, his inert body plunged
through a wormhole and ended up on one of the transit pads in Axiom Nexus.

       Handed off by processing authorities
to Alpha Trion, he awoke to find himself staring into the face of another
natural leader. Never before had he met a being with such overwhelming
force of personality, or such deep conviction. Here was the leader that
would guide him to what he sought.

       Alpha Trion saw instantly what Topspin
was; after all, he'd been waiting for someone like him since arriving in
Axiom Nexus. He saw in Topspin the fruition of all his grand goals, and
immediately set his plans into motion. He promised Topspin all he could
want and more. Telling the plain truth for perhaps the first time in decades,
he told Topspin that the reward he sought for so long waited just beyond
the veil of the bleed, on Alpha Trion's home world.
