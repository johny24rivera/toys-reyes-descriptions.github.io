    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations voyager Autobot
Springer. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations

     Sandstorm may technically
be a remold, but he is one HEAVY remold, to the point where even his transformation
is a bit different! Most of the more-visible parts have been completely
retooled, with only a lot of the more "interior" parts-- the robot upper
legs, waist, and feet, the back, some side panels-- are kept the exact
same when compared with Springer. Sandstorm's color scheme is-- as you'd
expect-- pretty accurate to G1, being mostly a dull sandy yellow, orange,
and black. These colors contrast against and complement each other quite
nicely, and the paint apps are kept varied enough throughout all three
of Sandstorm's modes that-- with the exception of perhaps the top middle
of the helicopter mode-- there isn't too large a section of any one color.
The silver and gunmetal gray accent colors work quite well, though I wish
the silver had been a bit darker, to provide a bit more contrast against
the relatively light yellow/orange parts of the color scheme. It's certainly
not a bad color scheme-- it's quite fitting-- but it's just a bit too yellow-dominated
for my tastes, given that yellow's one of my least favorite colors. The
transparent plastic is also a bit underwhelming, being a very pale blue
that doesn't really fit in all that well with the other colors and isn't
dark enough to "hide" anything inside the windows, either. A darker transparent
blue would have worked much better, in my opinion.

     Sandstorm obviously
has a lot of mold changes, though his general "structure" is the same.
Thus, I'll be running through his three modes briefly, highlighting major/noteworthy
changes. First, Springer's car mode has become an armored dune buggy mode
on Sandstorm. This mode has a considerably more "pumped up" look compared
to Springer's car mode, to nearly absurd levels. The most obvious change
here are HUGE rear wheels, which honestly look a little ridiculous here,
though their functionality in helicopter mode makes me forgive this aspect
a bit. With the elimination of the rear "spoiler" pieces on Springer, there's
not much of a back end to this mode on Sandstorm, though you'll rarely
be looking at him from that angle, anyways. There's several armored bumpers
and the like molded onto the front of this mode, which, along with the
armored windows fitted over Sandstorm's regular side windows and bulkier
orange roof, really makes Sandstorm look like he's ready to tumble with
anybody. (That said, I wish the orange roof piece clipped in a bit more
solidly to the rest of the toy instead of just folding roughly in place.)
Having parts fold down over the side windows also partially masks the obvious
fracture in between the front and side windows because of the transformation,
so I like that cover-up bit. Sandstorm also has a new weapon-- a different
type of push-firing missile launcher than Springer, and one that only fires
one missile as opposed to two. It's still a neat design, though, and bulkier
than Springer's gun. The sword has been eliminated from this version because
of some extra, bulkier parts.

     Sandstorm's helicopter
mode is a VTOL, twin-turbine helicopter, like an osprey, and is my favorite
of his three modes. I LOVE how inventive it was of the design team to take
the rear dune buggy wheels and turn them into the VTOL engines. Folding
the dune buggy's roof back to provide Sandstorm with a more substantial
tailfin was also a stroke of genius, as not only does it make the tops
of the alt modes look more different, but it makes the rear section here
not so obviously have a divider line down the middle that becomes the robot
mode legs. The knee/landing gear have also been shortened to deal with
the fact that Sandstorm's rear section doesn't angle up as much as Springer's,
so no need to worry about that. The armored portion of the dune buggy makes
the front of the helicopter mode look a bit more beefy and combat-ready,
which certainly fits Sandstorm's personality.

     Sandstorm's robot mode
is definitely the mode that has the most in common with Springer's design
(outside of the colors, of course). With the exception of the head and
some details along his lower legs, all of the changes to his "core Springer"
parts are the result of changes made to his other modes, such as the turbine
wings hanging off his back, the extra "armor" on his shoulders and chest,
and orange roof-backpack. The orange roof-backpack I don't mind (it calls
back a bit more to his G1 silouhette), but the turbines REALLY stick out
from the back, and not in an aesthetically pleasing manner-- though you
can fold them inwards a bit, making them stick out a bit less. The circular
detailing on his legs is quite nice and helps him stand out a bit more
from Springer aesthetically on said legs, as do the shorter kneecaps made
from his landing gear. His headsculpt is excellently done and a modern
update to his G1 head design, with a fairly normal-looking off-white face
and transparent blue eyes with excellent light piping.

     Generations Sandstorm
is one heck of a mold re-use, essentially being his own toy despite sharing
a base mold with Springer. It's an excellent design, and given how much
has been "changed up"-- particularly in the alt modes-- I'd recommend this
toy even if you already have Generations voyager Springer. That said, because
of the oddity of his huge wheels in buggy mode and how his turbines hang
so unceremoniously off of his back in robot mode, I'd have to recommend
Springer slightly over Sandstorm if you only want to get one.

       Sandstorm lives for action. His only
real fear is a fear of boredom. As a result, he takes unnecessary risks,
both in combat and out-- risks that can sometimes threaten the success
of his mission. He lives fast, loud and dangerously-- traits that make
him fun to hang out with most of the time. But his fellow Autobots are
getting a little sick of his habit of giving away his position to the Decepticons
just so he has the opportunity to enjoy a fight.
