      I'm not used to reviewing
G.I. JOE figures-- I'll leave to that to the experts who collect these
figures, so in terms of an actual numerical rating I'll leave Old Snake
alone and focus on his features. "Old Snake" is from a Season 3 episode
of the original Transformers series, in which Cobra Commander is old and
in hiding-- hence the Cobra Commander silver mask for a face, but he has
an old hat and trenchcoat on. The hat and trenchcoat are pretty much perfectly
colored, being just the right shade of tan to make it look it's made of
leather (or at least faux leather). He's got black fingerless gloves on,
with a bit of his skin color showing through, but underneath his jacket
you can see a bit of Cobra Commander's uniform still there-- beyond the
obvious aforementioned mask, he's got a bit of light blue underneath the
collar, dark blue pants, and high black boots. As one final little "hint"
as to who he is, he has red bands around his arms. He has what I assume
is the standard JOE articulation, with movement at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows (at two points), wrist and mid-body rotation, and
movement at the hips (limited because of his trenchcoat), knees (at two
points), and ankles (at two points), so he's pretty poseable. As far as
accessories, he comes with a small handgun which can be stored in a little
pouch on the side of his trenchcoat, and a backpack which can be strapped
around his shoulders and plugged into a slot on his back. However, the
backpack straps seem pretty cheap-- simply trying to put it on, the straps
snapped, and I wasn't stretching them that much. That was kind of a bummer.
As with all Fun Pub G.I. JOE figures, he comes with a base with little
pegs for the holes on his feet to plug into, with a COBRA symbol on the
base along with his name on the front.

        Once resigned to slither back into the
shadows and live out the rest of his life coiled in quiet solitude, an
encounter with four heroic Autobots-- extraterrestrial robots from the
planet Cybertron-- changed Old Snake's vision of retirement. Gone was the
reverie and aimlessness, cut down by the sharp return of an ambition for
absolute power. With the incarceration of crime lord Victor Drath, a power
vacuum in the underbelly of society gave Old Snake access to the perfect
collection of condemnable and reprehensible individuals whom he could use
to shape the new face of COBRA. For true muscle in the new day and age,
however, he still needed something with the might to challenge any adversary,
be it G.I. JOE, Earth Defense Command, or Autobot. Focusing on his expertise
in experimental weapons technologies, Old Snake set about building the
next COBRA army with steel plates and circuit boards rather than flesh
and blood.

not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

          This set comes with two
identical Prime Soundwave redecoes, which are meant to be transformable
versions of COBRA B.A.T. drones, which basically look like vanilla robot
drones with jet wings on their backs. Thus, the jet mode and the red paint
app on the front of the nosecone looks like the faces from the "original"
B.A.T. drones. As for the rest of the color scheme, it SEEMS to just be
based on something that looks cool and not referencing the B.A.T. drones
directly, given from what little info from the TF Wiki I've been able to
glean. I could totally be wrong about that, though. Regardless, The black
and orangish yellow color combo is pretty close to your "Reverse Bumblebee"
redecoes in terms of the amount of each, and it's a fairly decent color
scheme, though a more straightforward yellow would've looked better, methinks.
It's not a huge downside, though, since most of the yellow is used on small
parts or wings, so there isn't one huge area of yellow on the drones. There's
also some nice DeceptiCOBRA symbols on the wings in this color. There's
some silver on a few of the robot parts, like the claws and chest, which
works pretty well against the black; not so much against the yellow. One
oddity about the B.A.T. drones is that on their upper chest, the left side
is painted yellow while the right side is painted black. Not sure what
that's about; mirroring a chest strap perhaps? The best part of the drones'
color schemes are the really nice paint apps of red and dull forest green
on the "Nightshriek" drones that pop out of the chests. I really wish that
dull forest green was used more on the toy, it's a really neat color. Another
neat color is the transparent cherry red used for the "faces" in robot
mode, which both mirror the paint apps on the nosecone in vehicle mode
and just look cool against the black and silver.

           Old Snake's first attempt to harness
a strength similar to the Autobots, that he once tried to capture, resulted
in varied results. The hulking robot of Old Snake's creation truly did
possess brute force as well as great intelligence, however, the interference
from former General Clayton "Hawk" Abernathy and the Earth Defense Command
caused the loss of any semblance of control over Serpent O.R. Not willing
to commit the same error again, Old Snake decided to forgo intellect in
his next endeavor. Mimicking the programming from COBRA's prolific but
now-outdated Battle Android Troopers, Old Snake upgraded the COBRA B.A.T.
with added size as well as the ability to disguise themselves as Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Although not quite the height of the Autobots,
the lithe and agile Stealth B.A.T. can maneuver in ways that most of the
robots from Cybertron cannot even imagine. To further aid in espionage
as well as assault operations, each Stealth B.A.T. also features a detachable
bat-like Nightshriek remote unit that can access small spaces and create
havoc through sabotage and data breaches.

           A Stealth B.A.T. has the potential to
become the truly perfect soldier, with the sound of their mighty steel
boots causing fear and panic wherever they march. With each attack that
they commit, COBRA comes closer to regaining the greatness and glory it
once possessed!

           Although this is both
a GIJOE and Transformers club joint exclusive, this set appeals vastly
more to JOE fans. As a Transformers fan I have basically no interest in
Old Snake, and although the Stealth B.A.T. drones take a great mold and
give it a better color scheme, as far as characterization they obviously
have none and I had no idea what a B.A.T. drone was before this set, having
not followed GIJOE. As such, unless you're desperate for more Prime Soundwave
redecoes or really have an attachment to that one episode of G1 where Old
Snake appears, this set is probably a pass for most TF fans.
