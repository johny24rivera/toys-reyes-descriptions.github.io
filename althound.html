    Hound's Alternator form
is a Jeep Wrangler. As you'd expect from an Alternator, his vehicle mode
is practically flawless, and has many realistic details. Besides perfect
proportions, he's got clear headlights, side doors that open and close,
adjustable seats and steering wheel, and rubber wheels with spring suspension-
the latter not a common feature on Alternators. (Although, because of this,
his wheels can't turn from side to side.) You can also lift up his hood
and find an engine inside. (It's actually made from the back of his arms.)
Hound's color scheme is also great and suiting for a Jeep Wrangler, and
overall, he's very close to his G1 alt mode in this form. There's only
two, rather minor, problems I have with this mode. For one, the rear seats
aren't really proportional (the part where you sit needs to be wider).
And secondly, you can see a bit of Hound's waist and upper legs poking
out from the bottom of the vehicle in this mode. It's definitely not too
distracting, but it's there. But it's still a great, great vehicle mode.

    In robot mode, Alternator
Hound resembles his G1 self to a reasonable degree, as well. He's got the
same general chest, leg, and back design as his predecessor. His head is
also spot-on with his G1 self. Hound's overall proportions are great in
this mode, with pretty much everything right on target. His arms could
be a little longer, but that's really about it. Hound also has excellent
articulation- he can move at pretty much any place you can reasonably expect
on a toy of this size, including some mighty fine ankle articulation, to
boot. The hip joints on mine tend to be a little loose, though this could
just be my toy. Hound does have a few noticeable flaws in this mode, though-
namely that some of his jeep extras tend to be a bit cumbersome. The wheels
on the sides of his hips restrict movement there a little, and the jeep
parts on the sides of his legs are asymmetrical (namely because of the
spare tire on his left leg). The interior jeep parts on his back also don't
fit together much, and just kinda... hang there. His chest is also almost
completely hollow- look at it from the side and it's basically just a shell,
which means you can pretty much see right through his body from that perspective.
He also isn't the most stable Alternator, as he's a little back-heavy when
standing straight. The doors behind his arms help complement the mode some,
though. And his gun, though really small, fits in a rather creative place
when not in use- inside his spare tire! So unlike, say,
    <a href="altsideswipe.html">
     Sideswipe
    </a>
    or
    <a href="altsmokescreen.html">
     Smokescreen
    </a>
    , Hound can store his gun
in robot mode without carrying it in his hand. He also has a panel on the
top of his chest that flips to reveal an Autobot symbol in this mode, while
it's just plain green in his vehicle mode. This helps the "real model car"
look that the Alternators are going for in their alt modes, while still
showing you his allegiance prominently in robot mode. Very nice.

    Alternator Hound is
a fine addition to any older Transfan's collection, but be warned-- he
is a little difficult to transform the first few times, especially his
legs. So I wouldn't recommend this toy for real young Transfans. But if
that's not you, then Hound is definitely a recommended buy, as long as
you don't mind some extras in robot mode.
