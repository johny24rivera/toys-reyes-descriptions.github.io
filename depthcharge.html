    Beast mode is a metallized
manta ray. This mode is very nicely done, with the only downside being
that his eyes can disconnect a little easily. Although there isnt much
available movement in this mode except for the wings, it is one of the
few transmetals that has the body structure a lot like its actual animal.

    Vehicle mode is a manta
ray with his wings moved to a vertical positon. This isnt much of a vehicle
mode, although it looks like a Cybertron Skyhopper (if youre not sure
what a Skyhopper is, watch the episode
    <i>
     Deep Metal
    </i>
    ).

    Robot mode has some
big extras, but is otherwise fine. He can shoot discs out of his chest,
and this is the only weapon of any of the Beast Wars toys that has more
than three missles for one weapon. His end of his manta ray tail becomes
a spear, and his little remora becomes a gun that can fire two missles
at once! (However, this is only how many missles he has.) His wings and
front end of the manta ray tail stick out on his backside, making it hard
for him to stand up. The wings would complement the robot mode is they
weren't so huge in comparison to the rest of the body. His waist sort of
looks odd because of the transformation sequence, also, and his manta ray
feelers stick out on his knees.

    A very nice toy, overall;
a lot of extras in robot mode, though.

      A magnificent giant soars through the
oceans in regal silence. Depth Charge was commissioned by Optimus Primal
to act as a first line of defense against Predacon undersea aggressors.
Though he would rather study military strategies than execute them, Depth
Charge is a dedicated fighter and inspired leader. Nuclear cybershark drone
conducts recon missions, doubles as reinforcement in battle, and fires
dual proton torpedoes. Intermediate space-cruiser mode can achieve planetary
orbit or withstand the deepest oceanic pressures. As a robot, he fires
shrapnel grenades from his chest and can maintain a force field for five
mega cycles. With unshakable nerves and Energon-cutlass in hand, Depth
Charge leads his brave platoon into battle.
