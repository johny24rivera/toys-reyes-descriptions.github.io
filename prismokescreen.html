    Smokescreen's alternate
mode is a sportscar, and looks fairly sharp and show-accurate in this mode;
the proportions are pretty much spot-on when compared to the show model,
and except for a little bit of the lower arms visible inside the transparent
windows, there's no robot mode extras visible whatsoever in this mode.
Unlike his
    <a href="pricysmokescreen.html">
     initial Cyberverse release
    </a>
    ,
this version of Smokescreen also comes with an accurate white deco (it's
more of an off-white, but it's close enough). He's also got some really
nice blue stripes across the front hood and top, and mixed red-and-blue
curved stripes along the sides, with the sides of the spoiler also being
painted light red. However, even though this is for the MOST part show-accurate,
it's still missing the complete stripes down his roof, which sort of end
in a haphazard manner around where the windows end. The designs on his
doors should also be checkered, not curved stripes. I do like that they
kept the "38" on his doors, though, in a light homage to his
    <a href="g1smokescreen.html">
     G1
self
    </a>
    . The whole color scheme comes together and looks quite good here;
a little more paint could've been used on the backside, but otherwise his
red, white, and blue scheme looks great and very Autobot-y, with the transparent
yellow headlights and transparent pale purple windows giving a little more
color variety. (I personally would've liked the windows to be darker to
better hide the arms within, though.) Of note, though-- the paint on Smokescreen's
roof that covers up part of his transparent pieces is a little prone to
scratching, so beware. Smokescreen's mold detailing is fairly sparse in
this mode to emphasize the sleek sportscar look, but a few spots like his
front and rear bumpers have some pretty impressive detailing, as is the
norm for the Prime toyline. Of course, this isn't just a Prime toy-- it's
also a Beast Hunters toy! Smokescreen comes with optional armor that fits
over the front portion of this mode-- a nice milky dull blue that complements
his dark blue while also contrasting well against the white. Having all
of these spikes coming off his front end really makes him looks "meaner",
and I love how it looks here. There's also a "net" piece that fits over
the spring-loaded projectile on his gun, which honestly looks a bit goofy
since it looks too "thick" to work as an actual net-- but hey, at least
it makes his gun look more unique. There's three ports for Smokescreen's
gun (or other 5mm-compatible weapons) in this mode; on the top of his hood,
and on the sides of his spoiler, though with the net on it can't plug very
well into his spoiler ports; not enough vertical clear space.

    Smokescreen's transformation
is a fair bit more complicated than it might seem-- in fact, he's probably
one of the most complex of all the new-mold Beast Hunters toys, and just
a few steps shy of getting into the "hard" category, particularly when
getting him back into vehicle mode, where everything has to fit just right.
The end result is a fairly decent-looking robot mode, but not one without
its problems. The main issue with Smokescreen's robot mode is the kibble,
and the biggest offenders here are easily the roof and front car halves
behind his lower arms. I mean, they just hang there-- they don't get in
the way of articulation much, but they're ugly and not at all show-accurate.
There's also some bits of his car mode on the side of his lower legs and
below his feet, though these at least help to "bulk up" those pieces a
bit. Smokescreen's car doors fit behind his upper back and shoulders, looking
fairly cool in the process and actually enhancing his silouhette instead
of subtracting from it. I'm also impressed with how well nearly everything
tabs together on his main body-- there's a bunch of little pieces that
all have to tab together here, and a slight miscalculation could have made
this a loose disaster-- butthey tab together fairly solidly. Two of his
wheels actually turn and fit into the midst of his body, which is ingeniously
done and the best part of the transformation, in my opinion. His shoulder
panels cover up noticeable gaps in between the sides of his chest and his
arms-- which is appreciated, but the gap is still there regardless and
looks a little unsightly. Smokescreen's arms are also a bit on the thin
side, and could have stood to be more three-dimensional. Proportionally
Smokescreen's head is a touch on the small side too, and though it's a
great headsculpt, the off-white color mutes some of the details like his
smirk (nice blue painting on his sides, forehead, and "chin strap", though).
The "car chest" detailing is entirely faux, and little bit too spread out
and flat for my liking, though getting the actual car front to be his chest
would probably have looked considerably worse. Smokescreen's mold detailing
fits in with the "stylized, simple metal panels on top of one each other"
Prime aesthetic very well here, and there's a nice mix of blue and red
paint detailing on his lower arms and lower legs. He could've used some
paint on his shoulders, but other than that I'm not complaining about the
color variety here. Smokescreen can obviously hold his net-gun in either
of his fists, and his car-front Hunter armor piece fits over and behind
his shoulders. In this mode, though, this armor piece honestly looks a
little goofily-placed and restrictive-- not to mention that you have to
bend it slightly to get it to tab in. Given that this armor piece is of
the bendy plastic variety, this can lead to warping over a fairly short
time, and is generally a disappointment here. For articulation, Smokescreen
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points, along with shoulder-armor
movement at one point), elbows (at two points), waist, hips (at two points),
and back-and-forth movement at the knees and ankles. Other than sideways
knee movement, Smokescreen's got just about all you could reasonably expect
on a toy this size, and with his large feet and good weight distribution
he's quite balanced.

    Deluxe Smokescreen--
despite being yet another Autobot sportscar-- has a pretty unique transformation
with some nice twists, and an incredibly solid alt mode. His robot mode
does have some kibble issues, particularly with the arms, which also have
some proportional issues. His Beast Hunter armor is a nice touch so that
you can either have Smokescreen "normal" or "spiked up", though the warping
of the larger armor piece in robot mode was just a bad design choice and
is worrisome. A slightly above-average deluxe, though his poor arms in
robot mode pull him down a fair bit-- if it wasn't for that, he'd be an
easy recommendation. As is, mildly recommended.

       With Bumblebee injured and Bulkhead
near total shutdown, it's up to Smokescreen to discover where these new
and dangerous Predacons are coming from. Luckily, the Autobot trickster
is also a capable spy, and soon he finds himself creeping through the shadows
of a remote Decepticon lab. At first, he thinks the place is abandoned.
Then he discovers a room lined with large glass chambers, each one filled
with a strange, murky liquid, and the vague outline of a beastly machine.
Satisfied that he's discovered exactly what Optimus Prime needs to know,
he turns to leave, only to find Shockwave blocking his way. "You should
not have come here," the Decepticon scientist says, raising his laser cannon.
