    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Arcee. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Arcee

     Flamewar (LOVE the name)
is the third use of the Energon Arcee mold for Botcon 2005, but boy is
she lookin' fine. Black, red, and purple is pretty much a defacto "really
eeevil Decepticon" color scheme, and Flamewar certainly fits that description
as a special agent! She also has great new deco "flame" patterns on her
upper arms, upper legs, and forehead, and all look really good against
the black. The dark transparent "grapey" purple plastic used for her Energon
chip and crossbow also looks very nice, and is my personal favorite of
the various transparent Energon colors used for this mold. Her head isn't
remolded like
     <a href="chromia.html">
      Chromia's
     </a>
     or
     <a href="flareup.html">
      Flareup's
     </a>
     ,
and is instead a direct repaint of the Energon Arcee head, but it looks
REALLY awesome-- the red used for the rear section, the silver face, the
black-and-orange forehead, and those eeevil red eyes go together perfectly.
I had no idea this toy could look so evil! Oh, and in case you're wondering,
yes, Flamewar does have the mold's Autobot spark crystal replaced with
a Decepticon one.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Of addition note is
that in addition to being a Botcon 2005 exclusive, Flamewar was only available
("free") if you bought the expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked
the set up in person at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt going
to be worth quite a lot of money.

     Flamewar is an outstanding
redeco, with some dynamite color choices and some great flame paint apps.
This is as good as the mold's going to get, folks, though obviously the
prices it's going for can offset that if you didn't attend the convention
in the first place. Next to

       Flamewar was one of the original members
of Megatron's army during the first Great War. Since that time, she has
served as everything from a warrior to a scientist. In her current role
as agent of the Tripredicus Council, she hopes to help guide the Predacon
Alliance into a position of power and one day, defeat the Autobots and
the Maximals. She holds disdain for the current crop of Decepticon Generals,
including Deathsaurus. Flamewar sees them all as pale imitators of Megatron,
whose loss she mourns to this day. While on the outside she maintains bravado,
deep down inside, Flamewar yearns for days long gone with sadness and anger.

       Abilities: Having stolen the plans for
her current body from the Autobots, Flamewar made modifications to increase
her abilities. Her body is able to generate a low level force field, which
virtually eliminates friction, allowing her to achieve high speed in both
robot and vehicle modes. Her vehicle mode has been clocked at speeds in
excess of 400 mph. Her weapon has greater range and accuracy than the original
plans dictated as well. Flamewar is incredibly intelligent and experienced
in combat.

       Weakness: Flamewar's tendency to look
back at the past can sometimes cloud her judgement regarding her present
actions.
