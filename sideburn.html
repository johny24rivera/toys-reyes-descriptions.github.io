    Vehicle mode is a sportscar.
This mode looks very nice, and is my personal favorite of the original
Car Brother's (
    <a href="xbrawn.html">
     X-Brawn
    </a>
    , Side Burn, and
    <a href="ridprowl.html">
     Prowl
    </a>
    )
vehicle modes. The paint detailing is wonderful, and the light blue "flames"
on the front and sides of the car look great. The silver-and-red engine
looks VERY cool. There is not that much actual mold detailing in this mode,
however, which is rather dissapointing. Luckily, this is mostly covered
up by the flame detailing. There are practically no extras in this mode
whatsoever (although Side Burn's missile stored on the underside of the
car may be a bit obvious from a side view of the right side of the vehicle,
since it sticks out a bit from the rest of the underside). The clear plastic
used, however, isn't dark enough to blot out the very obvious robot parts
on the inside of the car; a darker-tinted plastic would have made this
mode look quite a bit better in that respect. Still, this is a very nice
mode overall.

    One note about Side
Burn's transformation: It is EXTREMELY hard, especially when transforming
from robot to vehicle mode, since you have to get all the pieces in just
the right place. Even after transforming it several times, it still takes
me quite a while to transform this guy. In fact, it gets to the point of
being frustrating sometimes. Because of this, I'd only recommend Side Burn
to those who are patient with transforming their TFs, despite how cool
he looks.

    Robot mode is a bit
of a dissapointment when compared with the vehicle mode. It's not particularly
bad, but there are car extras everywhere in this mode. Large car panels
hang off of Side Burn's back, with no position to "lock" into, and there's
also the entire roof of the car attached to Side Burn's left arm. I suppose
it could be used as some kind of shield, but it's still rather weak. One
of the car wheels also sticks out rather blatantly under Side Burn's upper
right arm. The front car bumper is attached to Side Burn's right shoulder,
as a kind of shoulder panel, but it's rather flat and long, so it tends
to snap off its ball joint easily during transformation. Side Burn's other
extras in this mode are also long and thin, so it would be rather easy
for someone young to break those parts. Because of this fact and his hard
transformation, I would NOT recommend giving Side Burn to a youngin' under
10 or so, even though the box says "Ages 5 and up". On the positive side,
Side Burn is very articulated in this mode, with several ball joints on
each of his arms and legs. His chest looks very nice with the car engine
on it, and because of Side Burn's overall asymmetry, he looks like a "
    <a href="bwtransmetals2toys.html">
     Transmetal

    </a>
    " version of a car. His face is very nice-looking, with a "targeting
reticle" over one eye and a few asymmetrical patches of transparent plastic
on his forehead. I'm not sure I like the hot pink used for his eyes and
the dot on his waist, however... Side Burn's feet are rather small in this
mode, which makes it a bit hard for him to stand up and stay up in this
mode, especially since he's slightly back-heavy.Â  The white paint
on his upper legs also doesn't quite match the white plastic used for the
inside of them, but this is a relatively minor problem that you probably
wouldn't notice at a first glance. Side Burn has not just one, but two
weapons in this mode- a transmetal silver "scissor"-like gun made of one
piece (which can be stored on his robot rear in car mode, even though the
instructions don't say this), and a missle launcher made of the rear car
bumper. Rather odd, but still functional. The chrome red Autobot symbol
on Side Burn's left arm looks pretty neat aesthetically, albeit slightly
more curved than the usual Autobot symbol is.

    Side Burn has an excellent
vehicle mode, but his robot mode is quite a bit extra-ridden. Although
he's not that bad of a toy, because of his very hard transformation and
the fact that he's relatively easy to break, I'd only recommend him for
older Transfans.

      Side Burn got a new spark engine and
was amazed at the results. His speed and acceleration power jumped up to
infinite levels, and he now is able to warp short distances on the highway.
He loves to go fast just to enjoy the blur of the world shooting past him,
but he knows his speed is important in the fight against the Predacons.
