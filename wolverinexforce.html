    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Wolverine. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Wolverine's TF toy gets
another repaint, this time in his monochromatic X-Force costume colors.
I must admit I have some nagging ethical issues about this-- why is Hasbro
releasing Wolverine in his X-Force costume's color scheme, when the X-Force
comic is an extremely gory and dark read, definitely not something you'd
want kids flipping through? Still, that aside, this toy gets across the
"dark" feeling of X-Force very well-- as opposed to Wolverine's previous
costumes which had yellow as a primary color, the only yellow on this dude
is on the headlights. Black is main color, along with a couple shades of
dull gray/silver to round things out. And man, what I wouldn't give for
the silver-gray used on Wolverine here to be used on mainline TFs. Far
from looking too milky, uninteresting, and "plasticky" like gray tends
to on mainline Transformers, the gray plastic used on Wolvie here has a
bit of a metallic silvery shade to it, which manages to look almost painted
without it actually BEING painted. The actual painted silver paint apps
look quite good as well (of course), following the traditional Wolverine
"striped" colors and fitting in quite nicely against the black. To throw
in a bit of color, Wolverine's eyes, X-badge on his waist, and the interior
of his wheels are all painted red, which goes PERFECTLY with the other
colors. In fact, it goes so perfectly I wish there was a bit more of it,
even though overall Wolverine has enough paint apps. (Maybe a bit more
on the legs or chest in Mech mode?) I also wish the paint used for the
windows in vehicle mode was a bit lighter, for contrast's sake.

     No mold changes have
been made to X-Force Wolverine.

     X-Force Wolverine isn't
for fans who hate monochromatic schemes, but even for one that is mostly
just different shades on the white-to-black scale, it's pulled off very
well, with very metallic-looking shades of gray plastic and some nice silver
paint apps, with a few red paint apps thrown in there to give the toy at
least a little bit of color. Normally I don't like toys without any "real"
colors in them, but this one looks dynamite overall. Recommended over the
other versions of this mold.

       When the X-Men need a dirty job done
quietly, they turn to Wolverine and his X-Force. With this new battle suit
designed for speed, stealth and firepower, Wolverine can accomplish the
most dangerous missions without ever being seen.
