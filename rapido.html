not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Deluxe Prowl.

     Rapido here is the only
one of the "bonafide" G2 toys in the set, interestingly enough. Neither
a G1 character in G2 colors nor a late European G1/G2-era character, Rapido
was a mass-release G2 toy and a G2 character. In vehicle mode he actually
looks pretty normal color-wise-- red and black with some silver is hardly
a "loud G2" color scheme, and they all go quite well together. The contrast
of the black against the moderately light red is particularly striking,
and although it's used in very small amounts I do oddly like the pinkish
red stripes near the rear of this mode. It's in robot mode where Rapido's
G2 heritage becomes more apparent, as many of his interior robot parts
are a light seafoam green, which fits... okay... with the black, but rather
clashes with the other colors. There's also some light milky gray, which
is just as boring here as on any other toy. Rapido also has a fair number
of paint apps, with some yellow, gold, and white paint apps really helping
to break up the colors, particularly in vehicle mode.

     Rapido has a new head
mold, highly reminiscent of his original G2 toy's head, but a bit more
defined and less square. It looks really nice and is a solid sculpt-- no
complaints here. Otherwise, Rapido has no mold changes from the Universe
2.0 Prowl release of this mold except for the removal of the light siren,
which has already been done on other redecoes of this mold.

     If you want a bonafide
G2-toy upgrade and aren't too fond of loud color schemes, Rapido's your
bot out of this set. His sea foam green does clash in robot mode, but again,
that's part of what makes him G2, and it's hardly a huge deal when you
compare it to some of the obnoxious color schemes on some of the other
toys in this year's set-- especially since his color scheme's pretty "normal"
if you ignore that one caveat.

       Though he is a natural-born leader,
expert tactician and master of battlefield improvisation, the suave and
level-headed Rapido has no desire to lead. He would rather be living the
high life on the international racing circuit again, but so long as someone
threatens his home planet Earth, Rapido will step up to defend it with
his life. He defers leadership of the Earth-based Autobots to his friend
Autobot Spark, but has been authorized by Optoimus Prime to assume command
of any unit functioning on Earth as required. His Axelerator Cannon launches
a barrage of lead slugs at hypervelocity, plus he carries twin low-yield
photon missile launchers. Accidental exposure to forestonite gas has given
him a body that matches his mind for speed; he can instantly launch into
a 750mph run for bursts up to 15 seconds long.
