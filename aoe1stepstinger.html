    Finally! A toy of Stinger
that actually is a new mold and has the correct alt mode-- that is, a Pagani
Zonda, one of the fastest cars on the planet. As you'd expect from a licensed
alt mode, the proportions are pretty much perfect in this mode, and the
robot mode extras are VERY minimal. The tips of the toes are a little obvious
from the back end, and looking in through the open windows it's obvious
there's not a driver's seat in there, but both of these are pretty darn
minimal extras and easily overlooked. The red plastic serves as a nice
base for Stinger, with the black diagonal stripes on the sides and the
large "swoop" of black around the main windows looking great and contrasting
quite well with the red-- it's a fairly basic color scheme, but it still
looks pretty good. There's also a bit of silver on the front headlights,
but sadly the front grill isn't painted black, nor is anything on the back
end painted, either. I'm normally a fan of large faction symbols, but in
this case the big Decepticon symbol on Stinger's hood actually helps to
add a little extra color here, and contrasts against the black quite well.
(That said, it's the wrong kind of Decepticon symbol, being the G1 symbol
as opposed to the movie "narrower eyes" version.) As you'd expect from
a car with this aerodynamic of a look, the mold detailing in this mode
is fairly minimal, but still accurate-- and there are intricate details
where required, such as on the wheels and the honeycomb-like detailing
(get it?) on his front grill.

    To transform Stinger
to robot mode, you simply push in on the little button on his windshield,
which causes the vehicle bits to separate a bit-- then you just stand him
up. To get him back to vehicle mode, you simply lightly push those pieces
back together. He uses the same one-step transformation gimmick originally
pioneered in the line by
    <a href="aoe1steplockdown.html">
     Lockdown
    </a>
    ,
and thus shares many of the same positives and negatives. Sure, it's not
a very impressive transformation, but it largely gets the job done, with
a fairly proportional robot mode for a one-step changer. There is some
substantial kibble, though, with the doors hanging off the side arms, the
entire roof and top middle section of the car hanging back behind the main
body, and-- on a lesser note-- there being a noticeable gap in between
the bottom of the leg pieces and the foot pieces, which are molded into
the back-halves of the car mode that form Stinger's legs. From a side view
Stinger looks a bit two-dimensional with a large backpack, but from the
front he looks pretty okay despite the extras, which aren't as egregious
as on some of the other one-step changers-- all in all, it's not that bad
of a trade-off. That said, because of this transformation, the vehicle
mode pieces don't really tab together at all, and the vehicle mode bits
can move around a little without much force, which is kind of annoying.
The mold detailing takes a MAJOR uptick in this mode, with many of the
movie-accurate details appearing in this mode, such as the springs along
his stomach, the stylized fake vehicle front-chest, the rather evil-looking
helmeted headsculpt, and the alternating sharp points and curves on his
legs, making him very much look like an "evil doppleganger" of 'Bee in
this mode in terms of his general detailing. The red and black is broken
up more in this mode than in vehicle mode, with more of each color on each
part of the robot-- no one large part is solely one color. That said, not
extending the silver paint app on the abs down to the crotch is a bit of
a head-scratcher, and I'm not sure why Stinger's eyes are painted black,
as opposed to the bright green they are in the movie, which looks MUCH
cooler and provides a bit more color. As with all one-step changers with
this transformation scheme, sadly Stinger can only move a bit back-and-forth
at his elbows-- otherwise he's a statue in this mode.

    Stinger's design is
one of the better one-step changer designs, but it's a real shame that
this was really the only option given to collectors who wanted a Stinger
toy that actually LOOKED like Stinger instead of... y'know, a redeco of
someone else. It took about 4 years to rectify this (which shows how late
I am with this review, but whatevs), but I'd recommend this toy a lot less
now that Stinger has a deluxe "Studio Series" toy. That said, for those
who want a quick-to-transform version of the silent Decepticon doppleganger,
it's certainly better-than-average for the subline.
