    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Defense Hot Shot.

     Springer's new form is
admittedly one of the molds that takes a bit of stretch to accept it as
its G1 namesake. The original Springer was a triple-changer, this one transforms
into an armored car (the least-recognizable of the three modes the original
Springer transformed into). The color scheme is flipped compared to the
G1 toy, with more gray than green being visible. The head is pretty close
to G1 Springer's already, though so no remolding was needed there. The
mold also already comes equipped with Springer's trademark sword, so even
though it's more of a stretch than the other Botcon '07 exclusives, you
can still definitely see the resemblance. Homage aside, though, Springer
has an excellent color scheme. The light gray may be a bit dull in vehicle
mode, but particularly in robot mode, the plethora of other colors really
makes the toy stand out. I mean, Springer has got a TON of paint apps all
over the place-- light green, black, and light gray make for a nice color
scheme-- and all of his secondary colors fit in perfectly with their surrounding
primary colors. The gold goes incredibly well with the light green, and
the dark bluish-green and light green also make for killer complimentary
colors. Adding in a bit of silver, blue, and red to round things out really
completes the toy. The only quibble I have-- an incredibly small one--
is that the missile pods visible when you open up front of his vehicle
mode aren't painted. But that's easily overlooked, given all his other
sweet, sweet paint apps.

     Botcon Springer is a
fantastic homage on a great mold, with the sheer variety of colors and
paint apps on him being one of the biggest draws to the toy, even ignoring
the homage. Highly recommended, if you can afford him.

       Springer spent much of the war with
the Decepticons going it alone, making friends along the way, but never
staying in one place for any extended period of time. As word of the defeat
of the Decepticons on Klo made its way throughout the galaxy, Springer
was a bit disappointed when he thought that there would no longer be a
war to fight. When he was approached by Grimlock to join the crew he was
leading to hunt down Bludgeon and his army, Springer jumped at the opportunity.
Serving as Grimlock's Security Chief, Springer is one Autobot that the
Decepticons usually think twice about crossing.
