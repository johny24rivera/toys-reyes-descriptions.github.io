    Ratchet's vehicle mode
as an Activator is pretty darn good, all things considered. There's no
robot mode extras whatsoever, and there's a fair amount of paint detailing
on the toy-- particularly on the front area, the windows, and the rims,
which are all painted very nicely. The "heartbeat" symbols are on the sides
of his vehicle mode, as you'd expect, though he doesn't have any paint
detailing on his back end or on his sirens. He's a tad long proportionally
when compared to his show model, but otherwise he looks great as far as
his overall shape goes. However, the hinge mechanism that's necessary for
his auto-transformation just sticks out very blatantly from the sides of
the vehicle, and are a bit of an eyesore. I'm not sure how they would have
gotten around something like this, but a downside it is nonetheless.

    To activate Ratchet's
auto-transformation, press down on the light red section of his ambulance
roof, and the all that's required is unfolding his arms and legs. Ratchet's
robot mode is also quite good for an Activator. It's fairly show-accurate,
though the chest/stomach area is a bit large proportionally, and his head
seems to "poke out" from the top. The main complaints I have about this
mode are the large section of roof sticking up above his head, which just
is so obviously kibble, and the fact that the flaps to the side of his
body don't peg into anything, so they can wiggle around atad, which is
annoying. His hands are also a little puny, but other than that he looks
pretty good. He can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows (at two points),
hips, and knees (at two points), and many of those are on ball joints,
so he's quite poseable. The detailing on his face, particularly at this
scale, is extraordinary-- all of the necessary details are there, and painted
in a very crisp manner on the toy. The arms and legs could really use some
paint detailing, however. Particularly his shoulder pads, which should
be white with the red "heartbeat" symbols on them (though at least they're
the proper "square" shape, unlike on the

    Activator Ratchet is
a nice toy in vehicle mode and pretty decent in robot mode as well, given
the size class and the auto-transform gimmick. I think deluxe class Ratchet
is still slightly better, but Activator Ratchet is a fine substitute if
you want a smaller version of the character, like auto-transformers, or
just really like Ratchet.

      Autobot Ratchet has been around long
enough to know that a wise robot always plans for the worst, and hopes
for the best. No situation is so bad that he can't make it seem a little
more gloomy. It's evidence of his extreme bravery that even when he sees
nothing but doom ahead, he keeps on working and fighting for victory.
