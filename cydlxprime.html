not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to deluxe Armada Optimus Prime.

     In one of the most bizarre
and non-sensical repaints Hasbro has done in recent years-- especially
of the non-exclusive variety-- the deluxe-sized version of Armada Optimus
Prime has been repainted into CYBERTRON Optimus Prime, with no real explanation
given for why he's suddenly back in his Armada form. Armada Prime's new
deco job is made to resemble the repaint of the Super-sized Cybertron Prime
mold, called Galaxy Force Optimus Prime. And, oddness of the reuse of the
mold aside, the color scheme is pulled off extremely well. The red used
for this toy is of a quite attractive, eye-catching color, and this is
one of the few times that bluish black on the legs, head, and lower arms
looks better than a plain black, as it both gives Prime a different look
while still retaining some of that "blue-ness" that has always been a staple
color of Prime's. The light gray is generally where it's always been on
the toy, but that doesn't mean it still isn't a good contrast color. This
version of Optimus Prime also has more paint apps than the previous versions
of this mold have had, which is appreciated considering that this is the
first time the mold's been released without its partner Minicon. The white
outline on the windows is a tad tacky, even if it does draw its placement
from the larger
     <a href="cygfprime.html">
      Galaxy Force Optimus Prime
     </a>
     toy. The blue paint apps on the shoulders, legs, and arms look the best,
in my opinion, and really blend in nicely with the surrounding colors.
The white apps on the shoulders also add a nice contrast to the figure,
as does the silver apps-- heck, all of the paint apps are excellently placed
and work very well with the figure. On some of the later-released versions
of this toy, the Cybertron planet symbols, painted in silver, have been
added to the top of the truck mode to spice things up even more.

     Although no mold changes
have been made to the core Optimus Prime toy, his Minicon has been removed
and instead replaced with a modified Cybertron Cyber Key with a painted-on
Autobot symbol and a Minicon port. This allows the Cyber Key to do the
work of a Minicon on the toy-- quite creative, really, but still a bit
of a cheapo way out considering the earlier Armada remolds in the line
got their gimmicks remolded to actually fit Cyber Keys. Also, some of the
earliest versions of this toy released has the same annoying backwards-arm
problem that
     <a href="biabmagnustread.html">
      Universe Ultra Magnus
     </a>
     had,
ugh. This has been fixed in all releases after the first few sightings,
however.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Deluxe Optimus Prime
is a great repaint of one of the best Armada molds-- however, this mold
has been used four times now, the repaint is pretty nonsensical, and he's
traded in his Minicon for a less-playable Cyber Key. Still, overall I'd
say he's the best paint job this mold has ever had, so if you don't own
any of this mold's previous versions, pick it up by all means, you won't
regret it.

       Fearless leader of the Autobots for
as long as most can remember, Optimus Prime is a wise commander, as well
as a fearsome warrior. Despite his power, he prefers to resolve conflicts
without violence, believing that even the most dedicated criminal can be
redeemed. Many unfortunate villains have mistaken his compassion for weakness,
and paid the price of evil at his mighty hands.
