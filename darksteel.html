    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the DotM deluxe Sideswipe
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the DotM deluxe

     It may not be immediately
obvious to those who aren't familiar with the character-- particularly
given the different name, different alt mode, and different personality
described in the bio-- but Darksteel here is actually an homage to Beast
Wars
     <a href="quickstrike.html">
      Quickstrike
     </a>
     ! (Why he isn't NAMED Quickstrike--
since there's nobody else in the movieverse already named that-- is anyone's
guess.) The colors are roughly reversed from BW Quickstrike's, however,
with a dark brownish black being the dominant color (particularly in vehicle
mode), and a dull (non-transparent) mustard yellow being a secondary color
mostly visible in robot mode. The mustard yellow looks surprisingly good
against the brownish black in this rather original scheme, and the latter
color itself looks a bit more metallic and interesting than a regular black.
Heck, in car mode, it looks very close to how an actual car's finish would
be, which is a big plus for me. The optics and car windows (i.e., "eyes"
in vehicle mode) are a translucent light red just like on Quickstrike,
and the really cool-looking curved metallic bluish green designs on the
vehicle mode look almost ripped from parts of Quickstrike as well. The
teal works quite well against the brownish black, though it looks particularly
good near the mustard yellow-- I wish there were more instances of those
two colors "colliding" on this toy. There's a couple of other incidental
colors that are mostly either there to blend in with the other plastic/paint
colors-- like the dull blue-green plastic and dull metallic gold paint
found on the robot chest-- that serve as nice additions, but don't add
anything to the color scheme themselves. There's also a tad of silver where
needed, on the front grill and wheel hubs.

     Darksteel has a new
head, loosely based on BW Quickstrike's. However, this one emphases the
wrong features of Quickstrike's head, making Darksteel look rather... well...
doofy. His head has overly large/round eyes, and together with the odd
"mustache"/painted fangs on his robot mouth, looks really odd, like he
has a goofy smile. The "cobra"-style head crest still looks great, but
since they were homaging Quickstrike I wish they would've gone for a straight-up
Quickstrike head, here-- it's not like his head would look out-of-place
on a movieverse toy. This other headsculpt doesn't quite cut it, and is
my biggest disappointment with this redeco homage. Darksteel also comes
with
     <a href="dotmstarscream.html">
      Starscream's
     </a>
     Mechtech weapon-- with
the claw on one of them painted red to look like Quickstrike's "tail stinger",
in a rather brilliant twist. This is especially cool given that in vehicle
mode, if you attach both weapons together, you can extend the weapons out
to look quite a bit like a "tail", ready to strike! Wonderful use of paint,
there.

     For the most part, Darksteel
is a pretty great and very unexpected homage. Not everything works (that
HEAD), but the nifty coloring and awesome use of Starscream's Mechtech
weapon as a "stinger" make it a cool redeco regardless of whether you like
Quickstrike or not. Unfortunately, the mold is only medicore, but if you're
a Quickstrike or Corvette Stingray fan, I'd still recommend it, even if
you already have this mold's previous "vanilla" release as Sideswipe.

       Darksteel is a traditionalist. As a
student of the most respected Decepticon warrior on Cybertron, he learned
there is no substitute for a razor-sharp blade and clever mind. Blasters
and cannons get the job done, but may fail in the heat of battle. The blade
never falters!
