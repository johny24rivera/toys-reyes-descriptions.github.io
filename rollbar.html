    Vehicle mode is a jeep.
This mode is rather boring, actually. There's very little to look at in
this mode- the yellow fade on the front and the silver mirror are the only
things that distract one from the boring dark army green and black that
are prevalent in this mode. Even adding the guns on the top of the jeep
add little. The seats are way too small to even allow Spychangers to sit
in them. To top it all off, the wheels and the mirror are the only parts
that move in this mode. What you're left with is a mode that does not catch
the eye at all. The Decepticon logo is also rather oddly placed- you think
it would be either in the middle of the backside or on the hood, but it's
on the left side of the backside, giving a badly asymmetrical look to that
part of the toy. At least there's no robot extras in this mode, though...

    Rollbar's robot mode
is actually worse than his vehicle mode. Although the orange chest takes
away from the boring color scheme a little, this mode just has very ugly
proportions. First off, Rollbar's head is teeny tiny when compared to his
body, especially his overly large and wide chest. His legs are also incredibly
short, with the robot FEET actually being larger and longer than them.
Rollbar's arms are also joined to his body not at the shoulders, where
they should be, but at the ELBOWS, and it gives a very odd look to this
mode if you don't have his arms positioned directly up and down. They also
don't quite slide out far enough to clear the jeep parts on the backside,
so you have the arms actually slant in a little from a directly-front on
view, which, again, looks bad. He also can only move at the shoulders (elbows?)
in this mode, at at the knees on each of his legs (although his legs can't
move individually, and the knees don't stay locked in any position except
straight down).

    Rollbar is just a rather
boring toy in jeep mode, and a just plain badly proportioned toy in robot
mode. If you're gonna get this guy, get him for the combining gimmick,
not for his indivdual modes, because they really aren't that good.
