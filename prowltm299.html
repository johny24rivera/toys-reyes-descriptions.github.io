    Beast mode is a transmetal
2 owl. This mode looks very nice, and has a better color scheme than the
original
    <a href="prowltm2.html">
     Transmetal 2 Prowl
    </a>
    , in my opinion.
In fact, the color scheme is so different, this could be considered a "dark"
clone of the original Prowl Transmetal 2. The detailing is awesome in this
mode, and there are a few neat features, especially on the head. The head
can rotate all the way around by pressing a button on Prowl's back, and
if you "unhook" the wings from their slots and lift them up, he can do
a "slicing attack" by having his wings rotate around his body! Another
neat feature is the transparent red half-orb on top of Prowl's beast head.
There are little pieces of shiny silver plastic crafted to look like "silicon
chips" inside! Flip the orb over to reveal the Maximal allegiance orb.
Yet another nice additon to this toy is the nice, transparent red right
eye that Prowl has, and the crafted plastic on the inside of the eye looks
very good, giving Prowl a "cyborg" look. The only major downside to this
mode is the very obvious robot arm extras between Prowl's two "rocket jet
packs" hanging from his waist. These tend to get in the way some and look
very odd. However, this is not enough to override the other neat features
this toy has.

    Robot mode is a bit
of a disappointment when compared to the beast mode, but still looks decent.
The detailing, excellent color scheme, and the see-through orbs, as well
as the robot mode face, are still very cool. The robot mode face has transparent
red plastic from the optics to the upper back of the head, and if you hold
his face up to light, it makes it appears as if his optics are "glowing".
The silver-painted "rune" on Prowl's forehead, which the original Prowl
Transmetal 2 did not have, adds to the "wise" look of this 'bot. One of
the eyes is circular, while the other is more in the shape of a human eye,
and this gives Prowl a bit of a "cyborg" look as well. There are a few
more downsides to this mode than there were in the last one, however. First,
the arms in this mode are very small when compared to other parts of Prowl's
body. Second, the robot chest (the owl head) sticks out a bit too far,
and the combination of the "rotating chest" (left over from the owl head)
and the two ears of the owl make his chest look very odd indeed. The last
problem is probably the most annoying one. Despite this being a repaint,
Hasbro still didn't fix the problem of the wings jiggling on Prowl shoulder's
when you move the Maximal. This is a little noisy and gets a bit annoying
after a while.

    A very nice transformer,
with a COOL color scheme. Recommended over the original Prowl Transmetal
2.

      Prowl strives to find logic and reason
in everything. A listener, not a talker. Has most sophisticated logic center
of the Maximals. Able to analyze and advise on complex combat situations
almost instantaneously. Fires highly corrosive acid pellets. Cybernetic
eye and frontal lobe interact with wing-mounted ion orbs, supplying limited
telekinetic power. Afflicted with ironic, dry sense of humor. Believes
himself to have been a great military strategist in a former life.
