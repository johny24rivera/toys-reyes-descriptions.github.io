    The new deluxe version
of Ratchet has a considerably more movie-accurate vehicle mode than the
    <a href="rotfratchetdlx.html">
     militarized
RotF version
    </a>
    . The proportions and detailing on his Hummer ambulance
mode are spot on, to the point where it's quite impressive at this scale
(Ratchet is a rather small deluxe). Treads on the tires, a shovel and other
rescue equipment molded onto the upper sides, handlebars for the doors--
it's all there. Another impressive feat is that, unlike many DotM toys,
Ratchet actually has all the paint apps he needs here! His new "updated"
deco is done to full effect here, with a big white stripe down the middle,
the large "FIRE RESCUE E4" writing on the sides, the little emergency stripes
above his front wheels, pretty much every headlight and taillight painted
(with the exception of those on the roof)-- heck, even the back end is
painted with the white stripe, along with the rear windows! Put all this
with the fact that Ratchet doesn't have any robot mode extras in this mode
(even through the transparent plastic you can't make out any obvious robot
parts), and beyond the small size there's not anything holding him back
in this mode. I did like his original movie color scheme a little better,
but this isn't much of a downgrade-- still a little bit ugly, honestly,
but realistic for an emergency vehicle. His Mechtech weapon is also a lot
of fun-- pull back on the miniature handle and a sawblade folds out, rotating
in place as it does so! Like all Mechtech weapons, it can't lock into place
in this mode, but it's so much fun to do over and over again I honestly
don't care. Ratchet's only visible Mechtech port is cleverly hidden in
the middle of his spare tire on the roof of the vehicle. You can also fold
back one panel on each side to reveal two more Mechtech ports for some
side-gun action, but this makes the feet a bit visible if you do so.

    Ratchet's robot mode
is the best out of any version released thus far, looking great proportionally
overall with only a few inaccuracies (such as some blatant roof kibble
on the back, which also extends back a bit far-- but at least it stays
out of the way of movement, and it's not heavy enough to really affect
his balance). The mold detailing is still fantastic here (particularly
on the legs and head), but Ratchet is missing a few paint apps on the legs
that he could really use, particularly some silver. His shoulder panels
and back panels also don't tab together anywhere or lock into place, but
you usually aren't putting much pressure on them (particularly on the shoulders),
so that's no big deal. His articulation is great-- he can move at the neck,
shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), slight back-and-forth
movement at the wrists, and movement at the hips (at two points, though
one is restricted), knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points).
He could've used some rotational movement at the knees, and longer heels
for more stability, but that's about it.

    The deluxe DotM Ratchet
mold is not only the best mold of the character, but one of the best molds
from the line, period. He looks great in pretty much every respect in both
modes, has great articulation, a really addicting Mechtech weapon, and
is just a fun figure with only a few very minor downsides. Highly recommended.

      Autobot Ratchet has dedicated his life
to healing the sick and repairing the wounded. Every weapon he has ever
carried has served a dual purpose as both a means of defense and a rescue
tool. Even as he battles the Decepticons, his mind works overtime to process
the most efficient means of saving his enemies' lives once the battle is
over.
