    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Ravage
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original RotF
Ravage toy

     Recon Ravage really should've
been named Re-entry Ravage. Although he still retains the dominant black
&amp; gray color scheme of his original version, there's some really nice
red fade paint apps on his shoulders and head. Combine this with his "red-hot"
spikes and it definitely looks like he's just finished re-entry. The chrome
silver is another nice touch-- you don't see chrome on toys that often
anymore, and fortunately, this chrome doesn't seem to have any tendency
to flake off. It helps to give Ravage another light contrast color against
the black, fits in with the couple of rather dull light gray plastic bits,
and given that it looks like highly-polished metal, is another nudge towards
Recon Ravage's "re-entry" color scheme. The regular, non-red-fade paint
apps are focused around his vertebrae, which is a pretty cool look. There's
also a bit of yellow highlights, which goes decently enough with the other
colors, but I'm glad it's just an accent color, as Ravage doesn't exactly
scream "yellow" to me. This whole color scheme has led a few people to
think that perhaps Recon Ravage may be a Voltron lion homage, but that's
merely speculation.

     Recon Ravage is a bit
prettier than his original version, mostly due to the chrome and neat paint
apps on his vertebrae, but I don't think he's quite as cool as this mold's
later repaints. Still, if you've bought enough N.E.S.T. Global Alliance
toys, he's only $5 U.S.-- why the heck not?

       Light slides off Ravage the way a duck's
feathers shed water. Even in the brightest light, he is nothing more than
a shadow, slinking unnoticed towards his prey. He is the ultimate infiltrator,
absolutely silent, endlessly patient, but savage and lethal when the mission
calls for it. No creature in the galaxy is better suited to be a thief
and spy, which is just fine with Ravage. He takes delight in working in
the darkness for the glory of Megatron.

       *In the U.S., Recon Ravage was not available at retail-- instead, you
mailed in 5 proof-of-purchase N.E.S.T. Global Alliance stickers along with
the form you got from the
       <a href="rotfnestpack.html">
        N.E.S.T. Vs. Pack
       </a>
       ,
along with $5 for shipping, and he came to you in the mail. In Canada,
he was simply a Toys "R" Us exclusive.
