    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Cybertron
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Galaxy Force Optimus
Prime is one of the least-changed repaints in the Cybertron line, and that's
not a good thing considering how expensive of a toy he is. The major change
that has been made when compared to the original version is that the dark
blue and some of the light gray have been replaced with a charcoal black.
There are some other, more minor changes when it comes to plastic color,
such as the fact that the hand-held rifle and part of each of the larger
guns is now red, but that's not nearly enough to justify a repaint of the
toy, in my opinion. The light gray is still pretty much the exact same
color that it was on the original Cybertron Prime, and the red is only
the slightest shade darker. I understand that the people in charge of the
repaint wanted it to continue to look like Prime, but the same "Prime-y"
colors could still have been used while keeping this repaint substantially
different, like, say, swapping around the red and black colors or something
like that. Most of the other changes from the original Prime are more minor,
and have to deal with some of the paint apps-- the orange paint on the
kneecaps has been changed to a very shiny metallic blue, for one, and the
paint on the sides of the two big guns have been changed to the same metallic
blue and a very attractive shade of metallic bronze. That color combo looks
better there than it did on the original Cybertron Prime, I think. The
knee-guns have been changed in color to red, and now have a nice-looking
bronze paint app accenting them. Instead of Autobot symbols on his shoulders,
Optimus now has symbols for each of the four main planets in the Cybertron
line, two on each shoulder, to symbolize the unification of the Transformers
race at the end of the cartoon. Very cool-looking, and a nice "finality"
toy-wise to the Armada-Energon-Cybertron continuity, since there's no more
Autobots and Decepticons, just Transformers. His Cyber Key is also FINALLY
painted, with a nice metallic gold border and a chrome gold Autobot symbol.
All of Galaxy Force Prime's changes aren't sunshine and lollipops, however.
For one, the replacing of the light gray AND the dark blue on the arms
with solid charcoal black lessens the variety of colors a bit, and no extra
paint apps have been added in those areas to spice things up any. There's
also been a few paint apps removed from around Prime's mouth, and he really
needs those paint apps there to distinguish his features, especially now
that they're black. The chest also looks more plain, since a few paint
apps have been taken away from there as well.

Prime is a very good-looking repaint when taking by itself, but it's far
too similar to the original Cybertron Optimus Prime to justify spending
$40 on the toy again, unless you're an Optimus Prime completist. More effort
really should have been put into a repaint of a toy this large, especially
one that isn't a store exclusive.

       With the rediscovery of the lost colony
worlds and the reunification of the Transformers race after millions of
years, Optimus Prime has become the leader of far more people than he ever
could have imagined. Cybertron Primus has been reactivated, the Planet
Keys returned to their rightful place on Cybertron, and Galvatron and his
Decepticons all but defeated. It is time, he thinks, for a new golden era
of peace in the galaxy, and he has ordered the construction of a fleet
of starships so that the Autobots might explore the galaxy around them,
bringing peace and justice wherever they go. While many of the Autobot
soldiers who fought with him are choosing to remove their weapons systems
now that the war is over, Optimus Prime has decided to keep his, not because
he hopes war will once again come, but as a reminder of what once was.
He hopes to serve as a reminder to all those who would bring violence and
tyranny to the universe that there are mighty warriors who will stand against
them always.
