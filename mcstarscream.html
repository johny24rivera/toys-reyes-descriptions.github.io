    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
jet. This mode is one of the doofiest-looking vehicle modes I've ever seen,
and is WAY too kiddy, even for a Happy Meal toy. I mean, just look at this
thing- it's far too... "chubby"... to be a plane, and looks like it has
pontoons on the bottom. The proportions are just completely out of whack.
The paint detailing is nice, though (for once). Starscream has two Minicon
ports on the bottom rear of this mode, about half an inch apart. He also
has three Decepticon symbols; one on each wing, and one on the center top
of the airplane. Starscream's gimmick is pretty cool, though- pull back
on it and let it go on a flat surface, and it'll roll forward, spin, flip,
and transform, all in one smooth motion! Very neat!

    Too bad the robot mode
is a big plastic brick, though. Although the proportions aren't too bad,
he's basically just all molded onto two pieces of plastic- only his head
can move in this mode, and that's it! Which pretty much limits him to just
standing there and looking at you. Oh, yeah, and he has clown feet.

    Starscream has a really
cool gimmick, one that I hope is used eventually on larger, "official"
toys. That's pretty much all the good I can say about this toy, though.
