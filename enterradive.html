    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Sky Shadow. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Sky Shadow

     Terradive is a fantastic
repaint of Sky Shadow all-around. The white-and-blue color goes great with
a plane, and it's certainly fitting, too. The blue and white are pretty
pure colors, and coupled with the nice light milky blue, give Terradive
a calmer look than his partner Sky Shadow. The gold and black serve as
good contrasts to the other colors, and actually help to give Terradive
a bit of a royal look-- not to mention having gold wings and turbines is
just plain cool. He also has a few other colors to help even things out,
like silver and orange, that are used in just one place (the chest). And
he's got a good amount of paint apps on him, with many of them in different
places than on Sky Shadow, so it doesn't have the lazy look of a repaint
that's just a straight pallet switch. And some of the paint apps are actually
in better places-- for example, I still don't like the look of Terradive's
face, but he doesn't have those weird paint apps around his mouth like
Sky Shadow did, so no goofy "mustache" here.

     No mold changes have
been made to Terradive, but he does have two added blue Powerlinx symbols,
one on each wing-- the earlier versions of Sky Shadow didn't have these
symbols.

     Terradive has one of
the best decos in the Energon line, and he's already a pretty good mold
anyways. Recommended over Sky Shadow if you only want one version of the
mold-- this version's about as good as it's going to get, folks.
