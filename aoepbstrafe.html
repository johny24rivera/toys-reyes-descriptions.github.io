    Strafe's two-headed pterodactyl
monster mode makes the transition to Power Battler form a little oddly.
He really, REALLY looks like his robot mode with shorter legs and two pterodactyl
heads coming out of the shoulders-- which, given the simplified nature
of this subline is of course exactly what it is. However, he can't take
a more natural pterodactyl-like "stance", with his heads pointing forward/upward
and his wings and legs lined up accordingly, due to his gimmick (explained
later). This means he's forced to look like an odd little short-legged,
two-headed winged thing with an obvious back of a skull in between the
shoulder blades and claw-hands that are very obviously robot-proportioned.
The lower robot legs also stick out rather obviously from behind Strafe's
main body, though the way the wings are positioned this is hidden from
most angles. I do like how they try to hide the shortened legs at least
a little bit with the nice long 'dactyl claws. His wingspread is quite
impressive, and the mold detailing on him is also great; he's got armor-like
detailing all over from his arms to his segmented tail to the "sharp bits"
on the fronts of the wings (made out of rubbery plastic; all of the pale
grayish blue plastic is rubbery on this toy), with it getting a bit more
intricate on his main body. The two pterodactyl heads are a bit two-dimensional,
however, being too skinny looking at them from a head-on angle-- likely
done so they can collapse against Strafe's chest better in robot mode.
The color scheme is also pretty good, even if it's not movie-accurate--
the dark blue and black looks fairly nice overall, and the wicked-looking
jagged black stripes on the blue wings look particularly nice. The silver
on the beaks and chest is also a nice shade of the color, and greenish
blue on the slitted optics on the two heads contrasts against the black
well, too. His lower body is actually painted a metallic shade of the blue
that's Strafe's main color, and it's a rather eye-catching shade. The only
thing I'm not fond of regarding Strafe's coloration and number of paint
apps is the pale grayish blue rubbery bits used for safety purposes on
his tails and outer wings. It's not the rubbery-ness of them that I mind;
I understand that that's required. Rather, it's a rather boring color that
isn't in the right places to be used as a good contrast against Strafe's
otherwise dark color scheme, and given the lack of paint on it due to its
rubbery-ness, looks even more boring when it's used on large swaths like
on the lower wings. It just doesn't look quite right. For articulation
in this mode, Strafe can move at each neck (at three points), each jaw,
the shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), at the mid-section
on each wing, at the base of his two tails (as one piece) and up-and-down
at each ankle. (Sadly due to his transformation, there's no hip movement.)
Thus he's fairly articulated for a Power Battler, particularly for a beast
mode.

    Strafe's robot mode
isn't much of a surprise, given how incredibly obvious it's going to look
from his beast mode-- as mentioned earlier, it's essentially his beast
mode with longer legs, the pterodactyl heads folded in at the shoulders,
and the robot head folded up. Thus pretty much all of his coloration, detailing,
and general look carry over from one mode to the next. The only real additions
as far as the aesthetic goes are the long-toed "knight shoes" on the longer
legs and the rather nifty head, which looks like a knight mask with a pterodactyl
crest on top-- a nice "fusion" of the knight and beast aesthetics, there.
Proportionally he's pretty good, but again, he's just so...

    when compared to his beast mode. The pterodactyl heads look nice framing
his armored, segmented chest, though I wish they could fold up a little
more, given how long each head is. The wings are folded in a bit for this
mode, and they look rather odd this way, what with the darker blue portion
of the wings still sticking out a bit and then ending abruptly at right
angles. He's still got some pretty big wings overall hanging off his lower
arms in this mode though, and this is for his "Spin Attack" gimmick-- if
you undo the peg piece that holds his waist in place at the back, you can
twirl Strafe around freely at the waist-- ideally with his arms upward
and splayed out so his wings can "cut up" enemies. (You can also do this
in beast mode, but it's more difficult due to the robot legs being curled
up-- there's more restrictions on how he can spin freely.) It's one of
the weaker gimmicks from the Power Battler line, particularly since it's
honestly just a loose waist for a gimmick. I'm VERY thankful that there's
that little peg piece back there to keep his waist secure so he isn't constantly
twirling around at the waist. For articulation in this mode, Strafe has
the same movement at the arms as in beast mode, as well as back-and-forth
movement at the knees and movement at the base of his two tails-- thus
he's actually LESS articulated in this mode. I really wish he had some
hip movement...

    Honestly, unless you're
a completist there's no reason to get Power Battler Strafe. The deluxe
version already has a pretty easy transformation if that's what you're
worried about, and said deluxe also has more articulation with better proportions
in beast mode and wings that aren't so odd-looking in robot mode. This
toy isn't super-bad by any means, but this is one toy that honestly doesn't
have any reason for existing beyond simply filling out the ranks in a subline.
