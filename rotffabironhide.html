    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cannon Blast Ironhide.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cannon Blast Ironhide

     Ironhide's new deco takes
on a more "G1-y" feel, but it's not just red. He's also got a substantial
amount of charcoal gray on him in addition, which really helps to break
up the toy and keep it from being just a red-and-some-black scheme. However,
that's not all; Cannon Force Ironhide also has a pretty neat symbol on
his hood-- an Autobot symbol with a sword through it and feathers on the
side, inside a black triangle. It's a pretty darned cool emblem, nad definitely
gives his vehicle mode a bit more of a military feel even if it's hardly
a military vehicle. The metallic bronze used for his windows is also a
very nice, attractive shade and matches well with the red. And as if THIS
all wasn't enough, he's got some nice "mud splatter" brown paint masks
down the side of his vehicle mode. A dull, one-color toy this guy ain't.
Finally, he's additionally got some nice fade patterns on some of his robot
parts, such as some bronze on the sides of his head and some silver fade
on his legs to make him look a bit "battle-tested" and "worn". The only
thing I'm not fond of regarding his color scheme is his sky-blue missile--
it just doesn't fit with the rest of him.

     Cannon Force Ironhide
isn't just a slavish G1 redeco "for the sake of it", but rather has quite
a few other colors-- and some nice paint apps, such as his "mud spray"
and the emblem on his roof-- that make him worth a second glance if you're
looking to get an Ironhide toy for a youngin' and don't particularly care
about movie color accuracy. I'd definitely recommend it over his traditional
color scheme, not because it's G1, but because's there's a lot of paint
apps on there and it's just well-done. Unfortunately, the mold itself makes
it a difficult recommendation for anyone who isn't so young they still
have difficulty transforming "mainline" TFs.
