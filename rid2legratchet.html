    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Strongarm toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 legion Strongarm

     Ratchet is a redeco and
SLIGHT remold of the Legion Strongarm figure, and as far as the colors
go, it's pretty spot-on Ratchet. He's mostly white plastic, with some black
on the wheels, windows, knees, and a bit on the shoulders. Of course those
two colors by themselves would make for a pretty boring color scheme, so
in his usual Autobot-y manner he's got a decent amount of red too-- dark
red, in this instance. It frames most of the bottom of his vehicle mode
(car doors excluded), along with some on the middle of his front hood and
on his lower legs in robot mode. All of the three major colors are spread
throughout Ratchet pretty well and keep him from being too one-tone in
any one area of the toy. There's also some dull orangish yellow on the
headlights, which was a nice choice, since a lighter yellow wouldn't have
stood out enough against the white. I think it's really unfortunate that
the vehicle mode hasn't been changed at all mold-wise from Strongarm, however,
as Ratchet is an ambulance, not a police SUV! He has the
     <i>
      wrong vehicle
mode
     </i>
     on this version. For cryin' out loud, Hasbro...

     The remolded part of
Ratchet is the chest/main body section, which also includes the head. Of
course Ratchet's head has been remolded to fit in with
     <a href="priratchet.html">
      Prime
Ratchet's
     </a>
     general look, with a skinny red head crest, a silver face,
and blue eyes. There's also a bit of black on the chest that's meant to
be faux windows lined up similar to how they were on the Prime Ratchet
toys, but there's a problem with that, too-- this isn't how Ratchet's chest
looks in the RID2015 show! He has a single longer black window for his
chest on the show, so that's another oversight as well, even on the one
remold they DID do to the toy. Meh.

     RID2015 legion Ratchet
has a decent color scheme that's "spread around" the mold quite well, but
as a representation of this design of Ratchet it falls a bit flat. The
vehicle hasn't even been retooled into an ambulance so he has the wrong
vehicle mode, and the chest details in robot mode are also incorrect. It's
a decent toy, but not a decent Ratchet-- get either of his other RID2015
toys instead.
