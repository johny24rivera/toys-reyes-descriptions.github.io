    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM Activator
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM Activator Bumblebee toy

     "Recon" Bumblebee is
the only Activator repaint for this small DotM subline, and like most movie
Bumblebee redecos, the main colors are inverted-- that is, black is the
main color, with an orangish-yellow serving as a secondary color. Paint-app
wise, however, it's not simply a color switch-- he's got different paint
apps too, particularly in vehicle mode. He's got one sole wide yellow stripe
down the top of his vehicle mode compared to the "conventional" two, and
diagonal yellow paint apps near his rear vehicle bumper. The orangish-yellow
paint used is a bit TOO same-ish compared to most other Movie Bumblebee
toys, however, and although certainly not bad, a brighter yellow would've
worked better as a main contrast color, methinks. The black itself is a
rather "impure" charcoal black that often has a weird tinge of green to
it. Again, a more "straight" black would've worked better, but it still
looks pretty nice. Although I love the half black/half yellow Autobot symbol
paint app along one of his stripes in vehicle mode, he's missing some paint
apps that I consider essential, like headlight and taillight paint. (His
windows get a pass since they can believably be black on a black car.)
In robot mode, he gets a few more colors, with some nice silver accents
along his legs and waist. His electric blue eyes and "transformation activation
trigger" look very good against the black, too-- at least when it comes
to paint, I don't have any complaints about how his robot mode deco is
laid out, it looks fairly eye-catching.

     The Activator "Recon"
Bumblebee toy is your typical "color inversion" Bumblebee redeco, but it's
a nifty-- if unoriginal-- paint scheme, with a few nice little differences
with this version such as the half-yellow/half-black Autobot symbol on
his front hood. I do wish his yellow and black paint/plastic was a bit
more "pure" though, for a cleaner look. Since this is an Activator, the
audience for this toy is definitely limited, but I think LOOKS-wise, this
is the best toy in the subline. If you've got a young 'un who wants a Bumblebee
toy but not in the "same old yellow", this is something to consider; otherwise,
pass unless you're a completist.

       Bumblebee is one of the most skilled
Autobot warriors. Hes challenged some of the biggest, most villainous
Decepticons and emerged victorious. His bravery and valor are matched only
by his obsession with his vehicle mode  just a scratch to his paint by
a Decepticon is enough to spark an all-out battle!
