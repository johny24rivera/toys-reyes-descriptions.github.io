    Vehicle mode is a missile
truck. This mode is pretty nice all around, and the color scheme is EXACTLY
like it is on the "traditional"

    toy. Thus, there is no question that this "Scourge" and the large trailer
truck "Scourge" are both the same guy. And, of course, just like on the
last Scourge, the color scheme rocks- black, teal, gray, and red go together
SO well. As for Scourge's gimmick- place on of his missiles on his missile
launcher, then pump the bellows- HARD, if you want it to go anywhere. If
you do succeed, though, the missile will fire a good ten feet. You have
to push so hard, though, that you might end up banging the rest of the
toy harder than you intend- not to mention the air bellows comes off a
bit easier than I'd like in this mode. The darn missiles also just... don't...
want.. to stay... ON. Grrr, that gets SO annoying after a while. At least
the gun looks good without the missiles on it, though.

    Scourge's robot mode
KICKS. Practically everything about it is awesome- ESPECIALLY the light
piping in the face, which makes him look SO eeeevil and ready to kick some
Autobot butt. That missile launcher on his right arm also works wonders
for the look, too. One MAJOR problem- though, and it's with that darn air-pressurized
missile gimmick again. It's nigh-impossible to get the bellows and the
missles to stay on his back in this mode, and his air hose is far too short
to allow so decent posing out of his right arm. The solution? Just clip
the darn air hose off, and put the missiles away somewhere. Then you have
a nigh-perfect transformer. In fact, the only other problem I have with
this mode at all is a rather minor one- he has no heels, but his legs are
solid enough to still keep himi pretty stable. The fists on mine also collapse
into the arms rather easily, but this doesn't seem to be that common of
a problem. Scourge's articulation is also awesome- he has knee, waist,
hip, head, shoulder (at two points), and elbow (at two points) articulation.
This, balanced with his overall good structure and proportions, allows
you to put him in all manner of poses- provided you clip that darn air
hose off.

    Scourge is an awesome
toy, make no mistake. But I've never seen a more obtrusive gimmick on any
Transformer in my life. Trust me, even though it'll lower the value of
your toy, clip the air hose off when you get him and throw the missiles
away. Then you'll have no more worries, and one of the best Transformers
from the RiD line.
