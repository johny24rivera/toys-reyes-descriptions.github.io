    Beast mode is a metallic
mutated velociraptor skeleton. This mode looks creepy and very evil. His
tail can swing back and forth by moving a lever back and forth on his rear
area. His legs look great and arent oddly placed like the

    , although they are a little skinny and don't support the
beast mode too well. The only major complaint I have is his arms look odd
because they are his legs in his robot mode. They also cant close together
very well. He has a great pouncing position, though. His Transmetal 2 orb
is under his forehead plate.

    Robot mode looks very
evil, also. He has some wires on his arms and legs, which get in the way
a little, but look nice. His claws are odd looking, but very fierce and
large. His face has a nice mutated look to it, with one of his eyes being
a circular laser generator. His shoulder armor does stick out a bit, but
can fold easily. His back plates can come loose a little easily. His arms
are a little longer in proportion to his body than his legs, but they look
nice this way.

    A very nice robot; highly
recommended if you like Predacons.
