    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Saesee Tiin

     Like just about every
other Jedi out there, Ahsoka Tano has gotten a SWTF toy of her in the Jedi
Starfighter mold. The color scheme for the most part is pretty standard
fare for Star Wars Transformers-- mostly off-white with some dark maroon
and gray. What makes Ahsoka pop a little are the yellowish-green circuitry
lines going along parts of her starfighter, as they're interesting designs
and do an interesting job of mimicking the tattoos on her head. The yellow-ish
green goe swell against the dark maroon, which is where it's used most,
but unfortunately it's hard to see against the off-white. Visible in mech
mode, the dull pumpkin orange that's supposed to simulate her "skin" on
her face and arms also goes quite well with her other colors, to the point
where I really wish it was used more.

     Ahsoka Tano's headsculpt
is new, and does a pretty good job of pulling off the look of the character
while still keeping it rather robotic-looking, what with the nicely-detailed
circuitry lines on her face and whatnot. I will say that the proportions
of this mold look a bit too broad-shoulders to work all that well for a
female, though.

     SWTF Ahsoka Tano probably
has some draw for those who are fans of her character from the Clone Wars
cartoon, but overall she's just a mediocre mold with a generally uninspiring
paint job ("circuitry lines" excepted). Plus her mold doesn't fit a female
very well, and it looks quite similar to another repaint of this mold,
     <a href="kitfisto.html">

     . So generally a ho-hum release for
people who aren't particular fans of this alien Jedi.

       Ahsoka Tano pilots a starfighter on
a secret mission during the Clone Wars. The young Padawan arrives at a
remote planet where a droid factory is building hundreds of new battle
droids. Ahsoka changes her starfighter into a powerful mech that demolishes
the factory and the droids.
