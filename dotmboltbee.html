    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RotF Legends class Bumblebee

     "Bolt" Bumblebee is another
of those "barely-repaint" repaints of the toy. His basic color scheme of
yellow and black stays the same on this toy and in the same places, so
there's no real changes there. His windows are a bit darker than on most
versions of this mold, and he's got a few darker gunmetal gray paint apps
on his robot mode face and legs, but the major change here is the addition
of the "lightning bolt" decals on Bumblebee's front and sides, at the cost
of his stripes (his front grill details are still painted a gunmetal gray,
though). These lightning bolts form a pretty cool pattern, particularly
with the thin lines of silver strewn throughout the black bolts-- the silver
lines are also present on the big Autobot symbol on his hood, as well.
That said, I don't think they're all that better than Bumblebee's usual
stripes, just a little different.

     Bumblebee's right hand
has been remolded to be able to hold Cyberverse-scaled weapons; otherwise,
no mold changes have been made to this version.

     Bolt Bumblebee, taken
by itself, is a pretty decent Legends figure, and the "bolt" paint apps
are fairly nice. That said, the rationale for this release puzzles me--
it's of a mold that's been repainted (and in similar colors) several times
already; it's not part of a store-exclusive multi-pack where presumably
having a Bumblebee in the pack was a part of the deal; it's done on the
inferior (and, as of this movie, now inaccurate) version of the Legion
class Bumblebee mold; and it was released at the same time as the
     <a href="dotmcybumblebee.html">
      "normal"
DotM Legion class Bumblebee
     </a>
     (it was technically part of wave 2 of the
size class, but both waves were released at the same time). It's just pointless,
and there's many other versions of the character at this size class that
I'd recommend over this one.
