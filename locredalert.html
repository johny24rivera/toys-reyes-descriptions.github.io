     Instead of being based
on the deluxe "original"
     <a href="cyredalert.html">
      Cybertron Red Alert
     </a>
     toy, which would admittedly be pretty hard to duplicate at this scale,
the Legends of Cybertron version is based on Cybertron Defense Red Alert.
In vehicle mode, it's a fair representation of the larger toy, wich one
major exception-- there's a HUGE gap in the center of the vehicle mode
under the blaster, and no real attempt is made to cover it up. I mean,
when you can see Red Alert's entire upper body by looking at his vehicle
mode, that's one HECK of an extra. That major bit aside, though, it's a
nice-looking vehicle for being so far, with plenty of mold detailing and
a fair bit of paint detailing. The proportions are roughly spot on, though
the blaster isn't as big as on the larger version. Speaking of said blaster,
I'm not sure why it's molded into the "Cyber-Key activated" position on
this toy, that was kind of an odd choice. The blaster is also off-center
in this mode, as I guess enabling the blaster to slide from the center
to one side during the transformation like on the larger toy wasn't doable
with the budget for this tiny toy. I do like that the Cybertron Defense
Team symbol is still kept on Red Alert, though, instead of just a generic
Autobot symbol.

     Man, Red Alert's robot
mode is a bit of a turd, though. The lower legs are way too big and bulky
compared to the upper legs, and without knee articulation this emphasizes
that more. The arms are almost non-existant, just being sides of the vehicle
mode with barely-visible fists molded on the insides of the pieces. The
pieces are way too bulky for arms, and just look ridiculous. There's also
too big of a hollow space between the back of Red Alert's head and the
piece that makes up the rear end of the vehicle mode. His articulation
is rather limited even for a Legends of Cybertron toy, as well-- he can
move back-and forth at the shoulders and his hips are on ball joints, but
that's it. On the plus side, though, the purplish shade of blue used for
the upper legs, chest, and head looks really nice.

     Red Alert is definitely
the worst of the Legends of Cybertron molds, with a badly proportioned,
awkward robot mode and a huge unsightly gap in his vehicle mode. You're
much better off saving up and buying the larger Cybertron Defense Red Alert
instead, it's a MUCH better toy.
