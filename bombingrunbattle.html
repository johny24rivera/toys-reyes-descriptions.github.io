       Although still named
Grindor, this redeco seems to be a bit of a loose homage to G1 Sandstorm.
The tan and orange, despite being fairly similar colors, go together surprisingly
well. What really makes the color scheme, however, is the contrast of those
colors wit the dark bluish dray and, in robot mode, the metallic blue.
Both help give the color scheme a bit of "dark" in it, and particularly
the blue in robot mode goes quite well with the tan and orange. I have
to admit that this color scheme, as light as it is, doesn't tend to go
well with Grindor's rather demonic-looking face., however The nice brownish
"camo deco" on the sides of the 'copter mode is a nice touch, and helps
to differentiate this redeco from other versions of the mold-- though I
wish it was used a bit more, like on the top of the vehicle mode.

          For all of the repaints
Bumblebee has gotten lately, most of them tend to be "themed"; sand-weathered,
stealth camo, rally car, etcetera. This repaint, on the other hand, kinda...
defies explanation. The most obvious difference between this toy and the
original Cannon Bumblebee mold is that a lot of the black trim and plastic
has been replaced by a dark bluish-green. That theme carries over to the
windows, which are roughly the same color, only translucent and with a
bit more emphasis on the blue. The yellow and gray plastic used is maybe
a SHADE duller (and in my opinion, not quite as good-looking), but there's
barely any difference in that respect. His general deco job-- like his
car paint apps, his face, and the like-- remain the same in this release.
There's a few new irregular paint apps along some of his robot parts in
that bluish green color, but what exactly they're supposed to be eludes
me. Is this Swamp Moss Bumblebee? Drainage Ditch Bumblebee? I have no idea,
and the bio doesn't really help in that respect either. Granted, the bluish
green contrasts fairly well with the yellow and black, so I don't really
have any COMPLAINTS about the color scheme, other than that it's kinda
weird.

            In the unlikely event
that you're reading this, want this set, and don't have a deluxe movie
Bumblebee mold, the Bombing Run Battle Vs. Pack gets a recommendation,
despite the obvious huge size discrepancy between the two toys. Grindor
has a nice homage deco that's still original enough to stand out. I wish
I could say the same about the larger toy in the set, who is just another
slight redeco of Bumblebee's same ol' color scheme-- though it's by no
means a bad color scheme. If you have the Bumblebee mold, though, than
this isn't really an easy purchase even for Movie mold fans, given that
the only toy that's likely to get your attention and/or want is the tiny
one in the 2-pack.

              Bumblebee has been fighting airborne
Decepticons for ages, so he knows just how to deal with them. Grindor may
be able to hover well out of range of his weapons, dropping bombs with
chaotic glee, but the Autobot warrior still has a few tricks. He weaves
through the streets at top speed, forcing the Decepticon to maneuver constantly
between buildings. Eventually Grindor will make a mistake. As soon as his
rotor brushes a building, he'll come crashing down, and then Bumblebee
will have him.
