    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Mirage. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Mirage

     Fracture here is an homage
to Crasher, a female Go-Bot from the 1980s series. Many molds originally
intended to be male tend not to pass themselves off very well as females,
but the Classics Mirage mold here really works. The mold always had a rather
androgynous feel to it, and even without the pink face (which honestly
feels a little forced to me), Fracture can easily pass as a fembot. The
overall color scheme is very simple and not particularly original-- black,
white, and red-- but all three colors go incredibly well together, particularly
with the more vibrant shade of red that's visible in the robot mode. The
stripes going down the top of the vehicle mode look particularly dynamic,
as well, and the sheer number of paint apps Fracture has is very impressive.
If you don't like having large pieces of plastic on toys that are left
unpainted, well, you've got nothing to worry about here. The couple of
spots of silver also work as good acccent colors, as well.

     Fracture, homage or
not, is an absolutely fantastic recolor of one of the best Classics molds.
The only thing I don't like about her is the pink face, which seems a little
forced as if the only reason it's there is to say "Hey, it's a fembot!".
That small bit aside, though, otherwise the toy is very near perfect. Highly
recommended, and recommended even over Classics Mirage, to boot.

       Dedicated to Megatron and the Decepticon
cause, Decepticon Fracture is a dangerous enemy. She is totally fearless,
and probably a little bit crazy, as she dives directly into any battle,
regardless of the odds. Although she carries a powerful negative energy
blaster, she prefers to use the seismic energy dischargers on her feet
to smash the surrounding earth to pieces. Any battlefield on which she
walks shudders with the force of her steps.
