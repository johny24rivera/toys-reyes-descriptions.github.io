not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Alpha Bravo.

     Blades, true to his G1
form, has a color scheme that's very much your traditional Autobot colors--
mostly red and white, with some gray. The gray is, unfortunately, that
really blah milky shade, though thankfully it's only mostly used on his
upper arms and rotors. The red plastic itself more than offsets the gray,
being a rather pretty color that's swirly with some glitter, making it
look semi-metallic in shade. The white also looks great against both the
red and the black that's used in a few parts like Blades' hand/foot/gun
and regular weapon. The windows are also painted black, which again, looks
nice against the red. The most notable paint apps on Blades' form are the
"RESCUE" emblems on the sides of his 'copter mode and the nice white angled
stripe that run down the length of the sides, greatly increasing how good
he looks in chopper mode, with the white doing some much-needed breaking
up of all that red. There's also a nifty "Autobot Coastal Rescue" emblem
on the rear tailfins which looks similar to the U.S. Coast Guard symbol
with an Autobot symbol in it, which is a nice extra little touch. Getting
into robot mode, the white is more prominent on the body and upper legs,
and there's more silver paint-- in addition to that on the tail rotor and
on the side missiles, Blades' hands and parts of his chest and waist are
also painted silver. In a G1-accurate but still rather unique twist, Blades'
eyes are dark blue and his face a nice light metallic blue-- the only shades
of blue on the entire toy, which really complement the white and contrast
against the red nicely.

     Blades does have one
mold change when compared to Alpha Bravo, and that's a new head. His overall
head shape is still the same, but the forehead is more ridged, and he has
a more "normal" face compared with Alpha Bravo's visor and faceplate. It's
a pretty good sculpt overall, though his face looks a bit TOO neutral--
put some personality in there, Hasbro!

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Combiner Wars Blades
takes what could be a rather typical Autobot color scheme and spices it
up a bit with a really nice, semi-metallic shade of red, some interesting
white paint apps in vehicle mode, and some nice additions of silver and
blue in robot mode. He's neither my least favorite nor my favorite among
the many uses of this mold, but still works pretty well for what he is--
and hey, you need him to complete Defensor, don't ya?

       Blades can take his alternate form--
a chopper-- a little too literally. Sure, he carries plenty of firepower.
But he'd much rather shred enemies with his rotors, bringing them down
with a whirling flurry of copter kung fu.

        As unpredictable a warrior as you'll
find in the Autobot ranks. Most bots with flight capability tailor their
arsenal and fighting style to engage from distance. Blades prefers using
his photon blaster, wrist missiles, and helicopter blades up close and
personal. Dislikes the term "close quarters combat" as he claims, "it's
never really that close." Enjoys using evasive maneuvers to cause collisions
between multiple opponents-- claims there's "no such thing as fighting
dirty." Teammates give Blades a lot of room in a scrap, as his frenetic
style tends to leave a crater. With fellow Protectobots forms Defensor.

         Prior to joining the Protectobots, Blades
served as part of a Cybertronian security program in the city of Kaon,
famous for its underground gladiator contests. Blades honed his own fighting
skills during the apprehension of participants in these illegal duels.
Forms either an arm or a leg of Defensor, the combined form of the Protectobots.
