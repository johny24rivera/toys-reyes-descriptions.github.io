    Mold History
   </b>
   : Prowl's mold was originally
planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers: Generation 2,
but it never went through. His mold was finally released as Prowl 2 in
RiD, and now it's been repainted as G1 Prowl!

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Spychanger Prowl 2. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Spychanger Prowl 2

     Prowl has now been repainted
to resemble his G1 counterpart, although to tell the truth, it's still
not that different from the Prowl 2 version. (Though to be honest, there
aren't too many colors police cars come in, anyways.) His overall color
scheme- white, black, and blue- is still the same, albeit the blue is noticeably
darker. He doesn't have that annoying large Autobot symbol on his hood
anymore, so that's a definite plus. He's also got some pre-applied stickers
on him- a police "badge" on his hood, an Autobot symbol in the lower corner
of the hood, and "Highway Patrol POLICE" emblems on his car doors. They
look pretty nice, although on some toys it seems that they've been applied
in a bit of a crooked position. I wish they'd make his sirens and rear
headlights more of a solid red, though, since their pinkish tint looks
kinda silly. In robot mode, like the other G1 Spychangers, he bears no
resemblance to his G1 version. He still looks pretty nice, though- the
gray, silver, and blue really go well together.

     No mold changes have
been made to Prowl.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Prowl has a nice paint
job, but it's really not DIFFERENT enough from the previous version to
warrant purchasing unless you're a big fan of Spychangers. If you're looking
for just one version of the mold to buy, though, I'd recommend the Universe
Wal-Mart Exclusive version- it has the best overall color scheme, in my
opinion.

       Prowl is a strategic genius. His logic
center is the most sophisticated in the Autobot army, capable of analyzing
complex combat situations and making strategic decisions almost instantaneously.
Unexpected events, however, have been known to scramble his circuit. Launches
powerful wire-guided missiles and high corrosive-acid pellets.
