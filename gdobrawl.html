not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Breacher.

     An amphibious assault
vehicle gets redecoed as... Brawl? The tank Combaticon whose most noteworthy
bit is being part of a combiner? Well, there's a turret, so I suppose it's
not completely off-the-mark... Brawl's main color is-- as it usually is--
green, in this case a dull military green that's pretty much exactly the
right shade for a tank. He's also got a bit of black on his wheels and
double-barreled gun/turret, but in vehicle mode he largely is bereft of
paint apps (particularly on the rear two-thirds of the mode), making him
look pretty boring. They really should've taken advantage of all the mold
detailing on this toy and given him a few more paint apps here. (On a side
note, the "D67"s on the sides of this mode call back to Brawl's G1 Japanese
release number, D-67.)In robot mode, colors are mixed up considerably more,
with a rather interesting shade of purplish brown forming most of his "robot
bits". It's a nice color, but something that was a bit brighter would've
contrasted with all of his dark green (though yes, I realize that wouldn't
have been G1-accurate... but a lot about this toy isn't, anyways). He does
have a fair amount of gold and silver paint apps visible in this mode as
well, though, and where they're placed, at least they provide a bit more
contrast/visual interest here. (He definitely still needs some more paint
on his arms, though.) I find it rather distracting that Brawl wasn't remolded
with a more G1-esque head with a faceplate. By itself, the brick red mouth
and gold detailing on his purplish brown, two-eyed face looks pretty nice,
but it's not Brawl, not by a long shot.

     "GDO" Brawl is a waste
of an honestly great Scout mold. There were no shortage of
     <a href="focbrawl.html">
      Brawl
toys
     </a>
     that LOOKED like Brawl around the time this release came out,
and neither the vehicle mode nor the robot mode (especially the face) bring
Brawl to mind. He also (obviously) doesn't combine, kind of a major deal
for the character. His color scheme has a decent amount of contrast in
robot mode, but in vehicle mode he also looks pretty dull. If you want
this mold, get Breacher instead. If you want a Brawl, there's plenty of
other Generations options for you to consider over this one. Despite my
high rating (because of the mold) I'd only recommend this for people who
absolutely cannot get a Breacher for a reasonable price.

       Even other Decepticons are cautious
around Decepticon Brawl. The big 'bot has a hair-trigger temper. Anyone
who sets him off can be sure of one thing-- total destruction. His barely
contained rage is an asset in battle, but back at base it's just scary.
