    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titans Return Crashbash.

     "Overboard" is a copyright-friendly
(or possibly very cautious kid-friendly) new name for Overkill, who was
originally one of Soundwave's G1 cassettes that transformed into a tyrannosaurus,
and had a similiar color scheme to this toy. That said, Overkill was a
tape and a tyrannosaurus... turning him into a set where one of the accessory's
alt modes is a t-rex, the other is a pterodactyl-thing, and the core toy
is a Titan Master with a human head is deeefinitely a bit of a stretch
in terms of the concept. Like Overkill, Overboard's color scheme consists
almost entirely of two colors-- off-white and a dark, dull shade of navy
blue. Both colors are fairly solid in terms of contrasting against each
other, and it's a somewhat original scheme among Transformers. That said,
only the eyes are any other color (the t-rex head has yellow eyes, while
the pterodactyl-thing's head and the Titan Master's head mode have red
eyes). The dark blue and off-white are used on a few paint apps (for example,
the t-rex head is painted off-white), but those two colors are 99% it.
This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that they're mostly broken up pretty
well and this is a small toy, with only the t-rex chest/wing pieces being
too much of one color on one place, in my opinion. Still, just adding in
one major secondary color really would've helped Overboard look a bit more
attractive. The legs, aforementioned chest/wing pieces, and the Titan Master's
robot mode in general could particularly use another color/some more paint.
(The Titan Master's robot mode has NO paint on it whatsoever, which unfortunately
has become the norm in the Titans Return subline after the first wave.)

     No mold changes have
been made to Overboard; not even the head mode's face, which is normally
changed for Titans Return redecoes. Since Overboard/Overkill didn't have
a robot/human face, they've reused Crashbash/Squeezeplay's, which honestly
looks okay as the head of a (potential) t-rex-former, but I still would've
liked a new face.

     Titans Return Overboard/Overkill
is pretty much an afterthought for the line; one of those "well, we need
a redeco to fill a slot for this wave" ideas. The combined Titan Master/accessory's
t-rex mode is the only mode where this homage makes sense. In the other
modes, it bears no resemblance to G1 Overkill. The color scheme is fairly
nice, though a bit more paint/variety would've been appreciated. Recommended
only for Titans Return or "cassettebots/cons" completists.
