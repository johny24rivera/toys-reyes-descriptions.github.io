    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe TF1
'08 Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original TF1 deluxe '08 Bumblebee toy

     Alliance Bumblebee is
basically Bumblebee, now with more black stripes! (Really just a way to
keep him on the shelves while also keeping him "new".) Nothing's really
new about his color scheme-- it's still basically the same it's always
been. Compared to the
     <a href="rotfbumblebee.html">
      original RotF deluxe
     </a>
     version, most of the dark gray in robot mode has been replaced with a more
movie-accurate black, and the yellow is a bit more golden, both of which
make him look a little better. In vehicle mode, his two stripes now go
down the top of his roof too, and there are additional stripes (with the
N.E.S.T. Global Alliance logo) along his car doors. I quite like the stripes
on the top of the mode-- more contrast, and all that-- but the stripes
on the car doors look odd since they're ONLY on the car doors-- they really
should've stretched the side, from one wheel to the other. He doesn't have
any license plate paint apps (either in his car mode or on his crotch in
robot mode), and his rear tailpipes aren't painted, but other than that
the basic details are painted.

     Alliance Bumblebee has
the same head and arm mold changes that the original RotF deluxe version
has-- he has no mold changes unique to this release, though.

     Alliance Bumblebee is
a nice, somewhat movie-accurate version of the guy if you somehow managed
to miss the other versions of the mold, and has a few nice extras touches
to boot. It certainly helps that it IS a good mold, even if Bumblebee is
really starting to saturate the market. My personal favorite release of
the character in the RotF line, barely edging out the
     <a href="rotfhabumblebee.html">
      Human
Alliance
     </a>
     version due to value.

       When Bumblebee discovered Dirge lurking
as a sleeper agent among the N.E.S.T. Global Alliance air command, he partnered
with the first Autobot he could find. Now, he and Armorhide are tracking
the Decepticon flyer from airstrip to airstrip, hoping to catch him unaware
long enough to ground him permanently.
