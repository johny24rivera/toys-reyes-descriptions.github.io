    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Movie Landmine toy.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Movie Landmine
toy

     Although he's a repaint
of a previous toy that was a completely different character, Armorhide
here isn't just our typical name-reuse new repaint character-- from the
bio and his identical tech specs, he's meant to be an upgraded version
of the
     <a href="targetarmorhide.html">
      first Movie toy
     </a>
     of the same name.
Other than a somewhat similar color scheme, though, the two toys don't
really share anything in common. That's not to say that Armorhide isn't
a good repaint, though-- he's a lot darker-shaded of a military buggy than
Landmine was, his primary color in vehicle mode being a green so dark it's
nearly black. It looks pretty good against the light milky gray (though
said light gray itself is a bit boring of a color). There's a ton of silver
and gunmetal gray "military markings" on Armorhide's vehicle mode to keep
him from looking too dark-- stuff like "DEFENSE", "CMR", the N.E.S.T. Global
Alliance logos on his side doors, and the like. (There's also a "10-22-80"
logo above the windshield, which is obviously a date, but I have no idea
what it's referencing. A designer's birthdate, perhaps?) The robot mode
is really where the colors mix together well, however, as the lighter military
green-- nearly absent from the vehicle mode-- is quite evident and helps
the contast a lot. There's also some neat, small little red "highlight"
paint apps here and there, which really make the figure pop quite a bit
more than it otherwise would have. Heck, all the paint apps are particularly
well-placed to keep Armorhide from having any one section too dominated
by one color.

     RotF Armorhide is a
pretty nice repaint of a pretty nice mold, having pretty realistic colors
while not completely sacrificing an eye-catching color scheme (primarily
because of all the silver and red paint apps all over him). My favorite
version of this mold-- highly recommended.

       Things have been slow lately, so the
discovery of a Decepticon hiding right under his nose was like a dream
come true for Armorhide. He's enjoying working alongside Bumblebee, since
his damaged vocal processor means the other Autobot can't complain about
his methods. Armorhide doesn't care about stealth or safety. All he cares
about is bringing Dirge crashing down.
