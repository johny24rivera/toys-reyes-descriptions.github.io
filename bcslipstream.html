not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Prime First Edition Starscream.

     Although Slipstream made
her first appearance in Animated as a female Starscream clone, her first
actual toy is a redeco of
     <i>
      Prime
     </i>
     Starscream-- and believe it or not,
this is actually not a new character for the Prime universe, as she is
mentioned in some of the novels set before the Prime TV show. Regardless,
the rather skinny Prime Starscream design works remarkably well for a feminine
clone, and the color scheme is taken VERY closely from Animated Slipstream's
colors. That is, she's mostly a rather Decepticon-y, very eye-catching
shade of dark purple with metallic bluish green. (The bluish green plastic
and paint are both very close, with the plastic having a fair bit of glitter
in it to give it a fairly metallic look as well.) Both colors go VERY well
together, to the point where I'm surprised this general scheme isn't used
on more Decepticon TFs. There's also a fair amount of gray and black for
the colors to bounce off, and both are fairly neutral, straightforward
shades of the color that work nicely as either secondary colors (in the
case with the black) or only used on small connector pieces (as is the
case with the gray). As is the case with most Fun Publications' toys, Slipstream
has quite a good amount of paint. The dual metallic bluish green stripes
on her wings, cockpit, and chest look particularly good, but little extra
bits of that color on such things as the toys, shoulders, and rear wings
really make the scheme. The only issue I have in terms of the colors is
that, due to the mold breakup, Slipstream has a little big of each wing
cast in unpainted gray plastic, which doesn't sit well with how the rest
of the wing looks.

     One mold change has
been made to Slipstream, and that's a new head. As you'd expect from a
Starscream clone, it's quite similar to Prime Starscream's in its general
design-- being rather slim with a thin, long chin and similar eyes-- though
the little antennae that Prime Starscream has is absent here, with a bit
more mold detailing on the forehead and visible lips on her face. The black
head, silver face, and red eyes look quite good together.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     "Prime" Slipstream is
an excellent toy for the character-- not just for a Prime version, but
for her first toy in general. The mold works very well with her, and her
color scheme from Animated is applied nearly to a tee here. I would've
preferred her gray to be just a bit metallic, but that's being nitpicky.
Highly recommended if you're either a Slipstream or Animated fan and are
in the market for exclusive toys of this nature.

       Slipstream is a mystery to all those
whom she meets. No one knows who she is or from where she comes. All that
they know is that she seems a little different from the rest of the Cybertronians
who have made Axiom Nexus their home.

       This Decepticon poses as a spy for hire,
selling her skills to the top bidders from among the more nefarious members
of Axiom Nexus' criminal element. Her ability to cloak her energy signature
lends itself well to this line of work as, when enabled, it renders any
detector, alarm, and some Cybertronians, blind to her whereabouts. Even
the Transtech have not found a trustworthy means of tracking her. If cornered,
she can use her arm-mounted Alternating Gyro-Power (AGP) Nullifier missiles
to generate a cascading EMP shockwave capable of disrupting the energy
flow in machine, mech and robot for a half-hic. As crafty a schemer as
any Starscream, only she knows her true agenda as she stalks the darkest
alleys of Axiom Nexus.
