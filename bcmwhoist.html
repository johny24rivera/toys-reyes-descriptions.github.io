     Hoist follows his Machine
Wars version in looking vastly different from what you'd generally consider
to be Hoist, with his color scheme primarily black and dark fuchsia. On
the original MW toy, there was way too much black, though, which resulted
in a boring-looking toy; not so on this version. A lot of the fuchsia comes
out in robot mode, and it goes pretty darned well with the black (which
is a swirly, semi-metallic charcoal shade of the color; all things considered,
it looks a bit more like a black "finish" on a truck than regular black
plastic). It's also quite an original color scheme. To really make Hoist
pop, though, the Botcon folks extended the original MW toys' orange-and-red
striping across the entire sides of the toy and through the hood, dividing
it roughly into thirds. In robot mode, these orange-and-red paint apps
end up on the sides of the chest; combined with a similar paint app on
the center part of Hoist's waist, this rather ingeniously makes it look
like Hoist is wearing suspenders and a belt in robot mode, which is perfect
for his character. He's also got similar paint apps on his knee caps, to
give the legs some color. There's also some silver paint on the real windows
on the truck and the fake windows on Hoist's robot chest, both of which
look pretty good as an accent color against the other shades. (A slight
oddity is that Hoist's silver paint on his truck windows is on the INSIDE--
this actually fits with his original MW toy, though.) There's also some
silver on the backside of the headlights, a fuchsia front bumper, and some
red paint on the tailights. In fitting with the original toy's "Wilk and
Son Towing" emblem, Hoist has a curvy "W&amp;S Towing" emblem near the
back end of each side of the truck, and it looks pretty good.

     Hoist does have a new
headsculpt, though it's one of the weakest parts of this toy; the actual
details themselves are solid enough, but beyond a faceplate, the four little
dots on the forehead, and the little fuchsia stripe down the center, it
doesn't look like MW Hoist's head. No visor or rounded top. This facesculpt
was definitely made for his fellow Botcon exclusive Electro first. Additionally,
in an unfortunate assembly error, Hoist's shoulders are on the wrong sides,
which is not easily fixable unless you're comfortable pulling out pins.
It's generally not that big of a deal-- he's still a fully functional toy--
but his arms do look slightly more awkward because of this.

     Hoist is about middle-of-the-road
for the Botcon 2013 boxset. It's a good, solid deco on a good mold-- with
some ingenious "suspenders" paint apps-- but the head is ill-fitting for
the character, and-- even though the fiction explains it-- the lack of
being an actual tow truck is another strike against the toy actually looking
enough like MW Hoist. The color scheme is awesome, but the mold suitability
is a bit questionable.

     <i>
      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       One of the "second series" of Autobots
to arrive on Earth, Hoist is eager, jovial, and demands that every Autobot
sticks to his maintenance schedule-- without exception! Always keen and
willing, Hoist provides a warm and friendly environment in his workshop,
allowing his fellow Autobots to feel at ease whenever they pass through
the doors. In the last decade, Hoist has worked alongside the people of
Earth to develop the "Generation 2" process, which was later honed when
Nebulan scientists joined the research.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       With alien life forms now well-known
on Earth, Hoist no longer felt the need to use his alternate mode as a
disguise and so opted to trade in his physical wrecker hook for Cybertronian
tractor beam technology. This greatly reduces the strain on his struts
when he pulls a haul.
