    Optimus Prime's "Smash
'n Change" version's vehicle mode is fairly accurate to the movie model,
for the most part. The most obvious departure is the big handle behind
the cab section-- which is used to grab hold of the toy during the transformation
itself, so I can let that one slide. The overall proportions of the truck
mode are just a TAD more horizontal and less vertical than the actual truck,
but it's a minor enough "squishing" where it's easily overlooked. My bigger
issues have to deal with the robot extras in this mode, and I'm not talking
about the handle; the feet stick out pretty clearly from the back end,
as do the lower arms from the sides of the vehicle mode. That's also nowhere
to store the sword that comes with the figure in this mode-- I've found
that you can peg it into one of the bolt holes on the right side of this
mode, but it's unsightly and certainly not a purposeful design inclusion.
As for Optimus' colors, nothing much is changed for this version; he's
got the same old dark blue 'n gray color scheme, with a decent amount of
red in the flame paint apps around the windows and front hood. His windows
are also painted black, and his grill a rather nice shade of gunmetal gray.
All of the paint colors work quite well with the dark blue, though the
gray plastic is of a pretty boring shade; I wish some metallic flake had
been added to it, particularly in robot mode where it's more prevalent.
All of Optimus' paint apps are concentrated towards the front here; his
entire back half is entirely bereft of paint, which is definitely an oversight--
it makes it look a bit too prototypish. The headlights and/or wheel hubs
could've used some paint, too. The mold detailing is generally very sparse
in this mode, as befits the aerodynamic look of the vehicle; that said,
there's still some neat mold details here and there, like how part of the
handle is molded to look like Optimus' shield (even though it can't come
unattached).

    Unlike the other toys
in this subline, which are "FLIP 'n Change", Optimus' "Smash 'n Change"
transformation involves taking hold of his handle, turning him on his back
end, and pressing down on a flat surface; when you let go, the robot mode
will unfold a bit from the bottom of the vehicle mode, where pretty much
all of it is stored anyways; the only parts that are really shared between
the two modes are the shoulders (made out of the truck grill halves) and
the arms. (Do the same thing again to transform Optimus back into vehicle
mode.) It's not the most impressive transformation, but it gets the job
done-- Optimus is fairly proportional in this mode, though his arms could
stand to be a bit thicker/beefier. There's pretty much the entire truck
mode on his back, and it definitely sticks out of the sides of the toy
and between his legs, making it more obvious that most of this mode is
just detailing on the underside of the truck mode, but it honestly doesn't
bug me as much as I thought it would (though it certainly is still a downside);
perhaps it's that it still fits the overall shape of Optimus' robot mode.
And as for his mold detailing, it's a HUGE improvement over his vehicle
mode; movie-accurate armor plating and robotic details are all over the
place, particularly on his chest and upper legs. His face is sculpted with
the mouthplate down, and he looks like quite the formidable opponent. The
dark metallic blue paint on the knees matches the plastic very well, though
Prime's paint detailing is still a bit sparse; outside of the kneecaps,
there's a bit of red and silver on his chest and some silver on his head,
but some vital details are still unpainted, like those on his lower arms,
his "hip skirt", his eyes, and some more detailing on his chest. For articulation,
Optimus can move at the elbows (at two points); that's it, so he's very
nearly a statue in this mode. Granted, articulation isn't the point of
this subline, but a bit of helmet rotation or perhaps a bit of shoulder
movement wouldn't have hurt. Optimus can hold his sword accessory easily
in either of his fists, but it's molded so that it fits into his fists
at an angle-- a bit odd, but it works given the largely static nature of
the toy.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Age of Extinction's
"Smash 'n Change" Optimus certainly has his share of downsides; almost
no articulation, some obvious robot bits in vehicle mode, a rather boring
(if effective) transformation, and not enough paint details in either mode.
All this said, the mold detailing on his robot mode is great, and he's
the only "simplified Optimus" toy of the line that manages to retain pretty
accurate proportions in both modes without really obnoxious extras. Thus,
even though he's my least favorite mold of the "Flip/Smash 'n Change" subline,
I'd still recommend him the most out of all the AoE simplfied Prime toys
out there.
