    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Legends
"G1" Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot
Alliance Legends "G1" Starscream

     Pretty much any Starscream
mold is bound to be repainted into at least one of his Seeker brethren,
and for the Autobot Allliance Legends mold, that other Seeker is Thundercracker.
Like nearly every other Thundercracker repaint, this one does it fairly
by-the-numbers and keeps things quite accurate to his
     <a href="g1thundercracker.html">
      original
G1 toy
     </a>
     . His main color of dark blue is a bit darker here than on most
other toys of Thundercracker, but it still has that nice semi-metallic
glittery shade to it and looks quite good. Black is used on the nosecone
and a few robot mode bits, but it's not nearly as prevalent here as on
most other Thundercracker redecos. The light red stripes on the wings,
the metallic bronze cockpit, and the painted chest and head also look quite
nice and contrast well, but my main (well, only) complaint about this color
scheme is that there's a bit TOO MUCH dark blue plastic. Some other bits,
like some of his tailfins or weapons, being painted black really would've
helped break up the colors a bit more, particularly in vehicle mode.

     There haven't been any
mold changes made to the core figure, except little peg holes for new weapons
that were introduced to this mold with the "Dollar Store Release" of this
mold as Starscream-- namely, two extra shoulder-gun accessories. Don't
get me wrong, they're neat little extra weapons, but... this mold was already
engineered to have the shoulder-guns form out of the middle of the jet
mode. Including another two shoulder-guns seems really superfluous and
honestly rather silly, though I'm not going to outright call it a knock
against the figure since they ARE extra accessories that the mold didn't
have before.

     Generations "GDO" Thundercracker
is a nice repaint of a supremely okay mold. The shades of color on this
version of Thundercracker are done quite well, though a bit more paint
in vehicle mode would've helped break things up a bit more. Recommended
over this mold's releases as Starscream.

       The mighty sonic booms that echo in
the wake of his passage strike terror into all who oppose Thundercracker.
Though he is not wholly devoted to the Decepticon cause, he does take great
joy in raining destruction down on fearful Autobots trapped on the ground
beneath him.
