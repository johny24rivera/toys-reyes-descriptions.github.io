    , the most popular character from the TF Movie gets a Cyber
Slammer of his Concept Camaro version as well! As you'd expect from this
subline, the Concept Camaro is very kiddie-fied in this mode, with very
chunky proportions and smooth edges. There's also only mold detailing where
absolutely necessary, with most of the top of the vehicle mode not having
much detailing on it to emphasize the "kiddy-ness" of it. The inside of
the tires is detailed particular well, however, as is the front bumper.
The paint detailing in this mode is quite good, however, with the black
paint taking on a particular glossy-ness that looks pretty good, and things
like the inside of the tires and the Chevrolet logo on the front painted
silver even though they didn't really NEED to be. The color scheme looks
good, as it always has on Bumblebee, and appropriate given his name. The
dark silvery blue used for the windows look good against the fairly bright
color of yellow, as a lighter shade of the color wouldn't have created
as much contrast between the two colors. The back bumper could use a little
more detailing, like a license plate or something, however.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Bumblebee can be locked in car mode by pushing the white tab on the bottom
of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Bumblebee's robot body
into his car mode, the car will take off (providing he's on a flat surface),
and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode body will pop back
up again. Because of this gimmick, Bumblebee doesn't really have any lower
body in robot mode, just most of his car mode. His main body, head, and
arms are molded onto the underside of his car mode roof and doors. The
mold detailing on his robot parts is particularly good, though, with his
waist and chest being particularly well-detailed. I like how they adapted
the very complex movie design accurately in this mode, yet still made it
look kid-friendly without it looking too forced. Bumblebee still has the
same "cutesy optics" that he had on his '70s Cyber Slammer version, but
they're slightly-more-serious full circles this time instead of chibi-like
semi-circles-- I think this look fits a bit better, overall. It's also
nice to see that Bumblebee's right arm is in its gun form, as it helps
to differentiate him a bit more from his '70s Cyber Slammer. The underside
of the lower arms aren't painted black like the rest of them, though, which
I find rather odd-looking and a weird choice. As for articulation, it's
like any Cyber Slammer's-- his head can turn and his arms can move at the
shoulders, though the latter snap back into their default position after
you let go of them.

    Given that he's the
"newer, sparklier version" of the Movie's most popular character, this
Cyber Slammer is undoubtedly the most popular one of the assortment for
young tots, but he's also one of the better Cyber Slammer molds design-wise
as well, which is always good. He still suffers from the same limitations
of any Cyber Slammer, as he's definitely aimed at little little kids, but
for what he is he's a fairly decent toy. Recommended for kids too young
to get the more complex toys, or for yourself if you're a particularly
big Bumblebee fan, don't mind gimmick-laden toys, and don't cutesy TFs.
