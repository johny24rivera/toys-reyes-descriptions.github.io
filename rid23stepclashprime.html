    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Like with most of the
other "Clash" redecoes of Optimus Prime, this version keeps Prime's red,
but replaces most of his blue with a charcoal black, along with some white
and more accent colors. That's the cliffnotes version, at least. Going
into more detail, the red used on the cab is almost the exact same shade
as that on the cab of the original 3-step Optimus Prime toy, but most of
the rest of his red is just a titch darker of a shade-- which I actually
quite like, as this redeco as a whole is a bit "darker" and it contrasts
well with the charcoal black while still "complementing" it a bit better
by being darker. Unfortunately on this version there's a pretty good amount
of boring light milky gray as well, used on the pieces above the wheels
as well as on the upper robot legs and a few minor connector parts. Because
of the mold color breakup, these colors come together rather haphazardly
on the back end of the truck mode-- they don't clash or anything, but the
abrupt transition back there without any mold detailing to really justify
the change in colors does look a bit off. My favorite part about the new
color scheme is all the white paint used on several charcoal black parts,
particularly in Prime's robot mode-- he's got extensive white paint detailing
on the lower legs, on the sides of the waist, on the bottom of the shoulders,
and on the sides of the lower arms. In every place all that extra contrast
really helps to sell Prime as an "upgrade" over the original. There's also
a bit of nice light blue on the sides of hte lower arms and on the truck
headlights, as well as some silver on the front grill, charcoal black on
the truck windows, and some silver and light blue on the robot faceplate
and eyes. (Speaking of the head, it's the only part of the toy that is
Optimus' "traditional" dark blue.)

     Surprisingly, there
are several mold changes made to this version of Optimus Prime; all of
them stylistic detail changes to help Optimus look more like his Season
1 finale upgrade. Indeed, this is the only version of "Clash" Optimus Prime
that is a redeco with mold changes, but not an entirely new mold. The lower
arms have been completely overhauled with rounder details; the shoulder
pads with more angular details, including some rather nifty big triangular
pieces that poke out of the "core block" of the shoulders; the truck pieces
behind the shoulders that form a new upper back end, with some "vent" detailing;
a new headsculpt with more side antennae; and a completely new truck cab
sculpt, which is curvier overall than the original with larger headlights,
a smaller grill, and two front windows as opposed to one long windshield.
Optimus also comes with a bright orange Decepticon Hunter sword, which
gives the toy a much-needed weapon (and which can also plug into pegs on
the side back of the truck mode for storage). I like the original truck
cab design slightly more, but other than that all the mold changes I love.

     If you're going to buy
one (U.S.-released) version of the Season 1 finale upgrade design of Optimus,
make it this one. The mold changes are surprisingly extensive and look
awesome, he's got some great paint detailing (especially in robot mode)
and a slightly improved color scheme, and has everything that the more-expensive
$30
     <a href="rid2megaprime.html">
      "Mega Prime"

     toy has, minus the useless
Mini-Con ports but with a nifty weapon. Smaller versions of this design
just mimic the color scheme (if that) with no mold changes, and thus don't
really capture the design effectively.
