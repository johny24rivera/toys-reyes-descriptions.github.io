    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Downshift. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Downshift

     Big Daddy is an homage
to a character no serious Transfan ever expected to have again-- he's based
heavily on the G1 Micromaster of the same name, who quickly got his own
little fanbase over his utterly ridiculous name. But now Big Daddy's back
again, and in the Movie line no less! Given that his original G1 form was
a "pimpmobile" as well, redecoing the muscle car Downshift into Big Daddy
was the perfect choice, and he certainly lives up to the name "Big Daddy",
particularly in vehicle mode. The orange flames and plastic go GREAT against
the black deco, and the silver serves as a very nice secondary color. The
transparent black used for the windows has always been a fairly ugly color,
though, and just a clear plastic or maybe a transparent orange would have
worked better, though this is a minor complaint. In robot mode, Big Daddy
also looks quite good, and the purple used for his faceplate is an unexpected
accent color, but it works surprisingly well against the orange. His legs
and chest are rather plain, though, and a few more paint apps in either
of those areas would have made him look slightly less plain in this mode,
considering that his flame decoes are for the most part hidden from a front
view.

     No mold changes have
been made to Movie Big Daddy, though his Cyber Key has been replaced with
a "standard" red Autobot Cyber Key.

     Big Daddy is a great
homage to a great character with a ludicrous name, and the black/orange
color scheme works very well for a pimped-out muscle car. He's a bit plain
in robot mode, and I don't like the transparent black windows, but other
than that he's a great repaint. Recommended over Cybertron Downshift.

       Big Daddy is more concerned with his
paint job than with any war that might be going on. You'll most often find
him cruising the main drag of whatever town he ends up in, or hanging out
at the local beach. When he does roll out, he does it slow, so that all
the pedestrians can get a nice, long look at his sleek lines and killer
chrome. He's got his own crew of robots to roll with. They stay out of
the way of the rest of the Autobots, and the Autobots stay out of theirs.
