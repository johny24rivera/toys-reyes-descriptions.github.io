    Since so many of my comments
on Tricerashot's weapon mode rely on his beast mode, I'll start with the
latter mode. Of course, as you'd expect from a toy named Tricerashot, his
beast mode is a robotic triceratops. For the most part, this is a pretty
proportionally solid mode, with the only real issue here being that the
two horns on the sides of his headcrest are a bit overly long-- but that's
a side effect of being much of the focus of the weapon mode, of course.
There's a lot of great mold detailing on Tricerashot. His horns are quite
angular, along with the beak on the end of his face. His face has a few
vents and robotic lines on it, and he's got a no-nonsense look to him.
His four legs are molded in place, so they can't move, but there's gear-like
details around the hips/shoulders, with some stylized angular details lower
on the feet and the usual RID2015 trio of divots near the lower sides of
each foot. His main body also has a few vents and robotic lines on it,
though with a long lever coming out of the middle of it. I suppose this
could be qualified as kibble, and it DOES look a bit odd, but it just barely
sticks up above the surroundings, so it's not a big deal. Tricerashot's
tail is just the handle for his weapon mode, and is fairly undetailed because
of it, since it has to fit smoothly in a fist hole. It's a bit lower than
it should be too, kinda looking like he's... well... like he's pooping
it out. This is emphasized by the fact that it and the lever coming out
of his back are black, in contrast with the fairly bright orange plastic
used on the vast majority of the rest of the toy. There's also some black
paint on the outside sides of his horns, and his eyes are painted light
blue, but that's it-- on par with other Mini-Cons, he doesn't have much
paint. Still, the orange is a nice eye-catching shade without being too
"neon", and the black contrasts well against it. Tricerashot can move his
head up and down a LITTLE at the neck in this mode, but otherwise he's
a brick.

    Tricerashot's weapon
mode is... interesting. Basically the entire front section of the beast
mode sweeps downward, while the lever on his back and his horns move upward.
His tail and underside section also move downward, changing the orientation
of the toy so this mode is basically a tri-barreled blaster with a handle
near the back end. The long barrels themselves don't look bad, but the
main body and four legs of Tricerashot's beast mode just sorta... hang
out on the sides and above the main body of this mode. Particularly the
beast back end is an obnoxious extra, though the head folds into the main
body fairly well and out of the way so it's not that obvious. Even though
it's not the strongest weapon mode for sure, if those rear legs were taken
care of this would make a decent "futuristic alien gun", but as is it's
a bit weak. For Tricerashot's armor parts, they're a somewhat dark transparent
shade of blue, which contrast against the orange fairly well and help vary
up the color scheme some. First off, he has two pieces that slot onto the
sides of his horns to beef up those parts a bit-- however, when taking
these parts out, BE CAREFUL, as the tabs that connect them are a bit deep--
the tabs can snap off if you're not careful, which unfortunately is what
happened to me, which is why I'm using stock images for Tricershot. There's
also a larger piece that slots over his main black blaster barrel, making
it look... well, more obviously like a blaster barrel. There's also two
armor bits that can fit over his rear beast legs, and make them a bit spikier
on the back end, and there's a piece that fits over his dino snout, making
his horn a bit bigger and giving him some sharp teeth as well. Overall
they're decent armor pieces, though they more just add details as opposed
to outright enhance either mode.

    Tricerashot has an excellent
triceratops mode with an impressive amount of detailing and a solid, though
basic, color scheme. His blaster mode is definitely the weaker of his two
modes, with much of his body a very blatant extra and the mode looking
quite a bit alien as well. His armor pieces are fairly nifty, but watch
out for those horn add-ons-- they can snap off fairly easily. About a middle-of-the-road
Weaponizer, overall, with a weaker-than-normal weapon mode and a stronger-than-normal
beast/robot mode.
