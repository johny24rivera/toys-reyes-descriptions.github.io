    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Red
Alert. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron
Red Alert

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The idea for this repaint
of Cybertron Defense Red Alert into Onslaught was apparently heavily inspired
by the new
     <a href="uni2onslaught.html">
      Ultra Onslaught
     </a>
     mold also made
for Universe 2.0, given that it's now a S.W.A.T. vehicle instead of Onslaught's
G1 alternate mode of an artillery truck. Quite honestly, though, it's not
that great of an homage. If I hadn't been told that it was Onslaught--
and if Onslaught hadn't been released in another form in the same line
as a S.W.A.T. vehicle-- I never would have guessed this was him. The original
Onslaught had more a greenish-bluish-gray scheme to him, while this Onslaught
is just dull gray and black mostly, with a bit of dark blue. It's close,
but not close enough to really be enough visual recognition. Taken by itself
and ignoring the homage, Onslaught's color scheme certainly doesn't clash.
Dark blue, black, and gray are all dull colors. The silver gun provides
a nice bit of contrast, but there should have been more of that silver
paint, as the figure itself just looks waaay too dull. Not nearly enough
contrast, and what's worse, the dark blue, silver, and light red are pretty
much the exact same shades and in the exact same spots as on the Legends
of Cybertron Red Alert toy, so it actually looks a bit like Red Alert at
night time or something. Not quite different enough, if you ask me. (As
an odd side note, Onslaught here is another one of the Universe 2.0 toys
to have the Movie Decepticon symbol instead of the normal one. Huh.)

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe 2.0 Legends Onslaught.

     There's not much positive
for me to say about Onslaught. His color scheme is pretty boring for the
most part, he has too many paint apps in common with LoC Red Alert, it's
a horrible mold, and the homage is a little nonsensical to boot. Not recommended
except for completists-- save up for the Ultra-class toy instead.
