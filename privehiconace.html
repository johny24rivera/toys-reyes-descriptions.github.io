    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Beast Hunters Air Vehicon
toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Beast Hunters

     This Vehicon color scheme
debuted at the end of Season 2 of the Prime TV series, with the colors
meant to be the "elite" troopers among Megatron's many many expendable
identical underlings, who were basically just as expendable anyways. Regardless,
it's nice to see this easy redeco get released, even if it's only as a
Legion-class toy, and only outside of the U.S. (and thus he's a bit more
difficult to acquire, particularly since it's a troop builder mold). Honestly,
though, in vehicle mode the Ace Vehicon has a pretty darn boring color
scheme-- he's almost entirely white, with black paint on his window. There's
a few little red paint apps on his sides-- and his chainsaw-bayonet weapon
is a light red as well-- but these colors are used very sparingly, and
they're so light they don't provide adequate contrast against the white
and make his color scheme look too light overall. Same goes for the safety
orange stripes on the Ace Vehicon's shoulders in robot mode (not to mention
the safety orange is so close in shade to the light red it's easy to mistake
one for the other). What helps save this toy in robot mode is the really
nice, dark metallic shade of gunmetal gray painted on most of the robot
parts. It provides some excellent contrast against all that white, and
is generally just an attractive shade overall. The light red visor on the
head also looks great against said gunmetal gray, too.

     Ace Vehicon is generally
a bland redeco, with far too much white and not enough other colors to
bounce off of it and make it interesting, particularly in vehicle mode.
The dark metallic gunmetal gray helps save this toy from being completely
boring, but even then nearly all of the toy is still monochrome, with the
little bits of light red and bright orange not enough to really add much
to the color scheme themselves. If you want cheap troop builders, I'd stick
with the original Air Vehicon mold instead-- particularly since this redeco
is much more difficult/expensive to obtain.
