    Beast mode is a transmetal
blue gorilla, and is fine from the waist up. The transmetal chest and head
look extemely cool and well-designed. His "backpack" on his back is not
an extra, but a place where he can take out clubs and throw them, or shoot
them with his gun. The gun, though, doesnt have a spring in it, so you
actually have to push the club-missles through, which is kind of stupid.
The backpack also keeps the robot mode chest on his back from being too
apparent. From the waist down, this mode looks very odd. His robot feet
are basically just folded in half, and no attempt was made to conceal his
robot feet on the back side of his beast legs. His knee plates are his
feet, and dont really look like feet at all.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Vehicle mode is a gorilla
hoverboard. This is the gorilla, but his feet connect together to become
a hoverboard. Even though this isnt much of a vehicle mode, of the Transmetal
"vehicles", this one is one of the coolest, if you ask me. His gun that
he uses to shoot clubs becomes a waist-mounted rocket in this mode, to
"propel" Optimus through the skies. Smaller figures can fit on his hoverboard
to "ride" along with Optimus.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    His robot mode is, in
my opinion, better than both of the aforementioned modes. He has a more
"ape-man" look, with an ape-like face and an organic, furry chest. The
legs look better in this mode, as they are finally folded all the way out.
His arms are basically the same as the beast mode arms, except you switch
the hands.
   </font>
   <br/>
   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overall, the only thing
about this toy that I think is poor is the way the legs look in the beast
mode. Very highly recommended.

      Changed into a mighty, metal gorilla
by a planetary destruction device, Optimus Primal has a built-in, rocket
powered hoverboard that lets him hang ten on the air-waves of the Beast
Wars world! Stronger and faster than ever, he converts to become the huge,
organically enhanced Maximal General loaded with weaponry. Predacons who
value their health best avoid any monkey business with metal Optimus Primal!
