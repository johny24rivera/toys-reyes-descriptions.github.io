    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Dinobot Transmetal 2. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Dinobot Transmetal 2

     Beast mode is a transmetal
velociraptor. I can not stress how cool this color scheme looks on this
beast mode; even though the color scheme on the original Transmetal 2 Dinobot
was cool, this is much better. This mode looks much more like a killing
machine than a heroic Maximal. I especially like the transmetal "oily"
black, as it makes it look like it has a thin coat of oil over these parts.
This mode does suffer from the same flaws that the original Transmetal
2 Dinobot had, however.

     Robot mode is equally
fearsome. Here, a couple things seem a bit different from Dinobot Transmetal
2. These things can be noticed from the beast mode, but it's easier to
notice them in this one. For one, the joints are tighter (although this
may just be my toy), and two, the Predacon spark crystal has been replaced
by a dark purple Dinobot one. The picture on the box shows him in robot
mode holding his tail as a weapon, but this seems to large for a weapon,
and doesn't fit in his hand very well anyway.

     A great repaint; in
my opinion, one of the best repaints ever. Highly recommended.

       Size, strength, speed and superior intelligence
are all trademarks of Rapticon. As fierce and cutthroat in battle as he
is with insults and one-liners, but Vehicons would much rather be on the
receiving end of his verbal assaults than his physical ones. Reinforced
tail can smash Vehicon weapons and bodies to pieces almost instantly. Enhanced
vision allows him to eye the enemy from massive distances and immediately
identify weak spots in their formations. Sonic roar can cause permanent
damage to Vehicon radars and sensors. Devises and executes ambushes and
raids with unmatched precision and success.
