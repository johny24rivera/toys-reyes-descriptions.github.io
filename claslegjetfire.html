    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron

     There's already a
     <a href="clasjetfire.html">
      Voyager-sized
Jetfire toy
     </a>
     in the Classics line, but I guess Hasbro thought the character
was important enough to make a mini-sized repaint of him, too. So, here
he is! He's not really futuristic aircraft anymore, just a fairly realistic
jet, but it's still unmistakably Jetfire, given all the white and the nice
red stripes used for the deco. The red really helps to add contrast against
the white, and both are definitely very Autobot-y colors. (It is odd that
the outside of the tailfins have red stripes, but the insides of those
tailfins don't have any paint apps, however.) The bits of black and dark
blue also work great against the other colors as well, but all of the plastic
on the toy is just variations of white. The dirty white really doesn't
look all that good, and isn't nearly different enough from the "pure" white
used on the rest of the figure to provide much contrast. As such, Jetfire
looks fairly plain, especially in robot mode. More red or black paint apps
or plastic should have been used in robot mode, perhaps on the arms, to
make Jetfire look a bit less bland. (On the plus, side, though, his face
is painted very well, and really makes the character look like Jetfire
even in robot mode, even though the head itself is Cybertron Thundercracker's.)

     Jetfire is a nice nod
to the G1 toy, and the actual color scheme itself isn't bad, if unoriginal,
but Jetfire definitely needs another plastic color besides just variations
of white-- he looks a little bland compared to LoC Thundercracker.
