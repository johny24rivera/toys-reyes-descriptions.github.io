    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime legion
Rippersnapper toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Prime legion Rippersnapper toy

     Yes, the Prime Rippersnapper
mold gets another re-do as "Grimlock"-- and actually released about the
same time as the
     <a href="aoeleggrimlock.html">
      Wal-Mart exclusive AoE version
     </a>
     ,
to boot! However, though this discount store-exclusive version and the
Walmart-exclusive version are both the same mold, both named Grimlock,
and generally have brown and black as their main colors, they're about
as different as they can be while still fitting those descriptors. Their
paint masks are completely different, and black actually dominates this
Grimlock's color scheme considerably more, especially in beast mode. The
brown on this version is a more straightforward, "muddy" milky brown, compared
to the rather orangish brown shade on the Wal-Mart exclusive that was more
similar to other Grimlock toys in the AoE line. Additionally, this version
of Grimlock has a fair amount of red on him, too-- mostly on the middle
of the beast "fin" and around the "jaw gear" detailing, with a bit of red
on the robot chest, as well. These three colors go together exceptionally
well-- black works better in the greater amount that it's used, the more
traditional shade of brown just looks better, and the red paint contrasts
excellently against both colors. There's also a bit of metallic bronze
used on this version, mostly on the top of the beast mode-- and it's a
really nice shade of the color as well, quite closely matching the brown
but being just a tad lighter and metallic, both contrasting against the
black and complementing the brown. For some more accent colors, both the
robot and beast eyes are light blue, and the robot face has some silver
on it, though said colors aren't used anywhere else and thus don't contribute
to the overall scheme much, though they do look nice.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Grimlock-- like the other AoE legion Grimlock,
he unfortunately doesn't come with any weapon.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     This legion class release
of "Grimlock"-- with its increased usage of black-- makes it look even
less like the AoE version of the character, much less any version of Grimlock,
but honestly I'd recommend you ignore that. It's a great mold in a great
scheme with just the right amount and shade of each color, and just looks
great, regardless of who he's supposed to be. Recommended over the Wal-mart
exclusive version of AoE Grimlock, and recommended that you just name him
something else and accept the fun little guy into your collection.

      *This toy's packaging does not actually have the "Age of Extinction"
label anywhere on it-- simply the "Transformers" logo-- but given that
it was released at the same time as the AoE line and the colors and name
are clearly inspired by AoE Grimlock's colors, I've included it in the
line for simplicity's sake.
