    Megatron's vehicle mode
is a tank, and is an almost direct copy of his Generation 2 toy, despite
his packaging having the usual "Classics Series" moniker on it. The fruity
purple-on-green camo scheme, though not realistic, is typical of Generation
Two, so I suppose it's appropriate for this homage. The added dark gray
in robot mode helps to ground the colors a little more in reality, at any
rate. The mold detailing on the toy is fantastic, with little mechanical
plating and other relevant detailing everywhere. The proportions for a
tank are also pretty spot-on. The camo scheme is also very crisp and well-done.
Unfortunately, due to the transformation and the inherent limitations of
the size class, the turret can't rotate and the cannon can't move up or
down in this mode. That's not an insignificant downer, though it's the
only downside of this mode overall.

    Megatron's robot mode
is also highly reminscient of his G2 version, with the same overall proportions
and the same cannon mounted on the right side of his shoulders (though
it's actually attached to the right side of his head on this version due
to his transformation). The chest is a bit broad, and his lower legs rather
large compared to his upper legs, but this is to be expected because of
the transformation and the homage. The head sculpt is extremely well-done
for the size, being quintessentially Megatron and with very crisp details,
both when it comes to the mold and the paint. About the only thing I don't
like about this mode is that the arms have no discernable elbows, are rather
oddly bulky in the wrong areas, as they're halves of the turret from the
tank mode. As for articulation, Megatron is above-average for a Legends
class figure-- he can move at the shoulders, hips, knees, and neck, so
you can get a fair number of poses out of him, and he's not particularly
back-heavy, so no problems there.

Megatron is both a great homage to the G2 era-- an era seldom homaged--
and just a great toy in and of itself. The camo scheme is a bit funky,
but if you can get past that I'd recommend him even if you don't normally
pick up Legends toys. One of the best of that size class.
