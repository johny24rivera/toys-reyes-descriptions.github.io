    Blurr's vehicle mode
is a highly futuristic sportscar, and is a definite homage to his G1 self,
both in terms of color and general alt mode appearance. Blurr's windshield
and body are very slanted and swept back (while still being slightly angular
as per the Animated style), and give every bit the impression that he's
one speedy guy. His light blue color scheme works well with the dark blue,
and the transparent aquamarine headlights are the figurative icing on the
cake. The greenish-blue electric lines Blurr has on the top and sides of
his car mode remind one of electric circuitry, and look good-- they help
to break up all of his pale light blue in this mode. It's a good thing,
too, as Blurr has little mold detailing even for an Animated toy, no doubt
to emphasize his speediness. Black works well as a contrast color, though
it's not as apparent in this mode as it is in robot mode-- it's mainly
just used for his windshield and tires here. (It's amazing how you can
make a toy look interesting just by using variants of the color blue, for
the most part.) Blurr has the Elite Guard symbol smack dab in the middle
of his front bumper, and if you press down on the piece of plastic right
behind that symbol, a transparent sawblade will pop out, which gives Blurr
some fighting prowess-- it's a pretty cool placement for a weapon. However,
this mode isn't quite all sunshine and lollipops-- Blurr's vehicle mode
really doesn't have a back end, it's just hollow with the robot head tucked
away (and that odd little antennae sticking up-- it just looks weird in
this mode). However, on the plus side the hollow back end means you can
see all the way through his two rear tires that have no spokes, which is
a pretty cool design decision.

    Blurr's robot mode has
just as much personality as his vehicle mode, being incredibly lithe, skinny,
and tall, as well as having the aforementioned aerodymanic look to make
him look speedy. He has the trademark Blurr antennae coming out of the
middle of his head, which look much more fitting here than it did sticking
out the back end of the vehicle mode, and the mold detailing of his robot
parts is fairly nice, with his face having an ever-so-slight smile on it.
The black and dark blue detailing on his robot parts helps break up the
light blue a lot more than in vehicle mode, so he looks darker overall
this time around. I also enjoy how the spoke-less wheels make up his feet,
giving him "wheel-feet", a bit of an homage to Cheetor's design from the
cancelled Transtech line. The aquamarine light piping used for his optics
works quite well to boot. He has no real vehicle mode kibble to speak off
besides one small panel folded completely behind his upper back, but his
skinny robot lower arms and upper legs are just molded and painted on plastic
"shards" of his car mode, which is something the Animated line is usually
able to get around. Particularly when it comes to the upper legs, this
looks rather out-of-place at this scale in this line and makes him look
a bit blockier than he should. His chainsaw weapon detaches and can be
held in either of his hands in this mode, but considering that the entire
front part of the car comes off with it, it's a rather bulky weapon and
contrasts way too much with Blurr's skinny form, looking really out-of-place.
Blurr has pretty good articulation-- he can move at the neck (at two points),
shoulders, elbows (at two points), waist, hips (at two points), knees,
and ankles. Sideways movement at the knees is the only major articulation
point missing.

    Animated Blurr has a
lot of personality-- as one has come to expect from the Animated line designs--
and a great vehicle mode, but merely molding so much of his robot mode
onto parts of his vehicle mode is his big downside and keeps him from really
standing out. Still, if you like the character, mildly recommended.

      Blurr never stops moving. It's a habit
he's gained over centuries of working as an undercover agent for the Autobot
Elite Guard. Constant mobility is the best way to avoid detection by Decepticon
agents. He is used to remaining in vehicle mode for months or years at
a time-- as long as it takes to complete his mission, learn what he needs
to know, and escape. Unfortunately, because he spends so much time alone,
he's not really used to talking so others can understand him.
