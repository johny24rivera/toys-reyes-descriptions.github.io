    Skids makes his return
in Dark of the Moon as a Chevrolet Spark again, but despite the alt mode
being used again this time around he's a completely new mold. Thankfully,
in vehicle mode he still retains the excellent, accurate proportions that
his previous mainline toys had-- probably pretty much a requirement, given
that he's a licensed vehicle, but still. The only real robot mode extras
are the small light green bumps that form his feet sticking out from below
his back end, but those are minor at best. You can also just BARELY see
his robot mode parts behind his windshield, but they're tinted well enough
that from a casual glance they aren't obvious (particularly if you turn
his robot head to face the interior). There are a few unsightly "cracks"
on the rear half of this mode, but I wouldn't call those outright extras,
either, particularly since it's a black car anyways. The color scheme of
Skids has been reversed for all of his Dark of the Moon toys, and it looks
good-- having just black and the tinted windshield colors would've looked
boring, but the two stripes of light green paint down the center (along
with the silver headlights and dark red taillights) really look nice and
give some pop to the color scheme. Skids has two Mechtech ports, both on
sides of his roof. If you slide the red "sights" button back, Skids' Mechtech
gun transforms from a gun with two vertical barrels to a longer one with
two skinnier silver barrels. It's hard to see what this would really accomplish,
but it's still a bit of a cool transformation, even if it can't lock into
place in its "extended" mode, which is unfortunately the case with nearly
all the other Mechtech guns.

    Skids' robot mode is...
well... Skids is supposed to have goofy proportions, that's a given, but
not THIS goofy. His chest is too big proportionally (or his head too small,
take your pick), and his lower arms have obvious, unsightly panels on their
backs (one flips around to reveal some green detailing, but it still looks
bad). His shoulders look okay enough, but they actually articulate a little
BELOW where you think they would, so it looks a little weird if he has
his arms extended out in front of him. His
    <a href="rotfskids.html">

    had really tiny feet and a bit of a problem standing up by himself--
well, they WAY overcompensated on this version. His feet, despite the fact
that they're supposed to be at least a little on the small side, are RIDICULOUSLY
huge-- it seriously looks like there's an extra joint near the heels that
should fold down to make his legs taller and his feet shorter, but no such
luck. On the plus side, the car roof kibble hides behind his main body
well enough and doesn't get in the way of articulation, and the shells
of the back end stick out a tad from the legs, but don't get in the way
of articulation either. The increased number of green in this mode helps
to make Skids pop color-wise again, though I wish his arms were more green
than that blah bluish gray. His face is excellently detailed, looking pretty
much like it jumped out of the movie design (but with more black because
of his new color scheme)-- the aquamarine eyes are nice-looking, as well.
The mold detailing is also quite good on the robot parts, particularly
on the arms, chest, and upper legs, where little pistons and the like are
molded in everywhere. When it comes to articulation, Skids can move at
the neck (at two points), shoulders (at four points), elbows, at the wrist
on his right (larger) hand, and at the hips and knees (at two points).
So generally you can get his upper body into a decent number of poses (though
he may look odd given the aforementioned issue with his shoulders), but
his lower body is less impressive, with such short legs and knees that
can't bend backwards due to... well, I'm not sure. There's no real reason
why they couldn't, but they aren't molded to, so they can't. Huh. He does
have a ton of Mechtech ports in this mode, though-- one on his upper back,
and two on each arm, so you can really pimp him out with weapons if you
want.

    The deluxe version of
DotM Skids has a pretty nice color scheme and vehicle mode, but his robot
mode is so horrendously awful proportionally that it's very difficult to
recommend the toy to anyone except hardcore completists (and that's taking
into account that his proportions should be a bit goofy to be movie-accurate).
Yeah, he got a bit simpler of a transformation in this version, but the
trade-off isn't nearly worth it. Save up and get the

      Autobot Skids has learned a lot in the
last few years. Frequent battle has hardened him, and partnership with
humans has made him more sensitive to the value of life. Now, though he
is still an eager warrior, his first priority is always the defense of
those under his protection.
