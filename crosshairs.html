    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Strongarm. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Strongarm

     The first thing that
comes to mind when I look at Crosshairs is the Botcon 2005 exclusive
     <a href="fallback.html">
      Fallback
     </a>
     --
the two are quite similar in their overall color schemes, even down to
the light blue accents (which in Crosshairs' case, are prerequisites since
he's in the "Allspark Power" part of the line). The major difference between
the two is that the placement of the light tan and the dark brown are reversed
on Crosshairs, with Crosshairs being overall lighter-colored than his much
more expensive mold partner. Personally, of the two I like Crosshairs'
color placement slightly more, though I think both look great and suitable
for a jeep. The light blue accents on both toys are in roughly the same
places, and contrast very well against the other colors, though Crosshairs
has a little more blue than Fallback. I wish Crosshairs' charcoal black
parts were a more solid black, however, as that almost always looks better
in my opinion. I also don't think transparent black plastic looks all that
great, so I think Fallback's cool blue-colored weapon wins out over Crosshairs'
easily in that department. Crosshairs also sports a cool desert camo deco
on the the front half of his vehicle mode, which is pretty well-done and
fits well with the overall color scheme without making the toy seem too
busy.

     No mold changes have
been made to Crosshairs-- in fact, this mold has been used so many times
now it's starting to noticeably degrade. On my toy, at least, the pegs
that hold the arms together are so shallow now they tend to come undone
if I bend the arm and then straighten it out again, so that can obviously
get rather annoying.

     Crosshairs is a great
redeco of a great mold, though I still think the
     <a href="targetstrongarm.html">
      Target

     </a>
     released earlier in the assortment has a slightly
better color scheme overall. Recommended if you don't have any other version
of the mold and can't find Strongarm, though.

       Armorer and weapons master for the Autobots,
Crosshairs is used to dealing with some of the most dangerous technology
in the galaxy. Long use has taught him to be painstakingly methodical,
but has also caused him to be so entrenched in his systematic organizational
methods that no other Autobot could ever hope to find anything in the vast
armory on Cybertron. Crosshairs is so careful that he will not issue a
weapon unless the requester fills out forms detailing  in triplicate 
his need.
