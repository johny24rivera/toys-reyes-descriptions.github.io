    changers just ain't enough
for ol' Bumblebee-- no sir, he's got a BIG version of his Concept Camaro
design in the AoE movie, as well! In vehicle mode, Bumblebee is quite large--
mass-wise, he's a bit bigger than a Leader class figure, though obviously
much simpler both in his construction and in his detailing. As you'd expect
from a licensed vehicle mode, his Camaro mode is pretty accurate when it
comes to the proportions-- there really isn't any robot extras in this
mode at all, not even on the back end. That said, a couple of oddities
do exist because of the transformation, such as the rather ugly bumps in
the front hood, odd lines along his roof, and little "chunks" taken out
of the back window, which become the feet in robot mode. This last bit
wouldn't be so bad if the tips of the pieces were painted the same nice
silvery metallic blue as the other windows on 'Bee, but they aren't, which
makes them look rather distracting. Overall Bumblebee's mold detailing
is pretty much what it needs to be in this mode, and little more-- the
grill and headlights are detailed nicely, along with the tires, but otherwise
he's fairly sleek as you'd expect from a modern Camaro sportscar. The paint
detailing is largely good-- you've got the windows painted a nice metallic
silvery blue, the bordered stripe running down the center, and some black
paint along the side and front rims, as well as filling in the grill to
help break up all the orangish yellow that's very much your typical plastic
color on a movie Bumblebee toy. All this said, at this size/price point
not painting things like the taillights and rear bumper, wheel hubs, and
the little "smaller" side windows is rather inexcusable.

    Bumblebee transforms
in the same way as the regular-sized 1-step "switchblade" Transformers,
with you taking the sides and rotating them downwards, with everything
else rotating into place for the robot mode as you do so. Because of the
increased size/budget, though, a couple of extra things happen; for one,
little feet details pop out at the bottom, and the rear roof sections slide
to the sides of the legs to unveil more robot mold detailing. Other than
those extra little bits, Bumblebee largely suffers/benefits from the same
things that the other "switchblade"-formers do in robot mode; that is,
from a side view he looks very odd and a bit too two-dimensional, with
the chest just obviously fake detailing on a panel that hangs over his
central mass and disguises (from the front, anyway) the fact that Bumblebee's
legs go up almost to his neck in this mode. Best just to look at this mode
from a frontal view. The legs are still a bit oversized, though, and the
head undersized. The mold detailing is a bit more extensive in this mode,
though not as impressive as I'd expect it to be on a movie toy, "simplified"
or not-- the angular detailing on the legs in particular just looks too
simplistic, as does the mold detailing on the backside (though to be fair,
that detailing is facing backwards/downwards in both modes). The chest
detailing is a bit better, though, with mostly accurate-to-the-movie details
but with a boxier border. His head is sculpted quite well, though I wish
his helmet-forehead thing could swing down over his face. His arms are
also detailed a bit better, with some little intricate pistons here and
there-- unfortunately, though, since his arms are mostly black, you can't
see these more intricate details much. The metallic black paint apps are
spread VERY well across the upper legs, head, and chest, contrasting mighty
well against all that orangish yellow and definitely drawing the eye. The
metallic light blue eyes look good, though 'Bee's face could stand to be
a shade or two lighter. Just as with the mold detailing, though, the paint
detailing on the lower legs is strangely lacking (basically nonexistent
on the robot-specific parts), another disappointment down there. Bumblebee's
articulation is slightly better than other "switchblade"-formers, but only
slightly-- he can move at the shoulders (at two points) and elbows (at
two points), but no movement anywhere else-- c'mon Hasbro, not even a head
twist? Bumblebee does have one deployable gimmick, and that's a starred
"ninja wheel" projectile that can be launched from the right lower arm
by pulling back on a grayish black tab on the other side of said arm. It's
solely push-activated, but travels farther than you'd think.

    The "Mega" 1-Step version
of AoE Bumblebee I'd only recommend to a very specific audience. Yes, the
1-step line is aimed at a younger audience, but even more specific than
that; given that he's really not much better than a regular switchblade-former,
but is 3x the price, this is only recommended for both A. An individual
who wants a simple toy of "modern" AoE Bumblebee but doesn't have the manual
dexterity for the smaller 1-stepers, and B. Is willing to plunk down (or
have their parents plunk down for them) $30 for a simple toy with admittedly
little playability/gimmicks for such a price. That's a REALLY tiny audience,
and honestly this is one of those movie toys that just probably shouldn't
have been made.
