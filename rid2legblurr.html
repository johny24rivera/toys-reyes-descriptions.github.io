    Blurr's alternate mode
of a race car is replicated rather faithfully for his Legion-class toy--
more faithfully than his

    ,
at least. The cockpit is actually a noticeably large bump in the body this
time, with a fairly large, sloping front hood and a vent on the top of
the hood the tapers back down to the rear section, where there's a spoiler
with little fins at the end. There aren't any robot extras at all in this
mode, though Blurr doesn't have much of a back end-- the sides form the
robot arms, but the center back section is completely hollow. The mold
detailing for Blurr is fairly minimal even for a RID2015 toy-- due to him
being a sleek race car-- but even considering that, I still expected a
bit more. His windows and sides have almost no details on them beyond just
what's required to make the general silhouette, and beyond a couple of
minor lines on the front hood and the vent on his roof he's pretty darned
sparse, even for this small of a toy. The color scheme is mostly a milky,
fairly light blue shade, and it looks great and makes for a solid main
color. There's also some dark purplish blue used for his wheels and spoiler,
which both complements and contrasts against his lighter blue. Same with
the light glossy blue used for his window paint appps. There's also some
white lines along the lower sides of this mode, but that's it-- he really
needed some more white lines, especially on the front hood which is just
begging for some more detail.

    As you'd expect from
a Legion-class toy, Blurr's transformation is pretty simple. Unfold out
the front section and flip up the front windows to become his legs and
feet; separate the sides to form his arms; and then fold down the roof
onto his back. This mode looks pretty good overall, though his shoulders
are definitely oversized due to the transformation-- he looks considerably
more "buff" than he does on the show or on either of his other RID2015
toys. His roof section does fold away on his back, but it is still definitely
a piece of kibble sticking out a bit, so that's a minor downside. Otherwise,
there's little to complain about given the size. All of his necessary robot
mode mold detailing is here, like his "racing helmet"-style head with large
visor-like eyes and a "normal" face. Like many RID2015 toys, it looks like
his chest is made up of the crumped front section of his vehicle mode,
with little technical details especially apparent around his abs and waist.
(His hands are also detailed into his arms, but they're fairly basic.)
The windows from vehicle mode make for pretty nice feet. Having the spoiler
halves fold onto his shoulders like on the show, despite being such a small
toy, is an unexpected plus. What really makes this mode pop, though, is
the color scheme-- he does have a bit more dark purplish blue plastic on
his upper legs, but there's an impressive number of paint apps for a Legion
toy. There's white on his lower arms, the center crest of his head, his
face, and on angular paint apps on the sides of his chest. There's also
light glossy blue paint apps on his upper shoulders, his visor, the faux
window in the center of his chest, and his waist. All in all, it makes
for a pretty varied, eye-catching color scheme; he's certainly not wanting
for paint apps here. For articulation, Blurr can move at the shoulders
(at two points), elbows, knees, and slightly at the ankles-- this is slightly
above-average for a Legion-class toy, so kudos to Hasbro for that.

    He has some minor faults--
a fairly large piece of back kibble in robot mode and overly large shoulders,
as well as not enough details in vehicle mode-- but overall, Blurr is a
solid Legion class toy. His transformation may not be anything mind-blowing,
but this does a pretty good job of showcasing the design at a small scale.
Recommended over the 1-step changer if you want a simple-to-transform version
of the character.
