    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Alternator Smokescreen.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Alternator Smokescreen

     Unlike Smokescreen, which
had a bit more of a departure from his G1 color scheme, Silverstreak's
is spot-on with his
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      G1 scheme
     </a>
     in almost
every way. The metallic silver, the black, and the dull red are all in
pretty much the exact same place they were on the G1 toy, and it's definitely
one of the heaviest G1 nods in recent years. And the color scheme still
looks absolutely fantastic- I really do love his silver paint-coated body,
even if it could lead to some unsightly scratches in the paint a while
down the line. Silverstreak is a Subaru Impreza WRX, just like his mold-mate
Smokescreen, but he's a slightly different model. The "tail fin" in his
vehicle mode is smaller and more stream-lined, his front bumper is smaller
(since he's not a race car, but more of a "regular" car now), and a few
other molding details on his roof and robot arms have been altered. What's
especially surprising, though, is that his robot head is remolded as well-
something that was completely unnecessary, since both he and Smokescreen
shared the same head design in G1 anyway. It's still very much appreciated,
and helps to differentiate the two mold brothers a bit more. Silverstreak's
face is a bit slimmer, less curved, and more stern-looking than Smokescreen,
as is fitting his G1 personality. In addition, his parts seem to fit together
a bit better in car mode than Smokescreen's, although this could just be
my toy.

     Alternator Silverstreak
is a great repaint- he's got an awesome color scheme, and enough mold alterations
to justify a purchase, even if you already have Alternator Smokescreen.
If you only want to get one, though, I'd recommend Silverstreak just a
tad more than Smokescreen- even though Silverstreak gets rid of all those
cool logos in vehicle mode, his overall color scheme is a bit better, and
I like his head design a bit better than his predecessor's. An excellent,
excellent toy, so long as you don't mind complex transformations.

       (NOTE: There is a rare variant of Silverstreak that was released in
the United States, which had the steering wheel on the right side, not
the left-- as was the case with real cars in Japan. However, most of them
had their molds fixed to reflect the accurate U.S. model upon their release
stateside.)
