    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Lockdown.

     The theme of the 2013
Subscription Service toys was that, namely, there WAS no theme, allowing
for something for everyone. Circuit is the Transformer in the lot that
is aimed at those who like the loud late '80s/early '90s color schemes,
and throws a bit of movie aesthetic in there for good measure. The original
G1 Circuit was an Action Master, and a redeco of G1 Axor, like this toy
is. As they almost always do, the Transformers' Club folks have done a
wonderful job at laying out Circuit's colors and paint apps so that there's
no large area of him without color variation. His "main" color is an orangish
yellow, but that's FAR from the whole story. He's got quite a lot of pinkish
red-- particularly on his robot mode parts, but also on the rear of his
car mode with really pretty curved stripes helping to "blend it in" with
the yellow. It goes quite well with the other colors (particularly the
yellow and orange), but what REALLY makes the color scheme pop, in my opinion,
is the light blue used mostly in vehicle mode-- on the wheels, as a stripe
down the middle of the front, and on the sides near the back. It's a VERY
pretty shade of the color, and goes well with the orange in particular,
which is also used as accent color and complements the orangish yellow
quite nicely. The transparent blue used for the windows and eyes also complements
the light blue, as well. With all these paint apps, though, it's a shame
that the rear end of the vehicle mode is completely lacking in paint apps--
the taillights and tailpipes should have been painted, at least.

     No mold changes have
been made to Autobot Circuit, though he shares the same head &amp; weapon
mold changes made to the toy for

     TFSS Circuit certainly
isn't for everyone-- he looks like he's made of Starburst, and he's ridiculously
colorful for a sportscar, even the stylized one the Lockdown/Axor mold
emulates. However, if the movie aesthetic doesn't bother you and you like
the bold kitschy colors of the late G1/G2 period, this is definitely a
toy to consider, particularly given that it goes for relatively cheap prices
compared to the other TFSS 2013 toys. My second-favorite of the 2013 Subscription
Service toys.

       Circuit isn't an easy Autobot to trust;
in fact it's best not to trust him at all. While his own interests are
his only true concerns, his smooth-talking demeanor can make it seem as
though he's made terrible sacrifices for the good of others. His lies and
schemes have a wide reach-- ensnaring both Autobot and Decepticon alike--
and force Circuit to constantly travel from one location to the next or
else be caught by the victims of his scams. His invisibility shield and
decelerator cannon aid him in these endeavors, allowing him to slip out
of sight or slow his pursuers to a crawl.

       Unfortunately for Circuit, he could
only run for so long. After the fall of the Decepticon homeland, he found
himself rigged with the same teleportation tag that the Autobots had latched
onto the Decepticons. Instead of teleporting him back to a dead Cybertron,
however, the device on Circuit malfunctioned and flung him deep into the
multiverse and through the dimensional gate in Axiom Nexus.
