    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to G1 Inferno. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of G1 Inferno

     Grapple has had a significant
mold change from the Inferno version of the mold, giving him a completely
different vehicle mode; he's a crane, not a fire truck. And what's even
more remarkable about this is that only the crane arm and the part that
attaches it to the main body of the truck has been remolded; everything
else is the same, mold-wise. And yet, both have quite passable vehicle
modes. I just think that's really creative. As for Grapple himself, the
orange-yellow and black color scheme certainly isn't bad, and is quite
fitting for a tow truck. However, that being said, I still like Inferno's
red-white-and-black color scheme a bit better, seeing as how it has a little
more variety than this one. Also, in robot mode, this mold now has even
MORE unsightly vehicle mode junk hanging off the back of the head, and
that's certainly never a plus.

     Grapple (Oops, I'm sorry...
AUTOBOT Grapple... darn trademarks...) is fairly good for a Generation
One toy, but his color scheme and that extra bulk behind his head make
him slightly worse off than G1 Inferno, in my opinion. Add to that the
expensive $30 price tag, and I'd recommend him only for hardcore G1 fans
and completists. (Or if you're just plain rich and need something to spend
money on...)

       On Cybertron, Autobot GrappleÂ’s buildings
are considered works of art. On Earth, his ideas are limited by war. Takes
pride in his works, prone to severe depression if they're destroyed in
battle. As crane, can lift a 35-ton object and position it with precision
and grace. As robot, has high-temperature arc-welder rifle. Can launch
rockets 4.5 miles from wrist sockets. Prone to breakdowns in vehicle mode.
