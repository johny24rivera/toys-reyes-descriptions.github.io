    Twinferno's alt mode
is one of the most unique I've ever seen-- it' s an ORANGE stealth bomber
with two dragon heads on the front. Yeah, try to figure out the reason
behind THAT one. Anyways, it's a bit difficult to judge the proportions
on this one since it's so unrealistic, but GENERALLY I would say this mode
looks pretty proportional here, with the exception being that the back
thrusters jut out from the middle section of the "body" a bit too much.
There's some definite kibble, though, since as with many of the jet-formers,
there's some noticeable "robot parts" below the main thin frame of the
jet "top" itself. From a side view, you can see basically the entire robot
legs under there, as well as the upper robot arms. Still, from many viewpoints
the orange stealth bomber parts do mostly cover them up. There is some
pretty good mold detailing on this guy, though, especially for a RID2015
toy. There's several decorative panels, lines, and divots on the main body
of the figure, with the back middle section actually looking like it's
segmented beastly armor. The back side sections do mostly look like robot
legs (which they are), but the tailfins on the back help to alleviate this
somewhat in this mode. There's some nice grid detailing on the wings (which
may be a little bit small proportionally, it's hard to say), with some
sweeping points coming off the back ends that look a bit like dragon wings--
a nice touch. The two dragon heads up front have twin horns in an homage
to

     G1 Doublecross
    </a>
    , and have some fearsome
looks to their faces with some jagged teeth (that still adhere to safety
standards, of course). The color scheme is mostly a light, fiery orange,
which of course fits the toy, with most of the robot mode-centered pieces
on the back and front a light milky gray plastic. I wish the gray was a
bit darker for better contrast, but it's still decent. The paint apps in
this mode are quite well-done, with the dragon faces being painted a metallic
orangish bronze on the top, with black horns. That orangish bronze is also
used on the front "stripe" on each wing, and there's some nice light blue
paint used on the cockpit and a few divot-like details, contrasting extremely
well against the orange around it. That said, the back end is essentially
bereft of paint in this mode, and a bit more blue on the light gray or
orange would've worked wonders. In a nifty bonus, Twinferno comes with
two sizeable flame accessories, which can either be attached to the back
ends in this mode as exhaust flames or put into his dragon heads so they
can breath fire. There is a port in the middle of the top of this mode
if you want to attach a Mini-Con Weaponizer or other toy with a similarly-sized
handle. For articulation, the two dragon heads can move up-and-down slightly
at the base of each neck, and the jaws can open and close. Given that the
rest of the toy is a vehicle, that's about as much articulation as you're
going to get in this mode.

    Twinferno's transformation
is pretty simple; unfold the back sides down to become the robot legs,
fold back the cockpit onto the upper back, fold down the dragon heads to
become the robot arms, and then flip the feet pieces forward slightly and
the wings back slightly. It's almost identical to the
    <a href="rid2legtwinferno.html">
     Legion-class
toy
    </a>
    , which makes you wonder what the justification was for making this
a non-show, new-mold Warrior toy design with so many other un-made Decepticon
beast-vehicle designs from the show, but whatever. The end result looks
pretty cool, and I do like the usage of the dragon heads as the hands in
a nod to G1 Doublecross, though unfortunately they didn't give him the
articulation to move the dragon heads sideways to look more like claws
in this mode. The proportions are pretty spot-on in this mode, with little
kibble; I find the wings frame the shoulders quite well, and the jet cockpit
kibble behind the upper back stays out of the way and makes itself obvious
in very few angles. I don't like the feet pieces, though; they don't quite
come out far enough. They feel like they should come out just a bit more
to make the feet completely flat, but nope, they stop just a bit short
of that, making the feet slightly uneven (though he's still pretty stable).
The head looks like a more "cartoon-ized" version of G1 Doublecross (with
different colors), with a fairly standard helmet design with a bronze vent
in the middle of the forehead, a blue visor with a slight indentation for
the non-existent nose, and a "normal" silver-painted mouth. The main body
details are really well-done with some detailing on the chest that looks
like crumpled-up vehicle parts (even though that honestly makes no sense
given how his vehicle mode looks), and there's some GREAT ab details with
some circuitry lines here 'n there, and the front of the abs is painted
silver with some bronze details. The arms and shoulders are fairly straightforward
and mostly what you've seen from the vehicle mode, minus the pointy kneecaps
and the bronze paint on the front of the feet. The addition of the black
on the middle of the arms and the upper legs helps break up the colors
even more, really making Twinferno actually NOT look like he needs more
paint, for once. For articulation in this mode, Twinferno can move at the
neck, shoulders, elbows (at two points), at the jaw for each head-hand,
and at the hips (at two points), and knees. So overall he's pretty poseable,
though I did wish he had waist rotation.

    Warrior class Twinferno
is a pretty cool, very unique design, although a bit simplistic for the
size class. He does have some kibble issues in vehicle mode like a lot
of jet-formers, but his robot mode is nearly flawless. That said, with
the exception of the flame extra bits and more articulation, there's nothing
this toy has that the cheaper Legion-class toy doesn't have-- so keep that
in mind when deciding which version to buy, if you don't want them both.
