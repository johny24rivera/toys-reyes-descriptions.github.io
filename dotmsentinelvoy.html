    Sentinel Prime's voyager
class toy is, like his other Dark of the Moon toys, a Rosenbauer fire truck
in vehicle mode. Despite its smaller size, this Voyager-class version has
all of the essential details in this mode that the
    <a href="dotmsentinel.html">
     Leader-class
    </a>
    version has, including little "handrails", headlights, clear front and
side windows, "grate" mold detailing on the top, and the like. There aren't
really any obvious robot mode extras to speak of in this mode, either,
with pretty much everything being covered up pretty well. A bit of his
robot mode "collar" can be seen inside his clear windows, but his head
is retracted into his body, so it doesn't look that bad. His chest piece
also hangs down below the bottom rim of the vehicle a tad, but not enough
for it to be particularly noticeable from most angles. His color scheme
of gray, black, and red isn't particularly exciting, but they go well enough
together and it is certainly very fitting for a fire truck, so no real
complaints there (though I would've preferred if his gray plastic were
a bit more of a metallic shade). Major details like the Rosenbauer emblem,
"FIRE RESCUE", "316", and ominous partially-scratched-out Autobot symbols
are painted on the sides of this mode, but some of the minor details like
the headlights and taillights are missing, alas. I do like that the pieces
for Sentinel's siren are colored blue, though-- it helps give that area
of the mode at least a bit more color. As for his Mechtech weapon, it's
on the top where the ladder/hose should be. In its normal mode it resembles
just that, but if you push it up a bit and then press down on the large
black button near the back, the pieces will rearrange themselves to look
like a long railgun. Unfortunately, like most other Mechtech weapons it
can't stay in that mode, which is rather lame. Even lamer is that the Mechtech
weapon is eseentially stuck to Sentinel's roof/back; you have to detach
it from a clear plastic gear to actually get it off the toy, which was
a pretty major oversight, if you ask me. Still, if you do that, he can
hold it in his fists in robot mode.

    As opposed to his considerably
more complex Leader class version, this version of Sentinel Prime's transformation
mostly involves you "peeling back" his alt mode into one big cape. Really,
the only parts that are shared between the two modes are the wheels on
his lower legs and his feet; everything else forms one huge backpack for
the guy. Now, granted, he does have a "cape" of some of his alt mode parts
on his movie model, but this goes rather far-- thank goodness for Sentinel's
little flip-out heels on his feet to stabilize him, otherwise he'd be constantly
falling backwards due to the weight of his backpack (to say nothing of
the weight of it with his Mechtech weapon still attached to it). At least
his backpack pegs in firmly to his actual back, though, to prevent a bunch
of flopping around. His chest transformation is also considerably less
elegant, with his "chest tires" merely moving downwards a bit while a faux
chest front piece slides up. The detailing on it doesn't quite match the
movie model's either; it's a bit too long and angular. Same with the headsculpt;
the beard is too short, and the chin bits in general just seem off. The
paint detailing on his chest, head, shoulders, and feet is also weirdly
fuchsia instead of a similar red to the rest of his plastic, and THAT'S
certainly not movie-accurate. The rest of his detailing is quite good and
accurate to the movie, so having such two major features be "off" seems
odd. Proportionally, though, his "core" body is decent enough, with the
only major exception being that his shoulder pieces are too small compared
to his movie model, and his "collar" is just a tad too large. His ankles
also move at an odd point, making it look like his feet are a bit "taller"
than they should be. His articulation is pretty good; he can move at the
neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows, hips (at two points), knees
(at two points), and at the ankles. Waist articulation would've been nice,
but it isn't really possible with his transformation. So in theory you
SHOULD be able to get him into a good number of poses, but the weight of
his backpack unfortunately prevents a good number of them. Sentinel doesn't
have any Mechtech ports in this mode besides the one his vehicle weapon
occupies, but his fist holes are Mechtech-sized.

    It's honestly hard for
me to see a need for the Voyager class Sentinel Prime toy. If you don't
care about scale so much and want a simple version of the character to
transform, you've got the
    <a href="dotmcysentinel.html">
     Cyberverse version
    </a>
    ;
if you want a big, complex version, you've got the Leader version. This
in-between size doesn't really scratch either itch very well, being quite
the "shellformer" as well as having an odd, disappointing Mechtech weapon,
extreme backheaviness, and some details in robot mode that are just off.
Not recommended except for movie completists or particularly huge Sentinel
Prime fans.
