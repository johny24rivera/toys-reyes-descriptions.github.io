    Lockdown's alternate
mode is a VERY chibi-fied Lamborghini Aventador. Most of the chibi-fied
cars make the transition to Tiny Turbo Changers fairly well, but the way
Lockdown's alt mode is proportioned, the windshield seems to stop rather
abruptly, with the front section of the car showing up a bit too abruptly
compared to the relatively streamlined actual Aventador. The fact that
the actual front windshield is a hinge and not actually a molded-in window
doesn't help matters much either, and is definitely the biggest eyesore
of this mode. From the back end you can see the top of Lockdown's head
and arms, but it's not obvious from any other viewpoint, and for the size
and price point it's not a big deal. There are some of the basic shapes
that make the Aventador the Aventador here, like the angular front bumper
and headlights, the swoops on the doors, and the ridged part behind the
rear window, though beyond the stars in the wheel rims the mold detailing
here is pretty basic. The plastic is all a dull milky brownish gray on
the toy, more or less fitting how he was colored in AoE, though a bit lighter
than usual. There is some black paint here to break things up, though--
on the side windows and wheels. Of course I would've preferred some more
paint on things like the headlights, but at this small of a pricepoint
you gotta make some compromises.

    To transform Lockdown
to robot mode, fold back the front section of the car and then slide his
legs down, which slides his arms down as well. The end result is a bit
similar to some of the other Tiny Turbo Changer "carformers", with a large
section of the front car portion just hanging behind the skinny, proportionally
tiny legs as the biggest downside. The back portion of the car mode also
sticks up behind the robot head, and of course the arms are merely molded
into the sides of the car mode. Again though, this is like a $3 toy, you're
not going to get perfection, here. I find the arms and little bit behind
his back a lot easier to overlook and accept as part of the tiny design
than the chunk o' car hanging off his butt. The mold detailing on the robot
parts is exquisitely done, with tons of movie-accurate details on the chest
in particular-- almost TOO much, as there's so many details they all tend
to blend together at this small scale. The legs also have his pointed toes
and angular knees, and his arms have their main details replicated here,
too. The head isn't Lockdown's normal face, but rather with his helmet
down-- which is just fine by me, as I think Lockdown's more normal face
would look downright scary in this "superdeformed" look. There is a bit
of lime green paint in the center of his helmet, but otherwise this mode
is pretty paint-free-- a bit of a bummer given how dull the main color
is and how many molded-in details there are. For articulation, Lockdown
can move at the shoulders in this mode.

    Lockdown is slightly
below your middle-of-the-pack Tiny Turbo Changer. He uses some of the transformation
steps many other TTT car-formers do, with an extra step to elongate his
body a bit, the latter of which is appreciated. However, that big chunk
of car hanging off him in robot mode is rather unsightly, as is the weird
way the middle of his car body seems to "crunch up" against the front,
and the boring colors don't help. Still, for what he is, he largely does
the job.
