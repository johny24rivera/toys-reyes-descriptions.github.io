    Vehicle mode is a futuristic
space fighter. (Wait, what I am saying... of COURSE a space fighter is
futuristic...) Anyways, it's a very nice mode, with no noticeable robot
extras at all. Granted, if you look at him from the bottom in the mode,
you can see his robot head on the underside of his cockpit, but it's pretty
much a given with Transformers that you don't look at their vehicle modes
from the bottom anyways. The Energon gun attachment on the front of the
nosecose is a bit overkill in its length, which I assume is because of
some safety law. The Energon sword halves on the end of the wings really
add to his look, though, as they make the wings an extra bit of length
that really looks great on a space fighter. His paint detailing is really,
really great in this mode, with and his mold detailing is as good as one
can reasonably expect on a sleek vehicle such as this. His red, white,
and gray color scheme also works very nicely, and it especially becomes
apparent in his robot mode that he's a homage to G1 Jetfire. (Skyblast's
original name was supposed to be Skyfire, but it didn't clear legal for
some reason.) Skyblast also has some claws on the bottom side of his vehicle
mode which you can use to have him "grab" onto some other thing to lift
it. It actually works pretty well with long, skinny objects, and it's a
nice feature.

    Skyblast's robot mode
is also great. The proportions are top-notch-- a rarity for Energon Autobots--
and the only vehicle extras that he has complement this mode rather than
hurt it, like the wings on the back of his hands and the nosecone behind
his head. Speaking of his head, it definitely shows through as a G1 Jetfire
homage, albeit with a bit of an asymmetrical look tacked on as well (which
still looks good, mind you). One particular oddity, though, is that the
wings on the back of Skyblast's hands have plenty of paint apps in vehicle
mode, but when you turn them over for the robot mode, there's barely any
paint apps on the other side. Talk about uneven... Skyblast's articulation
is fairly good; he can move at the shoulders (at two points), the elbows,
the hips, and side-to-side at knees. Because of his transformation, though,
he doesn't have any back-and-forth knee articulation or any head articulation.
The latter isn't that big of a deal on this small of a toy, but lack of
real knees makes him look rather stiff in some of his poses. Skyblast's
Energon weapon gets a definite A+, as it makes a very convincing Energon
lance. It also has two holes to plug into a Transformer's hands- one at
the very tip of the handle and another behind the blade. It also has a
Minicon port above the latter handle, in case you want to plug it onto
any Powerlinx ports. As with the other Omnicons, Skyblast's Autobot spark
crystal is on his chest in robot mode.

    Skyblast is a near-perfect
Omnicon- he's got great proportions in both modes, a very nice color scheme,
an awesome Energon Weapon, and practically no extras in either mode. He
has a few missing points of articulation in robot mode as well as a few
other more minor problems, but they barely take away from the toy at all.
Highly recommended.

      Skyblast is a young Omnicon, capable
of great speed during flight. In jet mode, his Ariel maneuvers are considered
an artform by his Autobot allies and Decepticon enemies. In robot mode,
he possesses a powerful arsenal of piercing energon weapons that he wields
with great confidence and grace. His favorite weapon is an Energon claw,
which he has used to humble some of the toughest Decepticons. Although
Skyblast is a skilled tactician and warrior, he feels that his time is
better spent practicing his famed ariel stunts.
