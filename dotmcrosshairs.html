    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the DotM Thunderhead w/
Major Tungsten toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the DotM Thunderhead w/ Major Tungsten toy

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The most obvious change
when comparing Crosshairs to his mold's predecessor Thunderhead is that
where Thunderhead has orange, for the most part Crosshairs has either dark
or light green. Both of them keep gray as a main color, though on Crosshairs
here that gray is a slightly darker version with a barely-noticeable greenish
tint. Although that color in and of itself isn't all that exciting, the
various shades of green play off it quite well, with the shades of green
themselves complementing each other rather well. Green and gray aren't
all of the colors on Crosshairs, though; he's got a few nifty accent colors
as well, mostly noticeable in his robot mode. There's a bit of pale yellow
and silver on his chest, which keeps his main body in that mode from looking
anything but boring. The main accent color that I find works really well
with Crosshairs' palette, however, is the metallic copper, which has a
bit of bronzish tint to it as well. It contrasts exceedingly well with
both the green and the gray, and gives a bit more of a pop to the color
scheme, though I do wish it were used a bit more, particularly in places
where it would be more apparent in the vehicle and/or weapon modes.

     No mold changes have
been made to the "core" Crosshairs toy, but his human partner, Sergeant
Cahnay, is a redeco not of Thunderhead's partner Major Tungsten but rather
of the human alliance figurine that came with
     <a href="dotmicepick.html">
      Icepick
     </a>
     (Sergeant Chaos). He's got your typical military uniform meant for more
extreme conditions, and I like how the blue shades contrast against the
dark green plastic of most of his clothes; other than that, though, there's
nothing particularly remarkable about Cahnay.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     DotM Crosshairs is one
of the few redecos that I feel is pretty much exactly on the same par as
the previous release of the mold. The color scheme isn't better or worse
than Thunderhead's, just... different. The gray is a bit boring, just like
on Thunderhead, but the other colors are used pretty nicely. As for which
one I'd recommend if you only want one version, that entirely depends on
whether you like the color orange or the color green better.

       Crosshairs demands that every round
of ammunition used be accounted for. He is extremely careful in his targeting,
not wanting to waste a single shot. His rate of fire is slow, even in the
hottest combat, but his incredible accuracy more than makes up for it.
