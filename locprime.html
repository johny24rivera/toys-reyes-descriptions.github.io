     The Legends of Cybertron
Prime toy features only the truck cab, and not the trailer stuff attached
to it. And, to be honest, just by itself, the cap portion looks a little
odd, even if this small version is pretty faithful to the larger version
of the cab in most respects. I mean, it's pretty obvious where the legs
are, the feet are plainly visible without the trailer to cover them. The
waist piece also is rather obvious if you look at the toy from a side or
rear view. Another downside is that the robot head doesn't fit into the
body of the truck all the way on this toy, whereas it did in the larger
version. As it is, the truck cab doesn't do all too cool of a job passing
itself off as a vehicle rather than a robot folded up. Still, the paint
detailing is pretty good, better than on most Legends of Cybertron toys,
and the mold detailing and overall proportions are decent, too.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     In robot mode, however,
I think the proportions are actually slightly better than on the larger
version-- the legs are a bit longer, making Prime seem taller proportionally.
I really don't like how Prime's arms are set up on this toy, though-- the
middle of the arms are just thin little gray sticks that almost feel like
they're going to break off during transformation, and the lower arms are
mostly hollow, which looks pretty weird. Another small complaint is that
the detailing for Prime's face looks a little odd-- his "helmet" looks
too big compared to his face. Prime has articulation about average for
a Legends of Cybertron toy-- limited, but not brickish either; he can move
his shoulder plates up, his arms up and down at the elbows, and his feet
can move back and forth at the hips. He really could've used knee articulation,
but otherwise it's decent for such a small, cheap toy.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Prime has some positive
attributes about him, but taking away all the gimmicks, the super mode,
the trailer, and the articulation from the larger version, you also take
away the "wow" factor for the toy. Unless you're serious strapped for cash
and just HAVE to have a version of Cybertron Prime, I'd save up your money
and go for the larger version instead.
