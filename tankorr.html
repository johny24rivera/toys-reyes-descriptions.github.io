    Vehicle mode is a tank.
This mode is very nice, and, although there are few movable parts, the
exquisite detailing and the nice designs make up for this. This mode looks
practically nothing like the show version, with the exception of the huge
cannon. Tankorr's color scheme tends to be a bit more fiery here and less
metallic, which is pretty neat. One of the really neat features of Tankorr's
is his moving "eye". Open up a panel on the back of the tank "head", and
light shines in through the transparent red plastic inside, making a little
circle (the eye) light up in Tankorr's colorless bar on the front of his
head! Move the little red knob on the top of the head, and the eye moves
as well, as if it were "scanning" for enemies. Turn the knob at on the
back of the tank, and it moves both the head-turret and the eye! Another
nice feature is that the missile in Tankorr's cannon is painted two colors,
a first in any Beast Warrior or Beast Machine transformer- it's molded
to look like fire, which adds to this effect. There are, however, a few
problems I have with this mode. One of the bad things is that, sadly, the
tank treads themselves do not move, and there are just little wheels on
the bottom to compensate for them. The other major problem I have with
this mode is that Tankorr's robot head is easily visible from behind his
tank head, and it looks very odd in this position. Tankorr's robot feet
stick out a little from the middle of the tank body as well, but this is
no big loss. The spark orb is visible by lifting the red panel on the side
of the tank head.

    The "attack mode" is
little more than lifting Tankorr's front tank panels up and to the side
and extending his robot hands out to reveal chainsaws, but it still is
pretty neat. It looks like Tankorr's ready to destroy anything in his path,
because when you roll Tankorr along on a flat surface, the chainsaws rotate
as well!

    Robot mode definitely
got its design from the original Transformers. Bulky and blocky is the
name of the game in this mode. This, however, poses a bit of a problem
for me, as his arms and legs look odd- they are skinny on the upper parts,
but then are extremely fat on the bottom parts. This tends to get in the
way a bit when you are moving Tankorr in this mode. When one looks at the
mode in real life and not in pictures, they may think that Tankorr is a
bit small for a Mega. While this is partially true- Tankorr is slightly
small for a Mega- he is very compact, and this makes him look smaller than
he actually is. The little "armor plates" on Tankorr's upper arms get in
the way a little, and snap off a little easily as well, making them annoying
in this mode. Another annoying feature is that the knob on top of Tankorr's
robot head in his vehicle mode is pushed back behind his head in this mode.
The problem is, the knob is pushed up slightly every time you move Tankorr's
vehicle and/or robot heads, and it gets aggravating after you push it back
down in its place for the fifteenth time. There are a few nice features
to this mode, such as Tankorr's moving eye in his robot mode head, although
it doesn't work as well in this mode as the vehicle one does in his other
mode. The cannon is even larger than it is on the TV show, and makes Tankorr
look all the more menacing. However, while some parts look like the Tankorr
from the TV show, such as the chest and arms, other parts don't resemble
them very much, such as the legs and head.

    A very nice transformer,
but a bit too bulky in robot mode, and not very show-accurate. Recommended.

      A giant power-tank Vehicon. Tankor exists
only to crush everything under his treads that he doesn't blow up first.
Simple-minded, Tankor is unquestionably loyal to Megatron - or so he wants
everyone to think. In reality, Tankor hides his intelligence, playing the
Vehicons and Megatron off of each other so that he might someday take sole
control of Cybertron. He wields a flamethrower in tank mode, while head
mounted energy lasers top off an assortment of heavy weaponry in robot
mode. One of Megatron's three generals, Tankor is in charge of the powerful
tank drones.
