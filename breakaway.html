    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Treadshot. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Treadshot

     As the third Collectors'
Club exclusive combiner limb released for the eventual gestalt, Breakaway
follows the tradition of the previous two and has a primarily transparent
red-and-blue color scheme so that they all match up when they're merged
together. Out of the three, though, Breakaway's colors definitely seem
to be the most eye-catching to me. The transparent red is a particularly
good-looking shade, and the dark dull blue is pretty much the exact shade
as on
     <a href="bclandquake.html">
      Landquake
     </a>
     , and it looks really good
as a solid color in between all that transparent plastic. Some black and
silver accents are also used to help liven up all the translucent red parts
to great affect-- in fact, I think the only paint app that's NOT used well
is the blue-painted mouth. That just looks a bit odd, to me. Another quibble
I have with Breakaway's colors-- however small it may be-- is that his
Energon parts are a translucent smoky gray, not a translucent red. Now,
I guess looking at it from the point of view that Breakaway's already mostly
translucent red justifies making the Energon parts gray, but when all the
other combiner limbs have translucent red Energon parts... it doesn't look
bad on the toy itself, but when combined they're definitely going to look
out of place.

     Breakaway is an excellent
mold with an excellent--and varied--color scheme. If it wasn't for the
translucent smoky gray Energon parts, I really wouldn't have any complaints
about him. My favorite Collectors' Club combiner part as of this writing
(11/08).

       Breakway's memories are like the eastern
horizon at dawn. When he looks back into his past, he sees only light and
warmth and the haloed silhouettes of things that were. He remembers Cybertron
only as a word that he ascribes with the warmth and peace he knows lie
behind him. What he honestly knows in detail about his life can be emcompassed
by the pool of sacred Energon by which he slumbered for centuries.

       When he arrived on Earth it was still
a barren world. Clouds of ammonia boiled out of volcanos 20 miles high,
and the surface - an endless ocean of magma - rolled and bucked with the
chaotic energies of planetary formation. He had been sent across the galaxy,
across dimensions, with the rarest and most precious form of energy, the
source and structure of Transformers life. He alone was to guard it against
all eventualities, never to return home until Primus once again called
him.

       The call has now come, but his charge
is not yet ended. Where Breakaway goes, so does his store of rarified Energon.
He knows this is so, and he knows that this Energon is too important to
leave unprotected. What he cannot remember is exactly why it was he that
was chosen to be its guardian for so long.
