    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Universe 2.0 Ironhide.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Universe 2.0 Ironhide

     Ironhide gets his inevitable
repaint as the G1 character Ratchet, who he also shared a mold with in
the original G1 series. Ratchet's red-and-white color scheme looks decent
enough here, especially when compared with Ironhide's light red all-over.
It helps to break up the color scheme, particularly in vehicle mode. I
love the two red stripes along the sides, now with the "heartbeat" symbol
that's become associated with the character because of the movies and Animated.
The red rectangular design on the hood also helps contrast against the
white, too. I think the red overall is just a tad too light, though, considering
that the other main color is white. Ratchet also has the same different-colored
windows problem that Ironhide has, with about half of the windows being
transparent blue while the other half are just painted light blue (which,
again, doesn't contrast well with the prominent white color). Ratchet does
have a REALLY cool obscure nod, though-- his license plate says "H3L PU2",
which stands for "HELP US", a nod to a popular Marvel G1 comic cover that
had Ratchet fused with Megatron, holding up a sign that said that.

     Ratchet has two mold
changes when compared with Ironhide-- first off, the head is new, and is
more G1-comic Ratchet than G1-cartoon Ratchet in its design with the large
crest, which fits his bio and license plate nod. He also has transparent
sirens added in vehicle mode. Other than that he's the same-- a shame,
as he really could've used a slightly-modified weapon that has a medical
device, not to mention a head that folds upwards all the way in robot mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 Ratchet
is a decent enough repaint, and I love the added paint apps in vehicle
mode, but unfortunately the mold itself is a bit flawed, and the red and
blue's a bit TOO light. If you're wanting a new Ratchet that's actually
meant to be the G1 character, though, it's not like you have many other
options right now.

       Back on Cybertron, Autobot Ratchet was
the best mechanic and machinist around. The only thing that kept him from
true greatness was his constant partying. Years of war and a series of
tragic encounters with Megatron have tempered his good nature, leaving
him with a melancholy edge and a sour bedside manner. He's still the finest
medic the Autobots have at their disposal, but these days he's more distracted
by his bad memories than his late nights.
