    Instead of just re-painting
the
    <a href="movlegprime.html">
     original Movie Legends toy
    </a>
    of Optimus
Prime, he gets an all-new mold in the size class for Revenge of the Fallen.
His truck mode is a bit of an improvement over the previous one, with better,
sharper cab proportions in the front and more visible smokestacks. Everything
tabs together very solidly, so no wiggly bits here. All of the necessary
details are painted, and the overall color scheme looks a little better
than on the first movie's Legends toy-- the dark blue is a particuarly
nice shade, and the red ain't too shabby, either. The light milky gray
is as dull as ever, though, and using it for hte sides of part of the cab
doesn't look too hot-- perhaps painting them blue would've made it look
better. The mold detailing is pretty decent, with such small details like
the roof-mounted headlihgts and even the rivets on the side door steps
molded in. He doesn't have as many flames as his previous version, though--
only the very front of the cab has the blue flames, there's no red flames
on the body whatsoever. Unfortunately, just like with the first Legends
toy, the back end of the cab is horribly--almost comically-- undersized,
though at least it's colored properly this time around and not QUITE as
bad as it was with the first Legends mold.

    Prime's robot mode on
this version is MUCH better than on the first movie's Legends class attempt,
though. For one, he's got actual arms, and not just hollow details on the
underside of some vehicle parts. The chest is also proportioned MUCH better
and more movie-accurate, and the head design-- even though it's sculpted
on the front of a square piece of the vehicle mode-- looks pretty good
proportoinally and has a very nice, detailed sculpt. I'm still not particularly
enthused about the legs-- they're a bit too long proportionally, and the
feet aren't very accurate, plus there's a noticeable gap between the top
of the feet pieces and the surrounding lower leg pieces. Still, it's definitely
an improvement over the first Legends class toy in that respect. As far
as articulation goes, he's got about average movement for a toy of his
size-- he can move at the shoulders, elbows, and hips. His feet can also
bend forward slightly, but that's entirely due to the transformation.

    RotF Legends Optimus
Prime is a pretty good improvement over TF1 Legends Optimus Prime in nearly
ever respect, whether you're talking about movie-accuracy, color scheme,
or especially proportions. Granted, he's not the best toy-- he IS a Legends
class approximation of a very complex screen design, after all-- but it's
quite a good, cheap substitute for anyone who either can't afford the larger,
more movie-accurate versions of the character or just doesn't want the
complex transformations that comes with those versions. (Could REALLY use
some less of that blah milky gray, though...)
