    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Double Missile Decepticon
Brawl. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Double Missile
Decepticon Brawl

     FAB Brawl's repaint is
loosely based on the Allspark Power
     <a href="ddbrawl.html">
      Deep Desert
Brawl
     </a>
     toy color-wise, but it doesn't have to meet the "Allspark Power
electric blue" requirement of that subline, so Deep Desert Brawl's electric
blue has been replaced with a rusty brown. I have to say, I don't like
QUITE as much as the electric blue because it doesn't contrast quite as
well with the surrounding colors, but it still looks mightly good. Plus,
Desert Blast Brawl's paint apps are varied enough in vehicle mode where
he doesn't look boring, unlike Deep Desert Brawl. The usage of two different
shades of brown also works quite well, as does the painted black treads.
The only thing I'm not too fond of in regards to Desert Blast Brawl's color
scheme is the gray, namely because it doesn't contrast all that well with
the tan-- they're both dull, light colors, and gray has been rather overused
in the Movie line anyways. Plus, the toy's missiles are still gray, which
is a horrible color for pieces of plastic that are supposed to resemble
piping hot projectiles.

     Desert Blast Brawl is
a great repaint of one of the best FAB molds. Besides the rather pointless
addition of light gray, there's not much to keep me from recommended him,
even to older Transfans. Recommended over Double Missile Decepticon Brawl.

       Hidden in the most dangerous place on
Earth, Decepticon Brawl has been practicing his accuracy on anything that
happens by. Whole, huge stretches of desert are scorched and ruined by
his massive missiles and explosive shells. He knows that the Autobots are
out there, looking for him. He really hopes they find him soon, because
he's ready for a challenge.
