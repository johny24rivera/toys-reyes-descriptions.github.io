    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Backstop. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Backstop

     Okay, a bit of a backstory
here before I get on with the review itself, since Generations Backstop
is a bit of an enigma. This toy had earlier been re-released-- in its Cybertron
colors-- along with
     <a href="undermine.html">
      Undermine
     </a>
     and
     <a href="wreckloose.html">
      Wreckloose
     </a>
     as part of a discount retailer
     <a href="tfuniverse2.html">
      Universe 2.0
     </a>
     assortment (I don't review--or buy-- straight re-releases, which is why
none of those are reviewed separately). None of the toys had any changes
whatsoever from their Cybertron toys. However, the same assortment was
repackaged as Generations and re-released to most of those same discount
retailers (like Big Lots, dollar stores, etc). For whatever reason, even
though Undermine and Wreckloose were still the exact same, Backstop got
a bit of a redeco, so that's what this review is all about.

     Backstop's colors hearken
back to
     <a href="rhinoxtm.html">
      Rhinox Transmetal
     </a>
     -- whether this is
intentional or not, I don't know, but gives the toy a bit more of a draw
than a random redeco would have. Appropriately for a rhino, Backstop's
main plastic colors are a very dark, muddy brown and a dull green-- both
earthy colors that aren't too far from how a rhino's flesh actually looks.
The two colors complement each other nicely, but it's the black plastic
(primarily visible in robot mode) that gives the scheme a bit more contrast.
The silver on the rhino face and horns is another nice touch, but what
really makes Backstop eye-catching are the colors used the least, oddly
enough-- namely, the aquamarine on his lower legs and eyes, as well as
the goldish-green on his large left hand and on part of his face in robot
mode. Both contrast marvelously with the dull, earthy tones of the rest
of Backstop's color scheme, and the gold face goes really well against
Backstop's primarily black head. Also of note is that Backstop's Jungle
Planet Cyber Key has been changed to a transparent blue color on this release--
which again, contrasts well with his other colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Generations Backstop.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Generations Backstop
has a darn good color scheme, and if it's an homage to Rhinox Transmetal,
all the better. The paint apps in particular make him catch the eye, while
his main plastic colors keep his scheme relatively grounded in reality.
Unfortunately, it's a horrible mold, so I can't really recommend it at
all even with the improved colors.

       Nothing gets past Backstop. He is the
ultimate guard-- intelligent, watchful, and nearly immobile when he plants
his feet. Before the war he was a champion wrestler, a profession he misses
desperately. For now, however, he's more than happy to take a few Decepticons
apart with his bare hands.
