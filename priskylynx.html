    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Prime Skystalker. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Prime Skystalker

     Although he's meant to
be a completely separate, new character, Prime Skylynx does have a few
callbacks to his G1 self, and I'm not just talking about the fact that
both have a dragon (or dragon-like) mode. This version of Skylynx takes
G1 Skylynx's primary colors of white, blue, and red with a bit of gold
and alters most of them both to give him a more original color scheme and
to help him blend in a bit better with his partner-in-crime in the "Predacons
Rising" mini-movie,
     <a href="pridarksteel.html">
      Darksteel
     </a>
     . Skylynx's
white is a pretty pure white, just like on the G1 toy-- no changes made
there. His dark blue is a very dark, dull navy blue, much darker than on
his G1 toy, and almost the exact same shade as the prominent color on Darksteel.
This added darkness lets the blue contrast very well with all the other
colors on the toy, though having half of the wings dark blue and half white
does look a bit odd. The red is also considerably darker and duller than
on G1 Sky Lynx, letting it blend in stylistically with the dark dull blue
while still contrasting well against it. Finally, the gold on G1 Sky Lynx
is now a dark bronze (or a brownish bronze if you're talking about the
bronze plastic, used on the wing-discs). Again, this darkening of the color
works stylistically with the other duller colors, and the bronze is used
often enough where it gives the toy a bit more of a "regal" feel that it
otherwise wouldn't have had. There's also a bit of metallic silvery blue
used for the robot face, which looks okay but not as good as more of the
dark dull navy blue would have, in my opinion. (The bronze paint on the
eyes is also a bit of an odd color for such a part.) Skylynx's paint apps
are generally quite plentiful, though more of them show through in the
robot mode, with the excellent striped paint apps on the robot chest and
the bits of white and bronze paint on the upper legs. Even in areas where
there isn't much paint, though-- such as the wings-- the plastic colors
are varied up enough where they still look visually interesting, with no
one major area being solely one color.

     Taken by itself, Prime
Skylynx is a pretty nice repaint, homaging the G1 version of the character
while still going off a bit in its own direction. He's got some nice, fairly
unique color shades, and a decent number of paint apps. However, there
are two major strikes against this toy, and the first is the mold, which
is just the worst of the larger Predacon molds, with a ridiculously awkward
robot mode. Secondly, the toy looks almost nothing like Skylynx's character
model in the "Predacons Rising" mini-movie, and that's a real shame given
that this is the only toy of that show character. I realize the mold was
created before the character model, but Hasbro should've either made a
less awkward robot mode or insisted the modelers stick a bit closer to
the toy. As a redeco, it's got some nice colors, but as a representation
of Prime Skylynx it's quite poor. Recommended ever-so-slightly over Skystalker.
