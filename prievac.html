    Evac here-- despite being
in Transformers Prime-style packaging-- is actually a "leftover" mold from
the
    <a href="tfdotmtoys.html">
     Dark of the Moon
    </a>
    toyline-- from the
    <i>
     Transformers:
The Ride
    </i>
    character model, in fact! Unlike this character's
    <a href="dotmevac.html">
     deluxe
version
    </a>
    , though, this smaller version is a mass-release. (Of note is
that, despite it being in Prime-style packaging, the "Prime" subtitle is
noticeably missing from the front of the package.) Evac's vehicle mode
is a bit funky-looking, but that's on purpose-- it's a replica of the four-seated
passenger car that you go through
    <i>
     Transformers: The Ride
    </i>
    in, and
is revealed to be Evac during the ride. It definitely doesn't look anything
like a real car, but its proportions compared to the "real thing" are pretty
spot-on, with the exception of the black-painted "window" section, which
should be a bit larger. His color scheme is a moderately dark blue and
black-- it's not particularly bad, but not particularly good, either--
just a tad boring. In this mode, there's a silver-painted "turbo engine"
near the back, silver headlights, and a tad of yellow on the rear spoiler,
but generally it's almost entirely the blue and black. The mold detailing
is quite intricate on this toy, though, fitting in with a movieverse toy
with littke sylized vents and edges all over the place (and, again, accurate
to what you're in in the
    <i>
     Ride
    </i>
    ). Evac comes with the standard Autobot
Cyberverse red two-barreled weapon as an accessory, and in vehicle mode
he can hold up to FOUR Cyberverse-compatible weapons-- there's two ports
for them on each side.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Evac's transformation
is pretty par-for-the-course for a Legion car figure-- his arms form from
the sides, his legs fold out from the back half, and then you rotate his
car front down to become his chest-- but it still results in a robot mode
that's quite accurate, if perhaps a tad "leggy" proportionally. His hands
are simply molded onto the insides of his car door pieces, but again--
this is typical for a Legion class figure. I wish that the more angular
windshield pieces behind the arms had been left on his back in this mode,
though, as they are a bit distracting in a negative manner. Although he's
still predominantly blue and black in this mode, a few more paint apps
make themselves known, such as the plaster-y white on his waist and face
and the light red on his upper arms, both of which look nice against the
blue. The silver from his car mode also ends up on his chest and inner
legs, as well, so Evac's color scheme pops a bit more here. His robot mode
details are quite impressive at such a small scale, with little movie "metallic
shard bits" all over the place. The one exception to this is his face,
where the mold details all run into each other and thus make his face look
indistinct. His eyes are painted light blue, though, so at least that's
cleared up. For articulation, Evac can move at the shoulders (at two points),
hips, and knees, with the former two points on ball joints. If you rotate
his knees back a fair bit, though, due to his transformation, it makes
his leg look like it's splitting in half in an unnatural manner given how
the wheel hubs and the black pieces they're connected to always stay at
his knees-- which normally looks good, but in this specific instance it
is a bit of a drawback. On a smaller note, when posing his arms his chest
can inadvertently flip up as well-- I wish there was a tab or something
that hooked in the chest flap to the body. Evac can, of course, hold Cyberverse-compatible
weapons in either of his hands, and the ports on the sides of his car mode
that are now on his shoulders work well enough, though the wheels on his
knees obstruct the ports on the sides of his lower legs now, unfortunately.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    "Prime" Cyberverse Evac
is a pretty great rendition of the character for the scale, and is definitely
worth a purchase if you want this rather unique Transformer but don't want
to spend the extra cash on the
    <i>
     Transformers: The Ride
    </i>
    store-exclusive
deluxe version. It's also just a pretty neat-- if unremarkable, engineering-wise--
Cyberverse mold on its own that's actually one "up" on the deluxe version
in that it has minimal kibble issues and isn't as fiddly.

      Blistering speed and lightning-fast
reflexes make Evac more than an effective courier-- they make him a frighteningly
powerful warrior. His speed often catches Decepticons by surprise, allowing
him to strike and move before they can return fire.
