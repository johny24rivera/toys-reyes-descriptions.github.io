    Jazz' alt mode is, as
per usual, a curvy sportscar. For RID it's obviously stylized a bit, with
a bit of an oversized front section. The roof doesn't come up enough vertically
above the front hood and the rest of the car-- it doesn't look like a person
inside would have much headroom and be able to see well! Otherwise, though,
proportionally he's pretty good, and like most RID2015 toys he's got relatively
sparse mold detailing. He's got the RID2015 trademark "divots" on the front
hood and in front of the rear wheels, and a good number of mold details
on the front end, with circular headlights and a fairly angular, "mouth-like"
grill. On the back end there's some nifty little taillight and exhaust
pipe details, as well. As far as robot extras on the back end the bottoms
of the feet are rather obvious, but otherwise he's kibble-free. As with
nearly every Jazz toy, in vehicle mode his main colors are white and black,
with some blue and red stripes. It's a pretty good color scheme, overall.
The blue stripes used on this version of Jazz are just a titch darker than
usual, but I think it looks good and contrasts against the white better.
The problem is that there isn't enough paint-- the stripes on the front
hood and sides look pretty good, along with the horizontal red stripe above
the grill and the red stripes on the rear spoiler, and the front and side
windows are painted black. Howeve,r the rear window isn't painted, and
the stripes don't go along the length of the entire car mode. The back
end also has no paint, and the headlights and lower front grill also have
no paint, and those areas desperately need some to pick out those details
against all the white plastic. For a weapon, Jazz has a lance, which can
plug into a hole on the roof in this mode. It's definitely very obvious--
is Jazz into jousting in alt mode now?-- but at least there's storage for
it somewhere in this mode.

    Jazz' transformation
is pretty straightforward-- the sides become the arms, the legs fold out
from the bottom, the front section becomes the chest, and the car doors
become "shoulder wings". I like how the door wings enhance the silhouette,
though having the roof hang down behind the relatively slim lower body
is a minor downside. The biggest kibble issues deal with parts of the car
mode hanging onto the robot mode; namely the extra bits around the shoulders
and the rear sides/wheels on the sides of the lower legs especially, which
kinda ruin what are otherwise fairly straight, somewhat slim legs. Jazz'
chest is a bit overly wide and flat, but otherwise this mode looks pretty
good. I do like the proportions on the lower arms, legs (again, minus the
wheel bits) and lower body. Aesthetically it's a nice mix of curvy and
angular parts. The mold detailing is, again, fairly minimal, but the waist
and lower body have a decent number of armor-like details and look pretty
good. The head is a bit small given how wide the shoulders are, but the
sculpting itself is pretty nice. He's got the trademark Jazz black helmet
with a silver detail in the center of the forehead, but the face itself
doesn't say "Jazz" to me-- the face is silver, but he's got separate eyes.
Without a visor, Jazz just doesn't seem like Jazz-- it's too much a part
of his character. As far as colors he shares the same basic colors as in
vehicle mode, but they're broken up considerably more in this mode, with
black paint used more, along with just a better breakup of black and white
plastic. Beyond the blue stripes on the hood from vehicle mode, he's also
got some red deco bits on his shoulders and abs and blue on his kneecaps
as well. Compared to the show model, he's still missing some details on
places like his lower arms and shoulders, but overall he looks considerably
better color-wise in this mode. For articulation, Jazz can move at the
neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), inwards a bit
at the elbows, and movement at the hips, knees (at two points), and forward
a bit slightly above the ankles because of the transformation. I wish he
had waist rotation-- there's nothing in the transformation that would prevent
this-- but othewise, he's pretty articulated.

    This is the only toy
of RID2015 Jazz, so it's either this toy or nothing. Thankfully, this is
an decent mold, although it doesn't exactly break the mold in terms of
original design in either mode. There's certainly better Jazz toys that
more effectively capture his character (especially in the face), but the
mold does fit in with the RID2015 Warrior toys quite well, he's got a pretty
good color breakup at least in robot mode, and some nice articulation with
only some minor kibble issues. Mildly recommended, though I wish Hasbro
had used this slot for one of the many very unique Decepticon designs that
got zero toys in the line as opposed to another same-ish Jazz toy.
