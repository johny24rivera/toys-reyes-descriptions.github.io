    Beast mode is a rhino,
and there are no obvious clues that this is a transformer, except for the
lines in the flesh of the rhino. Again, however, this is a beast mode
that does not have many movable parts, only the mouth and back legs. The
front legs can techinically move, but this leaves a noticable gap between
them and the rest of the body if you move them into any position except
for the one shown above.

    His robot mode had WAY,
WAY too many extra rhino parts on it. They get in the way a lot and are
not easy to tuck anywhere. While tranforming, his front leg plates tend
to come of his arms, so be careful. It is very hard to snap them back on.
Also, his legs are sort of chunky in the front, but smaller in the back,
making it look odd when he is standing straight. His face can also split
apart to reveal a smaller face. His two weapons are your standard-issue
sword, which is pretty nice, and a wicked spinning chainsaw with two chainballs
attached to it.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    All in all, an okay
toy, with neat weapons, but Hasbro has made better.

      The ground shakes with a terrible thunder
as jungle trees snap like twigs. The noise draws closer in a cloud of dust
and dirt. A herd of stampeding elephants? No. It is Rhinox, defending his
territory from Predacon attackers! Courageous and cunning, has never backed
down from battle, nor been injured in any way. Not even double barreled
laser cannons can cut through his triple thick, steel plated skin! If he
comes your way, run for cover...fast!
