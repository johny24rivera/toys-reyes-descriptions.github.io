    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Legends
"G1" Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot

     You probably know the
drill by now if you've been familiar with Transformers for over a year;
this is a redeco of Starscream in mostly black, purple, and silver as Skywarp.
For the most part, this is a fairly by-the-numbers repaint; he's nearly
all black, but Skywarp does have some silver paint on his robot chest and
face, which contrasts excellently with the black, as does the metallic
bronze used on both his "real" jet cockpit and the "fake" cockpit on his
robot chest. (The bronze and silver look particularly nice together.) There's
also just a touch of really nice metallic red for his robot eyes, and his
violet Decepticon symbols also serve as nice accent colors against the
black. However, there's a bit of a mis-step with this Skywarp redeco, and
that's just how dull and dark his purple paint apps are (which are on his
thrusters, feet, lower arms, and stripes on his wings-- again, pretty by-the-numbers).
His purple paint apps are so dark that they blend in with the black too
much under anything but bright light. From a more angular view, the stripes
on his wings just "disappear" into all the black plastic, as does his other
purple paint apps; and given how dark he is already and how relatively
little bright colors there are in his jet mode in particular, this is not
at all a good thing.

     Skywarp has the same
holes in the wings as the modified version of this mold-- but he doesn't
come with the little extra null rays, which is a bit of a bummer. He's
got the negative mold changes without any of the positives, and it's not
like he's any cheaper because of this omission.

     Generations "Dollar
Store" Skywarp looks decent and at long last completes the trio of Seekers
for this mold, but I find it a disappointment. Purple and black are sort
of Skywarp's main colors; having the purple not be vibrantly contrasting
against the black makes him look relatively unpainted at many angles when
he's actually not bad in terms of number of paint apps. The other colors
are still nice enough, but as it is this is one of the few times where
