    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Blastcharge.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Blastcharge

     Blastcharge's Universe
color scheme is leaps and bounds above his Beast Machines scheme. Black,
purple, and silver may not be the most original color scheme in the world,
but that doesn't mean it rocks any less, especially on a Decepticon! And
they're all in perfect amounts, too- not too much of any one color. The
transparent blue also works well with Blastcharge's darker color scheme,
and the light orange paint apps here and there give a little bit of extra
contrast. I especially like the silver "Energon radiation" paint app used
on Blastcharge's "vehicle face"-- it's painted so that it looks like a
kind of metallic skull. And the paint app is a bit uneven, too, accentuating
the skull-face's evilness. My only real complaint about the paint job is
that, compared with the other Universe toys, Blastcharge really doesn't
have many new paint apps. The aforementioned skull-face paint app is new,
but that's about it-- everything else is just a straight pallet swap from
his Beast Machines version. Granted, the overall scheme still looks great,
and I love all the silver stripes on his back half in vehicle mode, but
it still takes away a little originality from the figure.

     No mold changes have
been made to Universe Blastcharge, though his spark crystal that was inside
his front grill on the Beast Machines version has been removed, and instead
a small Decepticon symbol has been placed on the front bumper. Can't really
say I mind taking out the spark crystal, as it was so darned hard to see
in the first place...

     Universe Blastcharge
is a GREAT repaint, though perhaps a few more paint apps that were different
from the original toy's would have made it even better. The mold itself
is still a bit of a loser in robot mode, though, so Blastcharge still isn't
exactly on the top of the Universe list, even with his nice color scheme.
