    Beast mode is a mechanical
mole. This mode looks very nice, and very fitting for such a creature as
a mole. The "nose" is actually a small drill that can turn when you turn
a wheel on the back of Mol's head! A pretty nice feature, there. Mol's
back feet are also large treads with large toes engraved on the front of
them. They are a nice touch, but I wish Hasbro would have put small wheels
on the bottom of them so that they could move. You pretty much have to
drag Mol on the ground in you want to move him. His front feet are rather
large, but very mechanical in their detailing and very fitting for Mol's
"plodding" pose. The detailing on Mol (besides the rear legs, where detailing
is comparatively scant) is very nice. There are gas pipes on the back of
his head, screwheads everywhere, and even some mechanical detailing on
the plastic UNDER the transparent red headpiece! The nice tubing and vent
detailing on the side of the rear dusted over with black looks very nice
and "worn", too. He also has tail lights on the back of his back legs,
too! Although Mol looks decidedly cute in this mode, this is okay for a
Deployer, since they're more like little helpers than actual transformers.
Sadly, Mol's articulation is very limited in this mode; he can only move
his drill-nose and his front legs in one area. Thus, Mol's posability is
extremely limited.

    Mol's weapon mode is,
well... bad. Basically you just undo a latch on Mol's beast mode, and an
automatic spring puts him up into this position, and then all you have
to do is turn his front legs 180 degrees. It's supposed to be some kind
of boring tool, but all it really looks like is Mol is shooting sawblades
out of his butt (which he is). This mode is definitely lacking in creativity.
Also, another interesting note: Although not mention in the instructions,
Mol, has little "handles" on the top of his back legs in mole mode. In
weapon mode, these can become handles for larger transformers to use to
hold him, although I honestly don't know if any Beast Machine transformer
CAN hold him, which is a rather big letdown...

    The original Mol's color
scheme (shown on the left in each of the above pictures) is pretty neat,
involving mostly a yellow and transparent red color scheme, with some black
and brown thrown into the mix as well. While this color scheme certainly
isn't bad, I think the Mol repaint's color scheme is slightly better (shown
on the right in each of the above pictures). The Mol repaint has a very
cool light green and blue color scheme, and it fits in a bit more with
a creature who tunnels in the dark. Still, both are just about as good
as the other.

    Mol is a very cool and
interesting Deployer
in beast mode, but his weapon mode is very bad. Get
the other Deployers before trying this guy out.

      Determined...deliberate...and often
depressed, this subterranean demolitions expert can bore his way into areas
where no other ally would dare tread. Recently reformatted following eons
of deactivation at the hands of the Decepticons, this always dutiful Mol
is usually called to search for organic life or to plant sophisticated
silicon-encased explosives near Vehicon emplacements. When in bore mode,
he can fire his metal tearing, serrated circular blade at attacking Vehicons
with circuit slicing accuracy. He projects a negative attitude that makes
his fellow Maximals a bit uneasy. Not exactly "the life of the party,"
but reliable to a fault.
