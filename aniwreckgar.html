    Hi there, fellow Internet-traveler!
I am Wreck-Gar! I am a hero! I am also a transforming garbage truck-- after
all, I am good for only one thing, GARBAGE! In my alternate mode, I am
pretty small for a Voyager class toy, but I am also pretty compact! Even
for an Animated toy, though, I don't have much mold detailing-- wait, is
that a bad thing? *listens to Beastbot's whispers* Ah, okay. It is a bad
thing, as I look rather "kiddy" in this mode, almost like I am a toy from
Fisher-Price (whatever that is)! However, I have no robot extras showing
at all in this mode, though I don't have much clearance for my tires! My
main "gimmick" in this mode involves pulling back on the black tab on the
back of each of my garbage can levers, which will then make the front halves
of the levers rotate upwards to "throw trash" into my back compartment!
My back compartment isn't open for trash, though-- it houses my robot mode
weapons-- so instead I just throw trash all down my sides! It's awesome!
My color scheme consists mostly of orange, red, and gray, with some black,
and is very reminiscent of my G1 version! (I have a G1 version?!) My colors
go together alright, but they're nothing to stare at! I have a fair number
of paint applications, though the top of my back half has no paint at all,
which makes it look rather bland!

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    As is evident from my
transformation, I, Wreck-Gar, am a total shell-former in robot mode! Almost
my entire robot mode is hidden under or in the back half of my vehicle
mode, and almost my entire vehicle mode is on my back in robot mode! Only
four of my wheels and my front bumper are shared between both of my modes
(and the bumper makes for a swell chest, I must say-- or must I?)! Having
almost my entire alt mode on my back causes me to be rather back-heavy
in robot mode, and makes me hard to stand up in this mode-- plus, my garbage-lifters
stick out from below my waist and look really unsightly! (Alternatively,
if you fold them up, it makes me even more back-heavy, so Beastbot does
not recommend that!) My general robot mode proportions are very good, though,
and fit Animated's style perfectly-- particularly in my legs, which have
the trademark Animated "angular curve" to them! My face sculpt is also
top-notch, with the expression fitting my hilariously nieve personality
perfectly and homaging my G1 self at the same time! Plus, it looks like
I have an old TV for a head! How awesome is that? Beastbot tells me it
is very awesome, which makes me wonder why he just told me to ask you!
My articulation is also pretty good, as I am able to move at the neck (at
two points), shoulders (at three points), elbows, at the base of the four
fingers of each of my hands (with all four fingers on each hand on one
hinge), and at the hips (at three points) and knees (at two points)! Unfortunately,
as I said earlier, I am so back-heavy this limits my poses a lot in spite
of this! My main gimmick in this mode involves blade-like weapons that
pop out of my back and attach to my lower arms so I can RUN WITH SCISSORS!
Beastbot isn't sure if that homage to this "Weird Al" person was intentional
or not, but he loves it regardless!

    I am Wreck-Gar! I am
a mediocre Transformer! Though I am a great homage to the G1 toy and this
"Weird Al" fellow, I also have very little mold detailing, am sort of small
for a Voyager, am backheavy, and am a total shellformer! Still, if you
are a Weird Al fan or just a fan of my character, Beastbot still mildly
recommends me because of my personality!

      Wreck-Gar means well. All he really
wants to do is help folks in need. Unfortunately, he's a terrible judge
of character, and happily helps anyone who asks without thinking about
what he's doing. He has accidentally robbed a few banks, and blasted an
Autobot here and there. His Spark is in the right place anyway. Now that
he's clear on the difference between the Autobots and the Decepticons,
misunderstandings like that should happen less often.
