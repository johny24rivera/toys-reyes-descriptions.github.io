    Even though he doesn't
make even a brief appearance in the movie, Jolt's gotten a brand-new deluxe
mold for the Dark of the Moon toyline. He's still a Chevrolet Volt electric
car, and his proportions in car mode are still spot-on (as you'd expect
them to be on a toy with a licensed vehicle mode)-- really, I can't find
anything to complain about here in that respect. The only real robot extras
are visible inside the windows, and even then there's not anything blatantly
obvious like a head or a hand right next to a window, so though I would've
preferred if Jolt had had tinted windows, it still isn't that big of a
deal. My biggest beef with Jolt in this mode has to do with color scheme
(which, as you'd expect, carries over to his robot mode as well). Namely,
it's been changed to mostly a couple variations of gray and black-- something
the movie line absolutely does NOT need any more of, particularly for what
is essentially an off-screen character this time. If the bluish gray used
for most of the car mode had more blue than gray in it, it would probably
look pretty decent, but as it is, it's just an incredibly dull color scheme.
There's some attempt to set it apart with a couple of neat electric blue
line designs along the side doors and the sides of the front windshield,
but these blend in with the bluish gray plastic too easily (though they
look pretty nice against the transparent plastic). Keeping Jolt's dark
blue color scheme from his previous toy would've worked wonders here, though
at least the "carbon fiber" detailing on Jolt's roof is painted all black
this time around to help break up all that gray a little. (The light red
used for the taillights also contrasts very well against the gray, but
it's an accent color at best, unfortunately.) Jolt has two Mechtech ports,
one on each side of his roof. His actual Mechtech weapon is pretty average--
it's a black-and-electric-blue-colored weapon that transforms from a gun
with a small nozzle to a gun with a larger nozzle if you push backward
on the top lever. Like most Mechtech weapons, however, it automatically
converts back to its original "small nozzle" configuration as soon as you
let go of the lever, which is rather dumb.

    A bit of a PSA before
I move onto a full review of Jolt's robot mode-- although otherwise his
transformation is of average difficulty compared to other deluxe-class
Mechtech toys, be careful unfolding Jolt's head out of its alcove. The
second time I transformed him, I was a bit too careless and the long center
crest on Jolt's forehead snapped off, as I had pushed it through the wrong
way (which is quite easy to do)-- so double-check the instructions if you're
unsure, people. This is the reason why I have a stock image of Jolt's robot
mode above instead of one taken by me.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Jolt's robot mode is
generally quite impressive, particularly when compared to his
    <a href="rotfjolt.html">
     previous
deluxe toy
    </a>
    and compared with the brief screen time his movie model
got in the second movie. The proportions are MUCH more accurate, from his
chicken-walker legs with the large feet to the "wings" on the back formed
by his car pieces (a very cool touch, I think) to the more accurate claws
at the end of his arms. The mold detailing was already decent enough in
his car mode-- showing stuff like his license plate and carbon-fiber roofing--
but on his robot parts it's particularly good, with stuff like pistons
and gears all over the place, particularly on his arms and upper legs.
His headsculpt is quite movie-accurate too, and I love how the halves of
his rear bumper angle across his chest to give it that "fragmented" look
of the movie aesthetic. The only thing that gets me about Jolt in this
mode-- besides the color scheme, which I've already discussed-- are the
arms. They're rather oddly articulated at the elbows, making pretty much
any pose with them look a bit weird. In addition, there's nothing pegging
his shoulders to his main body, and considering that they rest on a slightly
floppy hinge, this is a big oversight. I mean, all it would take is ONE
peg for each arm to go into the body and everything would be set here--
given all the little details everywhere else, why was this rather vital
bit left out? It wouldn't even take any extra plastic pieces, and is the
only rather glaring engineering flaw with Jolt here. As for articulation,
Jolt's got you covered-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points),
elbows (at two points), hips, knees (at three points), and ankles (at two
points). He also has a port on the lower part of each arm for a Mechtech
weapon-- though unfortunately he doesn't have his signature whip weapons
this time around.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Dark of the Moon Jolt--
engineering-wise-- is a noticeable step up from his previous deluxe toy
mold, with not only a great car mode this time, but a fantastic, unique,
movie-accurate robot mode. Unfortunately, two bizarre decisions drag him
down a bit-- his overly dull color scheme and the lack of anything to connect
his shoulders to his main body in robot mode-- but other than that, he's
an engineering treat. Highly recommended.

      Jolt does not know the meaning of the
world "calm". His body pulses with more energy than an Energon reactor
in a Cybertronian summer. The high-ranking Autobots have attempted to teach
Jolt patience and restraint, but he has yet to learn. Loyal to the end,
Jolt fights on the front line of any skirmish with the Decepticons.
