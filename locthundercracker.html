Thundercracker's vehicle mode is spot-on compared to the larger version,
at least when it comes to the jet parts on the top. The proportions are
exactly the same in jet mode in all respects when compared to the larger
version, and the colors are pretty much the same as well, but without the
orange detailing on the wings, which probably wouldn't look good at this
small scale anyways. There is considerably more robot parts baggage on
the underside on this mode when compared to the larger version, however--
the robot legs and arms stick out pretty clearly from the underside, and
the tops of the arms even stick out in front of the wings from even a top
view. The robot feet are also rather visible on the rear end of the vehicle
mode. At least he partially makes up for it with having an extra gun below
the cockpit that the larger version doesn't, though...

     LoC Thundercracker's
robot mode is actually better than the larger version in nearly all respects
except the slightly diminished mold and paint detailing that comes with
the scale, and the articulation. (LoC Thundercracker's articulation is
limited to his shoulders and hips, though his arm-mounted gun can swivel
on a joint as well.) This toy's proportions are significantly improved
over the larger version's, with the arms being less lanky and certainly
not having the problem of coming unhinged from the main body, for one.
He also actually has TWO HANDS in this version, with his gun instead being
permanently attached to the top of one arm instead of actually being the
arm. (This does mean that there's a little extra plane shell behind Thundercracker's
head, but if you don't mind having a long skinny piece of plastic hanging
behind his back, you can fold it back to make LoC Thundercracker look a
bit more like his larger version in that respect.) The legs are also MUCH
better-looking, no longer being absurdly skinny and actually being a bit
longer proportionally as well.

     LoC Thundercracker's
vehicle mode does have a bit more kibble than his larger version, but he
more than makes up for it by having excellent proportions in robot mode,
something that the deluxe toy certainly doesn't have. For his pricepoint,
he's actually a better toy than the larger Thundercracker, in my opinion.
He doesn't have the playability that the larger one does, however, given
his very limited articulation, so consider that before deciding whether
you want to purchase this LoC toy or not.
