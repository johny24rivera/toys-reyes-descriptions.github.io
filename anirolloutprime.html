    Roll Out &amp; Command
Optimus Prime's vehicle mode is a bit "kiddy" looking, even taking the
Animated aesthetic into account. The lack of mold detailing really shows
through on a toy this large, and Hasbro didn't take advantage of the large
scale by giving him doors or a more complex transformation. In fact, surprisingly,
his transformation is considerably SIMPLER than most of his other toys--
more on that later. The color scheme is definitely Optimus, with gray,
dark blue, black, and red being the main colors, so no complaints there.
However, the rear section of the vehicle mode is way too short proportionally,
and the feet are way too obvious sticking out the rear end-- honestly,
you're telling me that at this scale they couldn't have figured out a better
way to hide the feet? The huge axe is a bit of an eyesore in this mode
as well, since it's just RIGHT THERE behind the truck cab. The main body
of the truck is pretty good proportionally, however, with the windows and
headlights molded particularly well. The front bumper sticks out a tad
more than it does on most of the other toys, but that's a minor beef. His
arms also don't peg into the sides of the truck mode well, either-- a side
effect of Optimus Prime's "Roll Out" gimmick. As for electronics, if you
roll Prime forward on a flat surface, you're hear a "truck moving" noise,
and the headlights will blink yellow. Press the Autobot symbol in the center
of the front of this mode, and you'll hear in Optimus' voice say either
"Let's go!" or "Roll out!" (yes, the actor from the show has done the voice
clips for this toy). As far as Optimus Prime's MAIN gimmick, there's a
tab on the front of the bumper. Switched into one place, the vehicle mode
is "locked", and you can roll it along without anything happening. Switch
the tab to its other position, and as you move the truck forward, the cab
part of the toy will transform itself into robot mode by spinning around
several times and slowly revealing itself, though you'll still have to
transform the legs (though it's little more than lengthening the legs,
rotating them down, and then fiddling with the wheels a bit). The gimmick
also works in reverse-- by moving the vehicle backwards, it'll transform
its robot upper half back into the truck cab. It's a neat idea, but honestly
it loses its novelty after a few times, simply because the cab part has
to spin MANY times before it's full transformed-- just two or three spins
would've worked much better, me thinks. When he reaches his fully revealed
robot pose as far as the cab is concerned, he'll say "Roll out!" to let
you know he's done transforming. (If it starts clicking, that's another
sign it's done.)

    Optimus Prime's robot
mode is definitely better than his vehicle mode, but it still has enough
problems where it's questionable whether this toy is really worht $50.
For one, there's a huge bumper hanging off of Optimus' butt, and the sirens
just hang behind his head without folding away neatly. His arms are also
extremely limited in articulation due to the gimmicks-- you can move his
left arm forward as a whole to hear a "punch" sword, followed occasionally
by a "ha HA!", but that seems an awful lot to sacrifice for a lame sound
gimmick. His right arm you can lift up and then let it go for an "axe slicing"
sound, but otherwise there's no shoulder articulation in that arm. The
elbow can move at one point on that arm, but the axe Prime carries is heavy
enough to cause the ratcheting joint to not support the weight fairly easily.
Prime also can't turn his head-- inexcusable at this scale-- though the
head sculpt is done fairly well, and it houses my favorite gimmick of the
entire toy. Press in on the Autobot symbol on his chest in this mode, and
he'll say either "My name is Optimus Prime" or "Bring it on!" The cool
bit about this, though, is that his faceplate moves not just as he talks,
but
    <i>
     in the exact motions that fit with what he's saying
    </i>
    . That's
just awesome. Prime's lower half doesn't suffer from the gimmicks in this
mode, though-- the proportions are pretty spot-on, and he can move at the
waist, hips (at two points, and knees (at two points). As far as Prime's
axe goes, when you press in on a small grey tab on the handle, a translucent
orange flame piece will pop out the back and two transparent blue pieces
will slide out and "extend" the axe, which is admittedly pretty cool, though
the handle for the axe is MUCH too short.

    Roll Out &amp; Command
Optimus Prime is a fairly decent-looking toy in robot mode, but most of
his gimmicks are overly obtrusive, he has a severely overly simplistic
transformation and look for the high price point, and his vehicle mode
is one of the weakest out of any of his toys. Only recommended for small
kids who play really hard with their toys and prefer gimmicks over posablility
(and who aren't low on money), or completists. Otherwise, get one of the
smaller Animated Primes, they're much better.

      Though he is young, Optimus Prime is
one of the mightiest warriors ever to come from Cybertron. Sworn to defend
life and freedom no matter what its form, he has taken the AllSpark, Earth
and its people under his personal protection. Megatron and his crew of
evil Decepticons will stop at nothing to capture the AllSpark and conquer
the universe, but Optimus Prime and the Autobots that follow him will never
surrender. They will never stop fighting until Earth and Cybertron are
safe.
