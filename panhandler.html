not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Sledge. For a

     Pan-Handler is a rather
odd name for any Transformer. Is this a beggar Transformer or something?
Anyways, Pan-Handler's primary colors are black and a pale light blue that
used as the main contrast color. It's certainly not a bad color combo per
se, but the blue is a touch too bland and light for my liking. It's also
just not all that fitting for a construction vehicle, honestly. However,
the silver paint apps on the windows do look fairly nice against the blue.
What I'm really bummed didn't get more "exposure" on Pan-Handler here is
the dull periwinkel used on the top of the piece that becomes his right
shoulder. Not only does it go quite well with both the blue AND the black,
but personally I wish it and the lighter blue had switched places on this
figure. It's a really attractive shade of blue, and gives enough contrast
against the black to make a fine main color while also not being so bland
like the plastic light blue. I also would've liked some paint apps on the
robot legs-- they really need some amongst all that black. Of note is that
though Pan-Handler's packaging has him listed as a Decepticon, there are
no such allegiance symbols on him.

     Pan-Handler here is
an awful mold with the worst paint job that the toy has had among his various
U.S. release. There's no real reason for anyone to buy this guy except
a Minicon completist.
