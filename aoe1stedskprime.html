    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE First
Edition Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Optimus Prime's "Silver
Knight" form gets a big, articulated toy for the Target exclusive subline--
only, it's the larger but slightly inferior First Edition form of the toy
and not the
     <a href="aoeleadprime.html">

     . Still,
in vehicle mode this new paint scheme is a beaut-- the entire nose and
body of the truck is COATED with either silver paint or rather extensive
flame paint apps that are a bit more extensive than on the original First
Edition release. I'm not one for big allegiance symbols, but the big Autobot
symbol on the roof does actually look nice surrounded by all that silver
paint. The chrome is also on pretty much every place that it was on the
original First Edition toy except for the shoulders, which furthers the
whole "Silver Knight" thing in robot mode. (Fair warning, though; the red
paint on the chrome front grill can chip off rather easily, though I haven't
had any problems with the chrome itself.) He's also got some nice metallic
gunmetal gray paint on his chest, shoulders, and faceplate, and a silver-painted
head with light blue eyes. Additionally, he's got some extra flame paint
apps painted on his chrome chest. The transparent plastic on the original
has been switched from yellow to a more Autobot-y light blue, and looks
better than the yellow (in my opinion) on the weapons in particular, and
it contrasts well with the silver/gray. There's also a bit of light red
and dark blue paint and plastic on a few areas of the robot mode-- such
as legs and parts of the ankles, elbows, and shoulders-- that helps to
break up the robot mode a bit more and add some more color to make him
less monochromatic. If all that I just mentioned to you was the full description
of the toy, I'd actually rate this above the original-- all that silver
paint, and a rare genuinely new color scheme for Prime, looks great! However,
there is one big downer here, and that's that the bottom section of the
vehicle mode and many of the parts of the robot mode are NOT silver-painted,
but instead that blah, light milky gray plastic that's used far too much
on TFs as is. And there are LARGE sections of the gray that are completely
uninterrupted, such as the entire back third or so of the vehicle mode--
indeed, pick him up in that mode and look at him from the underside and
you can get a sense of just how much unpainted gray plastic there is. If
they didn't have the budget to completely dip the toy in silver paint for
this exclusive release, at least using a more metallic shade of plastic
would've worked-- but nope, there's just that blah gray there instead.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Silver Knight Optimus Prime.

     The "First Edition"
version of Silver Knight Optimus Prime has an impressive amount of paint
on it on the front of the vehicle mode and a more original color scheme
for Optimus than is usually found on redecos of him nowadays. However,
despite all the silver and red and gunmetal gray paint and all the silver
chrome, having such large pieces of him being uninterrupted blah light
milky gray plastic-- instead of being painted or a more interesting, metallic
shade of gray-- hurts the toy more than you'd think. As such, I'd recommend
the original release of the mold over this version-- unless you want both
the Leader class mold AND this mold, but also want this mold to look "more
different" on a shelf.
