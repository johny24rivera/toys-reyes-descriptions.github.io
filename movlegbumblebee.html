    Bumblebee's Legends class
toy is of his old '70s Camaro form in the movie, though it's missing the
"burnt spots" that the deluxe version has. In fact, in general he's rather
lacking in paint apps-- he really could have used some on his tail lights,
for instance. And what irks me is that his rear window isn't painted at
all, but his racing stripes are actually painted OVER said rear window!
Talk about not paying attention to the mold detailing (what little there
is that's visible in this mode...). The proportions to this mode are pretty
good for the most part, with two exceptions, one major one minor. The minor
exception is that his robot feet are rather obvious sticking out of the
back end of this mode. The major exception is the very noticeable square
bumps on the sides of his vehicle mode behind the front tires. More blatantly
obvious toy joints I haven't seen in quite a while, and they definitely
ruin the otherwise fairly smooth look of the mode.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
also suffers quite a bit from being in such a small scale, unfortunately.
To put it bluntly, he looks fat-- his car chest reeeally hangs out there,
but it sticks out in front of where his stomach would be, not his chest.
Plus, his lower legs are pretty chubby and soft-looking, especially when
viewed from a side angle where it looks like his legs have ballooned to
three times their original width, what with his teeny tiny feet and all.
Plus, his arms are just really weird, even taking into account the limitations
of the size class-- his feet are molded on the bottom of his headlight
pieces, which looks odd, and his elbows bend, but IN THE WRONG DIRECTION--
he can bend his elbows BACKWARDS, but can't move them forwards, and there's
no reason for it to be this way due to his design or anything. (Bumblebee's
other points of articulation include his shoulders and hips-- slightly
below-average for a Legends toy.) On the plus side, however, Bumblebee's
mold detailing is much better in this mold, especially on his waist and
head, and he has more paint apps which show through to give him less of
a plain appearance.

    Movie Legends Bumblebee
is one of the worst Movie Legends class figures, with pretty big flaws
in both modes-- in robot mode, it's his chunkiness and odd arm construction,
and in vehicle mode it's the lack of detailing and the really noticeable
blocks on the sides of the mode. Unless you're a really big fan of these
little toys or of Bumblebee, just get the

    version instead if you want an "old" Movie Bumblebee.
