    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Legends Starscream.

     I'll be honest, I'm starting
to run out of original things to say about Thundercracker repaints of Starscream
molds, given how often it's been done. This Legends-class Thundercracker
(the "new" Legends class, which is bigger than the "old" Legends class,
which has been re-named Legion class) very much follows the usual Thundercracker
repaint MO. Dark blue and black are his main colors, with some silver paint
along the intake vents and main body, along with some red and white stripes
on his wings. No surprises there, and the particular shades of most of
the colors are typical. The cockpit is painted a nice pale shade of bronze--
slightly different from the usual gold, but not enough to really make it
look uniquely different. There are two slightly unique tweaks to his usual
colors, however. The first is that much of Thundercracker's blue on the
"unpaintable" plastic in his robot mode-- his ball joints, upper arms,
upper legs, and the like-- are of a bit of a paler color, which doesn't
look as good as the more straightforward dark blue plastic on the rest
of him. On the other hand, the red paint used for his stripes in jet mode
is of a really nice metallic shade that gives the jet mode a bit more sparkle,
so the negative and positive here tend to cancel each other out.

     No mold changes have
been made to CW Legends Thundercracker, though as with the other Combiner
Wars redecos of Generations "Thrilling 30th" molds, he doesn't come with
any little partner figure despite being the same price. This makes him
look like he's missing something compared to Starscream and
     <a href="genacidstorm.html">

     , particularly since he still has that obvious hole on the top
of his jet mode.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Beyond a rather nice
shade of metallic red on the wings, Combiner Wars Legends-class Thundercracker
really doesn't offer anything unique to the usual Thundercracker color
scheme-- you likely already knew where you stood on whether you were going
to buy this figure or not as soon as you found out about its existence.
Having it in hand won't change your opinion on that one way or the other--
as is usual, I rank his colors better than Starscream's, but not as good
as Skywarp's.
