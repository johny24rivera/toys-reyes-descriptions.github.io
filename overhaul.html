    Overhaul's vehicle mode
is a futuristic 4-wheel drive SUV-- he's the only Jungle Planet transformer
that isn't a beast (primarily for story purposes). But, of course, a rough-n-tough
vehicle like this still fits right at home in a jungle planet. The proportions
in this mode are overall pretty good (though the wheels are a tad large),
and he fits very solidly together, so no worries about him coming apart
during rough play. The only real robot extras in this mode are his "
    <a href="wolverine.html">
     Wolverine
    </a>
    "-style
claws on the rear end, but these blend in with the overall shape of the
vehicle mode to keep it from being anything more than a minor problem.
He has some good paint detailing-- I especially like the gold lines on
the front and sides of this mode-- and his mold detailing is decent, though
it's a bit sparse on the front hood. I'm not fond of the red windows, however--
those always look hokey, I'm not sure why Hasbro continues to do that so
often with Transformers lately. It gives Overhaul a bit more of a "kiddy"
look in this mode than he otherwise would have had. But overall, the color
scheme of jungle green, black, and tannish orange goes together perfectly
for an SUV stranded on the Jungle Planet. One thing that I think is kind
of cool about this mode that was probably unintentional is the way the
back shaft of the missile juts out of the rear of the vehicle-- it makes
it look like Overhaul's gaining some speed, with a bit of flame shooting
out his exhaust port. True, he doesn't HAVE an exhaust port molded on his
backside, but it still looks kinda cool.

    Overhaul's robot mode
has some good parts to it, but overall it's not nearly as good as his vehicle
mode. His upper legs are rather skinny, while his lower legs are far too
bulky in comparison, and his windshield bits jut out from his knees far
enough to actually get in the way of arm movement in certain positions.
And, even though the rest of his body has good articulation, his arms are
articulated in a very odd manner at the elbows-- they can only move back-and-forth,
but with the way Overhaul's lower arms are molded in such a curved position,
he can't point his hands at any angle except inwards. And given that there's
nothing in Overhaul's transformation to prevent him from having ball joints
on his elbows, it's pretty annoying that such limited movement was given
to him there. I'm also not a big fan of how his shoulder pads-- made up
of the side doors of his vehicle mode- stick out from his body at a diagonal
angle, while they would have looked much better resting on the top of his
shoulder like
    <a href="enironhide.html">
     Energon
Ironhide's
    </a>
    . His Cyber
Key gimmick is also a bit annoying-- if you insert his key into his back,
a missile from his chest fires. Now, that's not so bad, BUT you cannot
insert the key without firing the missile, and there's nowhere else to
store it. So you're always stuck either keeping track of the Cyber Key
or the missile, as they can't both be inserted into Overhaul at the same
time. Overhaul does have a bit of personality in this mode, however-- he's
pretty much what Wolverine would look like if he were a Transformer. Overhaul's
got the same three sharp claws on the back of his hands for some slashin'
action, plus his face, though rather square, has an angry, no-nonsense
look to it-- the personality inherent in his look is definitely his main
selling point in this mode.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Overhaul has a nice
vehicle mode, but his robot mode has some definite problems, like his odd
arm articulation and the windshields hanging off his knees, among others.
He's not the worst there is in the Cybertron line, but there's many better
toys in the line that're worthy of your purchase before this guy.

      One tough Autobot, Overhaul has never
thought much of intellectual pursuits. His solution to a complex problem
is generally to stomp on it until it gets simple or stops being a problem.
He's never felt that he's had the respect his strength deserves from the
other Autobots, but now that he's on the Jungle Planet -- where might makes
right -- he feels right at home.
