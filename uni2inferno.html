    Inferno's vehicle mode
is a quite realistic fire truck, though what makes it closer to Inferno's
Generation 2 version as opposed to his
    <a href="g1inferno.html">
     Generation

    </a>
    is the inclusion of a "water cannon" (which can fire a spring-loaded
projectile) instead of the traditional ladder. Inferno is covered with
detailing in this mode (where appropriate), with little panels, "bolts",
"pistons", and the links covering the sides of his form. He also has molded-in
exhaust pipes on the back end, and a good amount of paint detailing on
him with such details as the "401/Fire Rescue" emblems and the white angled
stripes working well against the red and brown-- it's not exactly the most
exciting color scheme in the world, but it's realistic and gets the job
done. His transparent windshield lets you see two seats inside, and the
headlights and sirens are transparent as well (though the sirens are clear
plastic, which is a slight bummer). I'm also not a fan of how two of the
windows on each side of Inferno are black as opposed to the clear plastic
of the front windshield-- it looks weird, either make all the windows transparent
or don't, but I'm not fond of the middle ground. Still, all of these are
pretty minor complaints. There's one that I have for this mode that isn't,
however, and that's that you can see the arms and the soles of the feet
from the robot mode quite clearly from a top view. Granted, they fit in
with the overall shape of the fire truck seamlessly, but the detailing
makes them unmistakable to anyone who's accustomed to Transformers. The
only thing "covering them up" is the aforementioned water cannon (which
can rotate at its base or swivel up and down), and that's not enough.

    On its surface, Inferno's
robot mode is good, but fairly unremarkable. Broken down to basics, he's
got the well-worn transformation of folding and spreading out all the limbs
and head around the front of the vehicle mode to form the robot mode, and
his chest is rather wide and flat as a result of this, which doesn't look
too hot even if it is a throwback to his traditional design. However, there's
lots of "little touches" that, when taken together, really make Inferno
quite a good figure. The way all of his vehicle mode panels tuck into small
panels on the backs of his lower arms and behind his shoulders is really
quite ingeious, and in this configuration they barely impede any movement
at all. In fact, for a design like this his articulation in general is
quite remarkable-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at four points),
elbows, wrists, hips (at three points), knees (at two points), and the
ankles. Much of this articulation wasn't at all necessary, but it's stil
there via nice touches-- how his shoulders can move backwards where they
meet the body, how his wrists can rotate, his hips can rotate upward slightly
where they meet the body, how the ankles are on nice, rather unique joints
that give them almost free reign in regards to movement, how his kneecaps
stick with the lower legs so that when he's bending the legs they still
look rather "solid"-- even having a few of these unique movements is unusual,
but Inferno has them all. It definitely appears that quite a lot of thought
went into making this figure as articulated as possible. I'm also fond
of how a little panel comes up and fits into place on his upper back so
that you can't see all the way through his transparent chest out his back.
His robot head sculpt is also quite good and pretty much spot-on G1 accurate,
and the pistons in his feet are really nice details. Inferno's water cannon
now rests underneath his right arm in this mode-- unfortunately it can't
detach and allow him to hold it in his hands, but that's a small quibble.
I also don't like how the front bumper from vehicle mode just sorta flips
down-- it just inteferes with leg movement a little and doesn't look much
like anything, so what's the point?

is the only original Voyager mold for the line, and it's a pretty good
one. The basic design isn't innovative, but several little touches that
give him quite a good range of motion in robot mode and eliminate stuff
like being able to see all the way through his chest in robot mode almost
elevate him to the "must-buy" rating of 9.0+. The only things that keep
him from getting there are his overly wide, flat chest in robot mode and
his fairly obvious arms and feet in vehicle mode.

      Though search and rescue is his primary
function-- and one he happens to be very good at-- Inferno loves nothing
more than a good fight. In fact, he will often abandon his duties or even
ignore direct orders, just to go antagonize Decepticons. He especially
loves to get up close to his enemies, where the energy-damping field he
generates to help suppress fires can eliminate the effectiveness of their
weapons. He uses the chemical foam sprayed from his arm cannon to blind
opponents as often as he uses it to put out fires.
