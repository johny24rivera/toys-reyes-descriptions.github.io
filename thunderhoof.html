    Thunderhoof's tractor
mode is replicated very well for his Warrior form, though the proportions
are a bit different than on most of his other toys. (They're not BAD, just
different.) He's definitely not as proportionally wide as on most of his
other toys, and as a whole the tractor mode just looks a bit more compact.
The front thresher section looks much more proportional and realistic than
on his other versions, with the sections longer and more "pointy"-- though
there's a definite gap in the middle of this front section, due to the
transformation. As far as robot mode extras, the top front section of this
mode is obviously detailed like his robot chest and not the front hood
of a tractor, but the general shape still fits. Otherwise, there's no robot
mode extras at all in this mode; it's very solid. As far as the mold detailing
goes, he's slightly above-average for a RID2015 toy. There's certainly
some areas of somewhat sparse detailing-- like the lower sides-- but all
of the windows are detailed into the mold, along with another smaller set
of side windows near the back; rear windows; smokestacks; rear-view windows;
treads on the wheels; and a back bumper/vent section. In regards to the
general color scheme, it fits in with the general scheme of other Thunderhoof
toys, with a somewhat dark blue and black being the two main colors, with
the black breaking up all the blue fairly well in this mode so that there's
few large areas of just one color on the toy. The blue plastic has a fair
amount of glitter in it, making it semi-metallic, which is always a nice
twist on things and looks good. There's some black paint on the front hood,
smokestacks, part of the roof, and rear side windows, and a nice light
shade of blue on the front hood and window (though unfortunately only the
front window). By far the biggest color issue with this mode is that there's
angular sections of black plastic crossing right around the front side
windows, which looks REALLY odd and should have been mostly painted over
or at least changed to blue plastic like all the surrounding pieces. There
also isn't any paint on the back end, which is a bit of a shame as there's
plenty of details back there. There IS just a titch of fairly dark red
on the front headlights, which contrasts with the blue pretty well and
I wish was used a bit more on the toy.

    The transformation to
Thunderhoof's robot mode is a bit more complex than most Warrior toys (though
still not what I would consider difficult), with the back sides forming
the arms, the front sides folding out and forward to form his legs, and
the roof and front hood hinging and connecting together to form the chest.
Of course, the thresher forms Thunderhoof's head, with the bits angling
towards each other a bit to look more like antlers-- and they look like
pretty dangerous antlers, as he could definitely spear you on them. His
facesculpt is pretty decent with a silver face and dark red eyes, but the
head itself is a bit overly bulky, given that it also has to include a
hinge to move the thresher bits further back behind his head from the tractor
mode. It's not a huge issue, but it does look a titch odd. Additionally,
there's no real "back" to Thunderhoof's main body; you've got the front
made up of the aforementioned top of the tractor, and some hinge parts
behind that front section formed from the "core" of the toy and part of
the transformation, but there's no actual back there, which can look a
bit odd with a more side-on view. Other than that, Thunderhoof is quite
well done here. The wheels work excellently as big, buff shoulders, and
the lower arms made up of part of the rear sections are pretty proportional
(i.e., a little beefy). The smokestacks jutting out below his hands make
for nice hand blasters, too. The legs are pretty well-sculpted with the
lower legs extended by the transformation, with Thunderhoof's hooves molded
in a a slightly diagonal manner so he can make an "A" stance, and with
some stylized angular details on the rest of the lower legs. In an uneeded
but cool addition, there's some tread-like details on the bottom of his
feet, too. He's also got some (needed) black paint on the hooves, as well
as some light blue paint on the lower legs and a bit of red on the kneecaps.
The chest is also well-detailed, too. For articulation, Thunderhoof can
move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, inwards at the wrists,
rotation at the waist, movement at the hips, knees (at two points), and
slightly back-and-forth a bit above the ankles due to the transformation.
He's well-balanced, he can get into some REALLY nice poses because of this.
For a weapon, Thunderhoof comes with a cool shotgun with little antlers
on it-- it's quite a unique accessory, which plugs underneath the middle
of his alt mode for storage.

    He has a few minor issues--
namely the lack of a back in robot mode and an odd big patch of black right
in the middle of the sides of his alt mode-- but that aside, warrior Thunderhoof
is a very solid toy and definitely the best toy of the character released.
He's very well-proportioned, unique, has an interesting transformation
and alt mode, a cool weapon, and is very well-articulated and poseable.
Highly recommended.
