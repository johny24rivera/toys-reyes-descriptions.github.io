    Megatron's vehicle mode
is, obviously, a Cybertronian vehicle-- some sort of futurisitic VTOL...
thing. Compared to the deluxe-sized
    <a href="battlebegins.html">
     "Battle
Begins"
    </a>
    version of him, it's mostly an improvement in that it looks
a little less like a robot taking yoga. It's still hard to tell which way
is the darned front (it's facing towards the camera, but there's no real
way to tell this from the toy), and there still are a few telltale signs
like the obvious feet and the arms under the rear end, but they're covered
up SLIGHTLY better this time around. Parts peg into each other a bit better
this time around as well (with the exception of the front... fin... things,
which still just don't want to stay together for long). His wings are slightly
more obvious, but still horribly undersized. The overall color scheme of
black, light gray, and translucent red still works roughly as well, though
the gray itself can be a bit dull (though it's no prominent in this mode,
so that's for later). As expected from an Animated toy, there's not much
mold detailing, but there still are some cool details, like the translucent
red "turbines" and the rear of the gun, which has a nice mix of black and
silver paint with some translucent red lines showing through. One advantage
the smaller "Battle Begins" toy has over this mold, though, is that it
doesn't have a really large unsightly plastic hinge reaching around one
side of the gun-- that's a bit of an eyesore.

    Megatron's robot mode
is a bit of an improvement over his vehicle, but disappointingly it still
has some major flaws, even give the questionable vehicle mode. The biggest
and most annoying one is that his fusion cannon, as enormous as it is,
is attached to his right arm THE WRONG WAY. And it's molded this way, so
it's not just some assembly error. It would take some serious modding to
correct this-- as it is, it hangs down below his arm in a rather awkward
manner. Oh, yeah, and the peg that holds it to the main body is weak, so
the cannon falls off almost constantly. GROAN. The cannon can fire your
standard spring-loaded missile, however, and the translucent red parts
on both sides can be folded over onto one side to serve as a sort of cannon-blade.
Megatron also has a rather major proportion problem when it comes to his
legs, Animated aesthetic or not-- his upper legs are ridiculously small
compared to his relatively huge lower legs-- his kneecaps practically cover
them up from a head-up view, which means it sort of looks like Megatron
has no upper legs at all from some angles. On the plus side, he's quite
stable (his feet are molded at a slight angle so he can take a normal stance
without his legs sliding out from under him), and his upper body proportions
are spot-on. There's also no vehicle mode kibble, though the kneecaps are
a tad large and awkward. Megatron's head sculpt is also very well-done,
though for some odd reason it's darker than the light gray used for the
rest of his upper body-- it's the other way around on the show model, with
his face being a lighter gray. He has a fair amount of black "line" detailing,
though he still could use more, particularly on his upper chest and arms.
The translucent red is used to really nice effect in this mode, particularly
on the blade and lower waist. Another detail I like about the toy is the
"samurai"-like "skirt" he has on-- it gives him a bit more character, methinks.
Megatron's articulation is pretty good-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at three points), elbows (at two points), wrists, waist, hips (at two
points), and knees (at two points). All of the joints are nice and tight,
as well. However, his legs can't be posed as much as you'd think, due to
the aforementioned HUGE lower legs.

    Overall, if you want
one Animated Megatron mold, go for the
    <a href="animegatron.html">
     Leader
class toy
    </a>
    . If you want one Animated Cybertron Mode Megatron, go for
"The Battle Begins" 2-pack. Not only does the Megatron in that 2-pack cheaper,
but he has a more accurate color scheme and a better robot mode with a
FAR less annoying fusion cannon, even if the vehicle mode is a TAD less
impressive. Unless you're a completist, there's no reason to go for this
rather flawed Voyager class toy.

      Back on Cybertron, when it is late at
night, and very dark, robots tell each other stories of the war. They spin
stories about the deeds of Megatron, and though robots don't feel cold,
the listeners shiver. The only ones who don't enjoy a scary Megatron story
are the old ones, the ones who were there. Those old Autobots remember
the real Megatron. Many of them bear scars sustained in the heat of his
fusion cannon, or dents delivered by his powerful swords. To those old
robots, Megatron is no monster; he is a warrior so vicious and terrible
that monsters pale in comparison.
