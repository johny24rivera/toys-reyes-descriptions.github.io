    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Duststorm. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Duststorm

     Wideload is a good repaint
of Duststorm-- in fact, this is the color scheme the toy should probably
have had the first time around. Wideload's overall color scheme-- green,
black, and off-white-- is fairly original, and is more fitting for a construction
vehicle than Duststorm's dark blue. Plus, Wideload has several more colors
on him than his mold-brother, and more paint apps, to boot. I really like
how detailed his waist is in robot mode, and the few extra details added
to the base of the crane arm help to break up all the green. The gold-on-black
scheme used for Wideload's face also looks significantly better than Duststorm's
red-on-light-blue. The transparent blue plastic used for the Energon weapon
goes fairly well with Wideload's other color as well, though admittedly
not as well as with Duststorm, since the latter's color scheme was almost
exclusively blue anyways. In fact, my only real complaint when it comes
to Wideload's colors are that the yellow windows are a bit out-of-place
and overly "kiddish"-- what's so hard about putting a realistic silvery-blue
paint app on the windows instead?

     No mold changes have
been made to Wideload-- however, he does have a new blue Powerlinx symbol
on the top of his rear drivers' cockpit, whereas many of the Duststorms
didn't have this symbol. Also, the joints on my Wideload are a lot tighter
(in a good way) than the joints on my Duststorm, though this could just
be my toys.

     Wideload is a very nice
repaint, with an original color scheme and more paint apps than his predecessor.
Even though he's still definitely not the greatest Energon gestalt limb
out there, he's certainly a step above Duststorm.
