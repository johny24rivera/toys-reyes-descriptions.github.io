    "Steeljaw" is the name
given to the toy of one of several of the techno-organic alien hounds Lockdown
had at his disposal in the movie. The proportions in his beast mode are
excellent, and quite spot-on to the movie-- the head could be just a touch
smaller in comparison to the main body, I suppose, but that's really splitting
hairs at best. The mold detailing is stupendous, with a mix of molded-in
fur and occasional mechanical details everywhere-- I love how well the
weird wire-like details on the upper back are replicated so well on this
toy. Unfortunately, the color scheme is very two-tone-- nearly all of Steeljaw
is a moderately dark, dull navy blue plastic, with most of his paint apps
being bluish black "spray" apps on his back and the back ends of his upper
legs. I'm not sure why blue was chosen, given that the blue parts are a
rather fleshy color in the movie-- perhaps to tie the toy in with the then-soon-to-be-released
RID2015 Steeljaw character? Either way, it makes for a dull color scheme--
there's not nearly enough contrast between the blue and the black, and
the only other colors are the silver paint on Steeljaw's teeth and the
lime green detailing for his eyes. (The headsculpt is VERY well-done and
fearsome-looking, by the way.) I really wish Hasbro had spiced this up
a bit, and added some more paint apps to bring out all that lovely technorganic
detailing. As far as articulation-- Steeljaw has very little, despite looking
like he should have quite a bit. You can rotate his right front leg at
the shoulder, and his front paws can rotate like wrists, but that's it.
His other legs, his jaw-- none of them have any articulation except for
the left shoulder, but if you start to rotate that, his transformation
triggers, which is quite annoying. Why tie the transformation to such a
vital point of movement? This should have been a "fold the head down" or
"button press" transformation. Even given the limitations of one-steps,
there's no engineering reason elbow articulation on the front legs couldn't
have been added, as well as jaw movement and movement at the back ankles.

    As just mentioned, rotating
his left shoulder triggers his transformation, which is literally a "stand
me up and flip my head" transformation. As such, the two modes look very,
very similar, with about 80-90% of the parts being plainly visible and
part of both modes. With the wrists turned sideways, Steeljaw now has passable
hands, and extending bars lengthen the rear legs to make then slightly
more believable as human-proportioned legs, though having both the heels
AND the toes of the back feet of the beast mode form the robot feet looks
a little odd. It should be noted that this mode is completely made-up just
for this toy, and was never hinted at in the movie. The beast head makes
for a decent chest, though the robot head sculpt is not my favorite-- the
fur around the canine head is a bit too large proportionally, and the whole
thing just looks too much like a weird canine face without a snout. I realize
he's animalistic, but a BIT less beastly of a face would've looked better,
methinks, especially given the usual movieverse eyes with multiple "eyelashes"
thing he's got going on. The detailing on the sides of the chest-- the
underside of the beast mode-- is decent enough, but rather simplistic when
compared to his stellar technorganic detailing. The articulation in this
mode is identical to that of the beast mode, sadly.

    AoE Steeljaw doesn't
look BAD in either mode, but his modes look far too same-ish, and his color
scheme is not only dull with few noteworthy paint apps, but isn't movie-accurate,
either. Still, even considering this he would be a recommended purchase
if he had a decent range of articulation in either mode beyond just one
shoulder and wrist rotation; his mold detailing is fantastic, and his proportions
are great. But having him be so unnecessarily stiff-- in addition to the
negatives described earlier-- makes this a purchase I'd only recommend
for those who are really fans of the Steeljaw design and just want a toy
of him above all else. As a toy himself, he's not fun to play with, and
he really didn't have to be this way.
