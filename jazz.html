    Vehicle mode is a sportscar.
Just like the other early G1 Autobot "deluxe" cars, Jazz has an awesome
vehicle mode. He has clear windows (with no really obvious robot parts
inside, although a proper interior with seats is lacking), rubber tires,
and stickers out the wazoo. And I have to say, these stickers really liven
up what would otherwise be a rather mundane color scheme. And, unfortunately,
like the other G1 Autobot cars, his weapons are unstorable in vehicle mode,
which means you can lose them relatively easily, not to mention the pain
of having to find a seperate container for them.

    Jazz's robot mode is
a bit... odd. He has teeny arms compared to his big chest and body, and
feet that don't really look like feet. They're just... car halves held
together by metal poles with flat pieces of chrome that are supposed to
be the toes, or something. Even though they don't look a thing like 'em.
Jazz's head is also very small when compared with his huge chest, although
at least the head itself looks nice. It certainly adds a bit of character
to the toy, with the "sunglass-visor". As is typical for the old G1 toys
of this size, Jazz has exceptional articulation in the arms- his shoulders
can move at two points, his elbows at one point and his hands at one point-
but the rest of his body can't move at all. Jazz's weapons include a standard-issue
hand-held rifle and a rather clumsy shoulder-mounted one. The reason I
say "clumsy" is because the missile sticks out too far, being modified
as it is, and it doesn't stay clipped onto his head very well...

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Jazz is about middle-of-the-road
for a G1 Autobot car. Nothing extraordinarily bad or good about him, beyond
the articulation and proportion problems in robot mode, but that's normal
for G1. The $30 price tag is inane for such a small toy, though, so I'd
only recommend picking up this toy if you really like Jazz or, of course,
are a completist. Like me.

      Jazz loves Earth culture. Always looking
to learn more. His knowledge of Earth makes him the indispensable right-hand
man to Optimus Prime. Takes most dangerous missions. Very cool, very stylish,
very competent. Equipped with photon rifle, flamethrower, full-spectrum
beacon, 180db stereo speakers. Creates dazzling, disorienting sound and
light shows. Versatile, clever, daring, but prone to be distracted.
