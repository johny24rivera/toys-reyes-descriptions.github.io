    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations voyager Autobot
Springer. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations

     Battletrap was almost
an immediate popular request from Transfans after the Generations Springer
mold was revealed, and FunPub's finally delivered here. Instead of being
a "DuoCon" with the alt modes of a truck and a copter, he's now a triple
changer with the alt modes of a car and a copter-- close enough, honestly,
and I like triple changers more than DuoCons, so I love this idea. Battletrap's
colors, as you would expect, mostly are accurate to his G1 form, with dark
blue and black both being major colors. To get in some contrast, he's also
got a fair bit of light purplish gray-- a bit darker than the off-white
on the original G1 toy. However, I think this color change is for the better,
as not only does it provide the aforementioned contrast, but the slight
purplish tint helps it complement the purple and dark blue on Battletrap.
Because of the mold breakup, Battletrap's placement of his colors doesn't
quite match up with his G1 form, but both the gray and dark blue are varied
up enough throughout the figure that no one large area is solely one color.
For accent colors, there's a bit of dark purple on the feet and abs, which
serves as a nice complementary color to the blue, and pink, which gives
Battletrap a bit of lighter accent color in robot mode on the waist where
it's used. A reddish pinkish variant of the color is used for Battletrap's
transparent plastic, and it's a nice shade, giving Battletrap a titch of
the "later '80s" brightness in his color scheme while not being obnoxiously
bright compared to his otherwise mostly muted color scheme. Additionally,
there's a bit of silver here and there, like on his visor and wheel hubs.
Battletrap also has a couple of nice little paint details, like "DUO" bands
on the rear fins, which of course reference that he used to be a DuoCon.
He also has a black paint app only on the right side of his chest, which
mirrors his G1 rub symbol only being on that side of his G1 figure-- it's
a nice thought, but personally I would've preferred black apps on both
of his shoulders, as it looks too much like an error when the mold detailing's
already there.

     Battletrap has a new
headsculpt, which looks very much like a more detailed, better-proportioned
version of his G1 head. The details are all nice and crisp-- no complaints
here. Other than the headsculpt, though, no mold changes have been made
compared to Springer.

     BotCon 2015 Battletrap
was definitely an answer to many Transfans' wishes, though his value has
likely dropped after the character was released as a new-mold two-bot combiner
in "Power of the Primes". Still, it's an excellent mold, and a nice homage
with a great headsculpt-- but I do find the color scheme rather drab, with
the bits that lighten up the color scheme-- like the purple or pink paint
apps-- a bit too sparse. That's not FunPub's fault, as it's accurate to
the G1 toy, but I don't think this toy looks quite as good as Springer.

       Battletrap occasionally mulls the coincidence
that his split Duocon forms were once an early attempt in the Triple-Changer
process developed by Shockwave. And years later, that very process saved
him after being diagnosed with Machanimus Disjunctus. The two halves of
his brain located in his separate vehicle modes were developing an immunity
to each other, preventing them from fully merging when attempting to combine
into robot mode. Now with both parts of his brain reunited, Battletrap
is rediscovering the full depths of his processors. He is still a Decepticon
excited by the rough and tumble rather than intellectual pursuits, but
he now possesses creativity and cunning that he was unable to access in
his Duocon body.

       Perhaps still not comfortable in his
new brain, Battletrap finds himself content in the most mundane activities,
everything from hauling cargo for his team to standing guard for Megatron
or providing the muscle needed to subdue opposition. He is armed with a
double-barreled missile launcher for ranged attacks and a Night-Fire Blade
for melee attacks.
