    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Thunderhoof toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 3-step Thunderhoof

     Seismic Strike Thunderhoof
isn't a "barely-different" redeco, but he's not a complete and total overhaul,
either. The main difference is that this version has a lot more black on
it than the initial 3-step version, with black now used on the lower arms,
much of the chest, paint apps on the lower legs and hooves, and around
the wheel covers. Even much of the existing black paint on the original
3-step toy was a charcoal black, whereas this version has a more traditional
"purer" black on those same parts. In tractor mode, this black paint works
to the transformation's advantage, as the obvious extra tractor windows
down near the ground on the back end now aren't quite as obvious because
they're black and thus "blend in" a little more. Although it's not immediately
obvious, if you compare the two 3-step toys this version's main shade of
blue (on the horns, lower legs, etc.) is also a few noticeable shades darker.
There is still some of the fairly light blue paint on the middle of the
chest, the waist, and the kneecaps-- it really looks good against the black,
especially, and of course complements the darker blue pretty well. The
other major change is the addition of royal purple into Thunderhoof's color
scheme, which really looks nice against the black in particular but also
goes pretty decently with the blues, to boot. The purple is mostly used
for some decorative, angular paint apps that look like treads on the shoulders,
as well as more angular paint apps on the lower arms and chest. There's
also more "normal" royal purple paint apps on the side tractor windows
and on the lower legs, around the black paint apps-- it's a pretty nice
blend of colors down there on the lower legs. There's also a bit of royal
purple plastic, used mostly for joints and interior parts on the toy, and
are mostly visible on the exhaust pipe-like bits behind his shoulders in
robot mode. Of course, all these extra purple paint apps do come with a
few paint apps removed from the original's template; the silver on the
neck and abs is no more, and there's no paint on the side of the lower
arms, too. Still, overall it seems like this one is more heavily painted
than the original.

     Seismic Strike Thunderhoof
is a pretty good redeco, with some nice changes made to the original to
make his color scheme more visually interesting-- the addition of considerably
more black helps, but the added purple REALLY helps make Thunderhoof pop
more. Overall, if you don't care about show accuracy I'd definitely recommend
this redeco over the original version of this mold.
