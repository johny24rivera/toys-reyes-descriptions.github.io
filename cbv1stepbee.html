    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 1-step
2016 Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RID2015 1-step 2016 Bumblebee

     Like the other Wave 1
1-step Turbo Changers for Cyberverse, Bumblebee is just a redeco of the
RID2015 version of the character. Obviously being a redeco of a different
design, he's not going to match up 1-to-1 with the actual Cyberverse design,
especially in robot mode, but Hasbro has tried to "paint over" some of
the offending RID2015 details. The most noticeable differences in the paint
apps of this version compared to the RID2015 toys are the dual thin black
stripes he's got down both the hood of the vehicle mode, the faux hood-chest,
and on the robot forehead. The black paint is also down on the waist, and
his stomach is painted silver (along with this face), just like on the
Cyberverse design. There's also a fair amount of light blue coloring--
on the vehicle windows, part of the rear stripes, on the headlights, and
the robot eyes. Since it's a RID2015 toy it does have that circular bit
on the vehicle roof for the "scan symbol" for the RID2015 game, but for
Cyberverse they've obviously gotten rid of that, as it's just a plain Autobot
symbol (with a smaller, white-ridged Autobot symbol on the robot chest).
The black and yellow plastics are in the same places here as on the original
1-step changer, though the yellow plastic for this version of Bumblebee
is just a shade or two duller than on the RID2015 toys.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Bumblebee.

     The first go at Cyberverse
1-step changer Bumblebee doesn't really measure up design-wise as it's
inaccurate, being the RID2015 toy with different paint apps. However, that
important aspect aside, this is the best Cyberverse 1-step changer toy
of Bumblebee, having a fun transformation gimmick and a decent amount of
well-contrasting paint apps, particularly in robot mode (minus the barren
arms). Recommended if you're looking for a fun 1-step changer of 'Bee and
don't have any prior version of this mold.
