    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to SWTF Saesee Tiin. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of SWTF Saesee Tiin

     The Episode II Jedi Starfighter
gets repainted yet again, this time as the flagship character Kit Fisto!
Yes, that was sarcasm! Anyways, the color scheme is actually pretty decent
and unique. The white, maroon, and gray itself is a bit vanilla and kinda
typical for Star Wars Transformers, but the light green really helps make
the toy stand out from its other uses and blends well with the other colors,
as well. It's also done in really unique patterns, and the way the gred
paint apps blend with the gray works quite well, too.

     Like most SWTF redecos,
Kit Fisto has a new head. And like most SWTFs, I'm not too crazy about
a mechanized version of a head that is basically his "real" head with mechanical
lines running up and down it and pupil-less eyes. It's fairly accurate
to the character, I just don't like the overall look of it.

     SWTF Kit Fisto is one
of the better redecos of the mold, and the green really helps it stand
out for this over-used mold. I'd recommend some others-- such as Plo Kloon--
more, but if you like the character it's not a bad color scheme and vehicle
mode.

       Kit Fisto seeks out a planet overrun
by the droid army to test a powerful new weapon. The Nautolan warrior lands
his Jedi starfighter near a battalion of battle droids that immediately
attacks the lone Jedi. This is when Fisto unleashes his secret weapon:
he quickly converts his starfighter into a massive mech that crushes the
entire droid battalion!
