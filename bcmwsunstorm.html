not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For

     Man, the redeco that
many fans (myself included) badly wanted the Classics Starscream mold painted
into ever since 2006 finally happened-- 7 years later! Sunstorm is definitely
the most "well-known" among this troop builder Seeker trio, and the ones
fans tended to be the most vocal about that we never got at mass retail
(or at least as a mass-retail exclusive). I still can't believe Hasbro
never released this guy. Sunstorm's main color is a rather sunny shade
of orangish yellow. As you know if you've been reading my reviews for a
while, I'm not a big fan of yellow, but obviously it fits quite well on
Sunstorm, and I like the orangey touch that makes him look more like sunlight
than a straight yellow or orange would have. Like the others in this 3-pack,
though, all of the rest of his paint apps and plastic colors are identical
with the other Seekers in this pack. For example, he's got white on the
upper legs, the middle of the missile launchers and the triggers, and on
a few minor connector pieces, as well as the usual dark red-and-white Seeker
stripes along his main wings, tailfins, and robot shoulders. He also has
a transparent yellow cockpit window that fits in with the other Classics
Seekers, some silver on the intakes, the knees, the inside of the toes
and face, and the landing gear. For black, he's got some on the nosecone,
head, lower arms, feet and part of the lower legs, rear thrusters, and
a few other minor paint apps here and there. The amount of black is what's
really inaccurate on Sunstorm-- granted, I understand FunPub wanting to
keep costs on a troop builder set down a bit and thus only changing the
main color for each of the Seekers in the pack, but black has traditionally
been pretty minimal on Sunstorm-- with the exception of his head, some
of his minor wing paint apps, and perhaps on part of his missile launchers,
all of his black parts should be white, especially his robot mode bits
like his lower arms. Some white on his abdomen also would've been appreciated,
though again, I understand why it wasn't done. It's certainly obviously
Sunstorm despite these couple of inaccuracies, it's just more obvious on
Sunstorm than the other 'Cons in this set because he's had toys before.
There's one last color-- just a bit of dark red on the eyes and the intakes.

     It's a relief to see
the Classics Starscream FINALLY redecoed into Sunstorm to round out any
of the relatively "known" Seekers. The choice of sunny yellowish-orange
picked for his main plastic color is just perfect, but because of the shared
paint apps and much of the minor colors between him and the other two Seekers
in the set, he ends up being the most obviously inaccurate, with more black
in robot mode than he traditionally has had. I also would've loved some
"flame" paint apps on his wings to help distinguish him a bit more, but
I understand many fans wanted a more specifically G1-accurate paint scheme.
Still, though, it's good, but Sunstorm's my least favorite out of the troop
builder set.

       Deep inside Sunstorm's armor plating,
a built-in fusion reactor burns at a temperature far beyond original specifications.
Although he can focus this energy into a weapon that produces intense heat
and electro-magnetic pulses, the emissions from the reactor constantly
radiate from its casing and leak out from Sunstorm's body. Without secure
shielding, these emissions can interfere with teammates' internal systems.

       Sunstorm's ability to cause pain and

delve into delusions of grandeur where he believes himself to be of the
supernatural.
