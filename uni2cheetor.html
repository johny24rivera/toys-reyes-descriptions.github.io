    Cheetor's "new" cheetah
mode now looks a lot LOT more like a cheetah than his original version.
Granted, it still has the limitations of being a plastic toy, so it can't
look COMPLETELY convicingly like a cheetah, but still. The fur detailing
is all over the place, and the proportions are almost spot-on cheetah--
a very skinny, almost non-existant stomach, long legs, a bit of a hunch
back-- aww yeah. However, there are a few minor robot extras visible in
this mode-- from certain angles, you can see the robot fists inside the
front cheetah legs, and the top of the robot legs is a tad visible from
a side view, near the rear of the cheetah. Those aside, though, this mode
is very close to perfect. Cheetor's color scheme is spot-on to his classic
Beast Wars toy-- really the shades of pale metallic blue and dull yellow
are pretty much exact if you compare. Pretty much all of his paint apps
in beast mode are his spots, though he does have some neat "tan-white fur"
paint apps near his paws, which is of course realistic. I wish his tail
had spots as well, though. Cheetor can move at the top, middle, and at
the feet on each foot, and his tail can move where it connects to the main
body. Pressing down on a tab on Cheetor's back makes his eyes change from
green to light red (both eye colors on variants of the original Cheetor
toy) and his mouth opens up to "growl". Pretty cool!

    Cheetor's robot mode,
though... ick. Quite honestly, it's hard to believe Hasbro gave a deluxe
this misproportioned of a character at deluxe size in this day-and-age.
His proportions are absolutely awful-- he has this HUUUGE hunch behind
his main body, for one-- basically half of his cheetah mode sticks out
from behind his back, without collapsing at all. That's WAY too much of
a price to pay for a simple eye-color-changing gimmick. His arms are also
way too short, and the lower parts are bolted into the shells of the upper
front legs, which makes articulation extremely restricted, even though
they would have much more freedom of movement otherwise. The feet are also
so long they're clown-like, as they're made of almost half of the rear
cheetah legs flattened out. His lower front cheetah legs also stick out
rather blantantly from the sides of the lower arms. In addition, his lower
body hooks in at a slight angle compared to his upper body, which is a
little odd, and his head sculpt is... off. His "cat lips" are too big,
and he doesn't look youthful enough. He also comes with a really lame "tail
whip" weapon, which have been done to death and beyond by now-- and it
doesn't move at any point either, so it's more of a beat stick. He also
really needs more paint apps on his robot mode, particularly on his leg--
he needs more blue. However, two "ninja stars" can be taken out from the
little "pockets" on the sides of his lower legs and unfolded, which are
pretty cool new weapons for the character. In addition, I do appreciate
the detailing that's almost exactly the same as the original Cheetor toy,
such as the waist detailing and the knee detailing. I also like how he
has an actual stomach this time, and his entire main body isn't just composed
of a cheetah head.

    Universe Cheetor has
an excellent, excellent vehicle mode, but unfortunately that's all but
ruined by his horribly proportioned robot mode which makes his original
robot mode from over 15 years ago look tons better in comparison. Out of
all the Universe deluxes, I'd sadly have to recommend this one the least.

      Cheetor has always been fast. Other
robots move at speeds that seem agonizingly slow to him, as if they were
trapped in tar. Unfortunately, a lot of the time he moves a lot faster
than he thinks, and finds himself in situations that, in retrospect, could
have been avoided. Still, his speed has gotten him out of a lot more jams
than it's gotten him into, and when speed isn't enough he can always break
out his blades.
