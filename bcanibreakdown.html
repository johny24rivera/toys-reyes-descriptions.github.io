    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated Rodimus Minor.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated Rodimus Minor

     Breakdown-- like the
other 'Cons in the "Stunti-Con Job" box set-- is an homage to the G1 Stunticon
character of the same name. His color scheme is pretty much spot-on with
his G1 namesake, or at least as close as one can reasonably get with this
mold. The white is a slightly dirty, off-white color, which isn't too great
in and of itself, but the dark periwinkle-blue that's used for most of
the parts on the lower half of the vehicle mode goes wonderfully with it.
Black and the same fuchsia that's on most of the other Stunticons help
to round out his color scheme-- the fuchsia in particular goes with the
other two colors pretty well. His headlights and taillights are also a
light red color, which honestly looks a tad TOO light given that Breakdown's
main color in vehicle mode is off-white. I do appreciate that his transparent
plastic is darkly tinted, however, to prevent you from seeing his head
in vehicle mode. There are some pretty nicely-done paint apps on this toy,
such as the way there's a line that cuts across the middle of his vehicle
mode and to make his top half off-white and his bottom half dark blue,
or the way the center of his hood has fuchsia on it just like the G1 toy.
That said, the mold itself looks far too "Rodimus-y"-- particularly in
vehicle mode-- to come across easily as someone else.

     Breakdown has a new
head mold, but like his overall sculpt, it's obvious it was meant to be
another character (Sideswipe) first. The head itself bears little-- if
any-- resemblance to G1 Breakdown's. Granted, that doesn't make it look
bad-- it's a pretty decent-looking headsculpt-- but it doesn't call to
mind any of Breakdown's characteristics that makes him Breakdown, so I'm
not that crazy about it.

     Breakdown has a pretty
decent color scheme, but unfortunately out of all the toys in this set
he's the one that fits his mold the worst. His overall mold looks far too
much like Rodimus in vehicle mode to see it as anyone else, and in robot
mode his new headsculpt is too obviously Sideswipe. Still an excellent
toy, but the weakest link of the Botcon 2011 boxset when it comes to homages.

       Profoundly unlucky and saddled with
an inferiority complex, Breakdown's all-consuming paranoia runs so rampant
that it often distracts him and causes accidentes, becoming a self-fulfilling
prophecy. He takes out his frustrations on others to cover for his own
insecurities. His bow fires sonic disruptor arrows that scramble mechanical
circuits.
