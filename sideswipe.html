    Mold History

   : Side Swipe's mold
was originally planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers:
Generation 2, but it never went through. Now his mold finally sees release
for RiD!

    Side Swipe's vehicle
mode is a sportscar. This mode looks very nice! The green and black go
together very well, and the silver windows and "engine" showing complement
them very nicely. There are no extras whatsoever in this mode, which is
nice. The robot mode gun is nicely stored in the rear in this mode, like
the other Wave 2 Spychangers. It's nice to actually be able to STORE the
gun in this mode, unlike with the Wave 1 Spychangers... My only complaint
about this mode (and a minor one at that) is that Side Swipe's rear of
his car mode has several smaller details that aren't painted accordingly
(since when are barred headlights green, for instance?).

    I don't really like
Side Swipe's robot mode, but then, I don't like any of the Wave 1 and 2
Spychangers' robot modes anyway. His transformation is slightly screwed
up- you have to push down the hood halfway, THEN pull out the robot arms
before you finish pushing it down all the way. Side Swipe's robot mode
has a head that is too small proportionally, and his chest is huge in this
mode, and sticks out quite a bit. The curves on the top of the car-chest
only hide his face when viewed from a diagonal angle at eye-level. His
chest also doesn't swing down all the way in this mode, something stops
it about three-fourths of the way down. You actually have to file away
the copyright information imprinted on the plastic on the underside of
the car before it will fold down all the way. Side Swipe's only movable
parts in this mode are his arms, at the shoulders. That's it (not to mention
his arms are just molded onto the inside of his car doors, which just looks
bad). This extremely limits playability, as one might expect- his legs
are both just molded together into one piece! Bah. Side Swipe's "cheese"
yellow looks rather clashing in this mode as well- replacing it with more
dark blue or black plastic would have been a better idea. At least Side
Swipe's head has character, though- his eyes are huge silver goggles! A
pretty neat characterization, makes him look like an inventor or something.

    Like most other Spychangers,
Side Swipe has a pretty crummy robot mode, but a good vehicle mode. A few
bonus points thrown in for being able to store the gun in vehicle mode,
too, but it's still nothing to write home about.
