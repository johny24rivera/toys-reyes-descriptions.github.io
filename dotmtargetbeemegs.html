       This is one of the many
store-exclusive redecos of Bumblebee that's sadly completely unneeded.
This mold has already been repainted and recolored to death, and the color
scheme here is barely any different than on most Bumblebees. The windows
are bit more of a silvery tint than on most Bumblebee toys, and there's
two stripes down his entire top like he has in Dark of the Moon. He also
has black "flame" paint apps behind each of his front wheels, but that's
about the only unique thing for this Bumblebee redeco.

       There's been no mold
changes to this version of Bumblebee, except for the slight remolding of
one of his fists to hold Cyberverse weapons, as well as a two-part double-barreled
rifle accessory that, sadly, doesn't store in his vehicle mode.

           Megatron, on the other
hand, not only has a completely different color scheme than the mass release
versions of him, but it's also an homage to another Decepticon truck commander--
namely, Motormaster. The primarily black and silver color scheme is pretty
basic, but it gets the job done pretty effectively and the two colors contrast
well with each other. In robot mode, he's got a dark gray plastic that
takes the place of much of the silver, but it's got a bit of a metallic
swirl that makes it actually look rather nice (albeit not as great as the
painted silver, of course). In terms of accent colors, there's a bit of
light purple, which works VERY well with the black-- but it's barely used
at all, and it really would've made the toy look even better if used in
a couple more places. Like most of the other Target exclusive releases
for Dark of the Moon, Megatron also has a few silver and off-white "Cyberglyph
tattoos" on him, which help to add a little more visual variety. (Using
an off-white color for the Cyberglyphs on the silver paint was a nice idea,
so that his tank could have those tattoo paint apps as well.)

             This Target exclusive
2-pack has an excellent redeco of Megatron that looks really good even
if you ignore the homage to Motormaster. Unfortunately, he comes with a
barely-repainted Bumblebee which are a dime a dozen among store exclusive
sets. HOWEVER, the price for this 2-pack is just about a dollar above getting
Megatron by himself, so you're paying almost nothing for the Bumblebee--
I consider 'Bee to be just a little bonus. Mildly recommended if you don't
have a version of this Megatron mold or just like his DotM design (it's
not going to look any better than this).

mute back on Cybertron, and ever since, the Decepticon leader has looked
forward to finishing the job. The Autobot scout has been a thorn in the
side of the Decepticon army for ages. It is time to do away with Bumblebee,
once and for all.
