    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Leobreaker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron

     Unlike the other Legends
Classics repaints, Leo Prime isn't an homage to a G1 character-- instead,
he's an homage to a Japanese Beast Wars II character named Lioconvoy, who
was the "Prime" of that series and also was a white lion with a gold mane.
And it's a great color scheme to copy-- the white and gold contrast magnificently
against each other, and the red goes nicely against the white as well.
Plus, together they give off a very "Autobot leader" vibe. What's also
cool is that over half of the different colors on the figure are only used
in one place-- it gives the impression that more care went into the color
scheme, and gives Leo Prime more color variety. Plus, he has the typical
"blue head and silver face" that all Primes have. The only real change
I would have made to the paint applications (which he's got plenty of,
by the way) is I would have colored the underside of the robot mode "ponytail"
gold as well, since it's kind of weird-looking having the top part of the
ponytail painted gold while the bottom half is white.

     Leo Prime is an excellent
repaint of a good, if rather simplistic, Legend-class mold. All of the
colors go really well together and fit a Prime very nicely-- this mold's
not going to get any better than this, folks.
