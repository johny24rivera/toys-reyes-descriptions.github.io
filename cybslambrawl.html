    In his Cyber Slammer
form, Brawl is probably the most deformed out of all of the toys in the
Cyber Slammer subline, and that's saying quite a bit. The main body of
the tank is way, way, WAY oversized compared to the two turrets on top,
and especially compared to the comparatively miniscule silver edges on
the front of his tank mode. I think Hasbro went a bit overboard in the
chibi-fying of Brawl, even considering that this is aimed at the little
bitty kids. Neither of the turrets can rotate, either, though considering
the transformation of the Cyber Slammers this is admittedly impossible.
The mold detailing is decent, bringing out the appropriate details when
necessary, but not getting too complicated so as not to spoil the whole
"simple kiddy toy" look of the subline. The paint camo job looks great,
but sadly that and the black treads are pretty much all the paint detailing
you'll find in this mode (except for a few silver paint apps on the front),
and Brawl could REALLY use some more paint apps, especially on his turret.

    Like all Cyber Slammers,
Brawl can be locked in tank mode by pushing the white tab on the bottom
of the toy forward-- otherwise, when you slam down Brawl's robot body into
his vehicle mode, the tank will take off (providing he's on a flat surface),
and after scooting about six feet or so the robot mode body will pop back
up again. Because of this gimmick, Brawl doesn't really have any lower
body in robot mode, just most of his tank mode. His main body, head, and
arms are molded onto the underside of most of the top part of his tank
mode. The robot mode parts look REALLY well-done, though, to the point
where I think Brawl's robot mode looks the best out of all the Cyber Slammers
in terms of its detailing. The metallic silver and gold paint apps go together
really, REALLY nicely, especially on the head (heck, I wish the MAINLINE
toys of Brawl had shades of silver and gold that looked this good), and
the mold detailing is sculpted extraordinarily well, striking a nice balance
between "fearsome" and "kiddy". Strangely enough, the red "cutesy" eye
dots work well on Brawl, probably because he has more than two optics to
begin with so it's not too much of a stretch, not to mention his eyes are
still narrowed like a bad guys' should be. Like the other Cyber Slammers,
Brawl's articulation is pretty restricted due to his gimmick-- his head
can move from side to side and his arms can move back-and-forth at the
shoulders, though the shoulders snap back into their default position once
you let go of them. Also, Brawl doesn't quite snap up all the way, due
to a bit too much plastic bulk on his back end, so he leans forward just
a tad, which I find an odd design decision.

    Cyber Slammer Brawl's
tank mode is so deformed it looks ridiculous-- even keeping in mind the
kiddy nature of the subline-- but his robot mode parts are really well-sculpted
and well-painted, especially for a Cyber Slammer, and they blend just the
right amount of "kiddy" with "evil". If a youngin' you know is clamoring
for some bad guys from that movie with the fighting robots, I'd definitely
recommend this toy, but for older kids or us grown-ups I'd stick to the
mainline versions of Brawl unless you're a completist.
