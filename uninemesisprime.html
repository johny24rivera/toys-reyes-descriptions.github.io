    (Like all Universe toys, this is a redeco
of an earlier TF-- Beast Wars Neo Big Convoy, to be exact, previously only
available via the Japanese market. Since I don't have the original mold,
I'll be reviewing this toy completely.)

     The evil Optimus clone,
Nemesis Prime, is back for another round, this time in Universe as a wooly
mammoth! (Or mastodon... I forget the difference...) I rather like the
attempt to make a mold that was supposed to have been reserved for a good
guy instead made to look evil; the black-and-silver fur, the red eyes,
and the blood-stained tusks are really, really nice touches. Only a few
robot extras-- a few parts of the robot legs here and there-- poke out
underneath the mammoth hair. However, look at the mode for a few seconds
and you'll see the problem-- there's tons of little cracks running in between
the various plastic parts that make up the mammoth's body, and almost effectively
ruin the look entirely by themselves. There's just too many little cracks
in the plastic to give the mode a realistic feel. Also, Nemesis Prime can't
move in this mode. At all. Pretty much all you can do with this mode are
play with his gimmicks-- push down on his ears to bring the tusks up for
some goring action, and press back on the tab on his head to make his trunk
curve up. They're fair gimmicks, but they only make the mode marginally
less boring.

     Probably the biggest
single drawback Nemesis Prime has, though, is his transformation. Getting
him into robot mode isn't too bad, but getting him back into beast mode...
well, "a pain in the butt" isn't a strong enough phrase, really. It's INCREDIBLY
annoying-- all the pieces have to line up just right, and the instructions
don't help very much. It took me nearly an HOUR the first time I tried
to transform him into beast mode. Once you figure out exactly where each
piece is supposed to go and in what position, it becomes a little easier,
but it still takes a while. The transformation should be fun, not a chore.
And unfortunately, Nemesis Prime's is the latter.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nemesis Prime's robot
mode is much cooler than his alternate mode, and with much better articulation--
he can move at pretty much any point you can reasonably expect on a Transformer
of this size, and most of those joints are ball joints, allowing for even
greater motion. The proportions can't be beat-- Nemesis Prime has a powerful
look to him that is both organic and mechanical at the same time. I especially
like the asymmetrical detailing applied to his arms-- one looks "normal",
while the other is partially transparent with many wires and panels running
through it, almost like it was severely damaged and then repaired haphazardly.
It looks really cool. Taking his cues from his
     <a href="nemesisprime.html">
      Armada
namesake
     </a>
     , Nemesis Prime has a black and brown color scheme, with some
red, teal, and silver highlights. I think the overall scheme goes excellently
together and looks great-- it positively drips evil. I would've perhaps
preferred a bit more black on the robot parts, but that's a small nitpick.
One of Nemesis Prime's coolest details is that, if you open his chest up,
he has a "Dead Matrix" inside, as the packaging calls it. It looks great,
it's removable from the cavity (see the above pic), and it further cements
Nemesis Prime as THE Decepticon version of Optimus. And no one can ever
say that Nemesis Prime doesn't have his fair share of weapons-- he has
two small, nonfiring weapons under his arms, two large firing grappling
hooks attached to his lower legs, and a HUGE double-barrelled gun. In fact,
that's what I don't like about it-- the gun is so big, that Nemesis Prime's
arm droops under its weight. Most of its mass is actually made up of mammoth
parts, too, to the point where it almost looks goofy in its proportions.
As for firing the missiles, instead of pressing individual triggers, you
turn a circular knob on the gun which fires one missile after the other.
It's rather cool, as it means that you won't have any touchy triggers going
off when you don't want them to. My most significant complaint about Prime's
robot mode is all the mammoth parts hanging off him-- Nemesis is a shellformer,
and it shows. I think the halves of his mammoth head, positioned on his
shoulders like they are, actually complement the mode, but all the rest
of the parts-- the panels hanging off his gun, his hips, and his legs--
not only look odd, but interfere with Prime's range of articulation a great
deal. Needless to say, I don't particularly miss the days of the Japanese
shellformers.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nemesis Prime is a welcome
addition to the Universe line, as it marks the first modern mold that was
previously only available in Japan being used in this line. However, it's
a shellformer, like many other Beast Wars Neo toys, and as such, it has
tons of kibble in robot mode, no articulation in beast mode, and an incredibly
frustrating transformation. He does have some mighty cool features, but
be warned-- his flaws are not insignificant.

       The most vile creation of the evil Unicron
is a creature so shameful and foul that Autobot warriors fear to speak
of it. Nemesis Prime - the powerful but twisted clone of the legendary
Optimus Prime, pulled out of time and perverted to the cruel villain's
purposes - possesses all the knowledge and wisdom of the Autobot leader,
but is powered by a deep love of evil and destruction. Perhaps the greatest
threat to the Universe ever created by Unicron, Nemesis Prime carries within
its body the Dead Matrix, an artifact capable of negating and destroying
forever the powerful Autobot Matrix of Leadership.
