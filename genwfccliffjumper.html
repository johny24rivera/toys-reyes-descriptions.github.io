    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Cybertronian
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations
Cybertronian Bumblebee

     The relative number of
times Bumblebee has been repainted into Cliffjumper has lessened over the
years, but it's still done-- as is the case with this toy, of course. The
colors are quite true to Cliffjumper, with red and black being the main
colors. The red is a bit darker, more metallic of a shade than is usually
used on Cliffjumper toys, and looks quite nice. The black used in vehicle
mode breaks it up quite nicely (and the tinted clear plastic used for the
windows is so dark it might as well be black in that mode). In robot mode
most of the "black" is in fact a very dark bluish gray that contrasts almost
as well, but keeps Cliffjumper from being a bit two-tone. As far as accent
colors go, the silver used on parts of the robot mode looks alright, but
the yellow highlights-- such as the lines down the sides of the vehicle
mode, the taillights, and the spots on his stomach-- really pop against
the red, and make the toy considerably more eye-catching all by themselves.
The transparent yellowish orange plastic used for his wrist-blades, wheels,
and headlights is also a nice shade, but unless you have a strong light
shining behind the figure it doesn't contrast quite enough to stand out
against the red.

     The head mold for Cliffjumper
has been changed-- no Bumblebee head on this guy! It's a very G1-looking
head, however, which can cause some minor problems for those picking up.
Oh, he fits his appearance in the Nintendo DS version of
     <a href="wfcds.html">
      War
for Cybertron
     </a>
     just fine, but when he was later used in the (more popular)
360/PS3
     <a href="focps3.html">
      Fall of Cybertron
     </a>
     game, his head was
changed to look more like it does in the Prime series. Given that that's
probably what most will remember him in the games as, it can be a bit disconcerting
here, with the body looking completely "accurate" except for the head.
That was a change that came well after this toy hit the shelves, though,
so I won't hold it against this figure.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Generations "War for
Cybertron" Cliffjumper is a pretty nice (if predictable) repaint of a decent
mold. If you like futuristic vehicle modes, Cliffjumper, and/or the War
for Cybetron/Fall of Cybertron games, then this release is for you.

       Even before the war, Cliffjumper was
constantly spoiling for a fight. The Decepticons just gave him an excuse.
He's been bending fenders and smashing heads for years now, and the fun
never stops. Despite his short temper, he gets along well with the other
Autobots, who appreciate his eagerness to take the first shot in every
battle.
