    As with pretty much every
other PotP Prime Master, Solus Prime bears basically no resemblance to
her previous designs (none of which made it to toy form, unfortunately).
In robot mode, she looks mostly like any other Prime Master, at least sculpt-wise.
She's got pretty generic detailng on her legs, with some "skinnier legs"
detailed on the blocks that form her lower feet, and some hands molded
into the end of her arm pieces, which have some small indentations around
the shoulders as well. The chest has a couple of small square button-like
details on it, but otherwise nothing noteworthy. Her headsculpt is pretty
square, with two small side antennae, a visor, and a faceplate-- definitely
VERY different from how Solus has traditionally been depicted. In this
mode, her arms, upper legs, head, and the piece behind her body are fuchsia,
while her lower legs and chest are seafoam green. It's pretty basic, but
it's a pretty solid color scheme, and definitely connects her thematically
with her Pretender shell. There's a bit of yellow paint on the optic and
mouthplate, but that's it as far as deco in this mode. Like with essentially
every Prime Master, in this mode Solus Prime can move at the neck, as well
as back-and-forth at the shoulders, hips, and knees (the latter two as
one for both legs, since the legs are molded together). In core mode, the
core symbol is a pale blue-painted circle with an outline around it and
a short line pointed downwards. Is it meant to be someone pouring molten
metal into a mold (from a top-down perspective), since she's a weapons
expert? That's about the only sense I can make of it. Anyways, the details
in the fuchsia plastic surrounding the core symbol are pretty cool, with
lots of round detailing that has a bit of a "royal" feeling to it, with
details kinda resembling a many-pronged (but circular) crown near the top,
as well as some linear details on the VERY edge of the square that look
a bit like hair... I think they took Solus Prime's basic head design for
this piece, took out her face, and added in her core symbol instead.

    The Pretender shell
for the set is based off of G1 Octopunch, which looked like a deep-sea
diver monster with octopus tentacles coming out of him. The main Pretender
shell sticks to the more human aspect of Octopunch, while the weapon instead
has the tentacles on it. On Octopunch's back the tentacles enhance his
silhouette well enough, but when put in one of his hands as a weapon? It
doesn't really look like a weapon, minus the barely-noticable blaster nozzle
coming out of the center front. It IS well-detailed, though, with little
suction cups on all four tentacles, and some more mechanical claw-like
detailing near the center. (The bottom of the weapon has some more simplistic
detailing, with some segmented lines on the tentacles and some basic rectangular
details in the center.) As for Octopunch himself, it fits the bill of a
smaller version of the G1 Pretender shell pretty well-- the head is just
a deep-sea diver's helmet with a mysterious painted-on visor to hide who's
really in there, while the body has some old-school mechanical oxygen hose
hookup details on them. The arms are pretty straightforward, being round
and robotic but otherwise not looking particularly unique. The legs get
more fantastical, with a skull on the "belt", ridged upper legs, armored
lower legs with pointy kneecaps, and two-toed sharp claw-like feet. From
the front the color scheme is quite well-done-- in addition to the aforementioned
seafoam green and fuchsia, there's also some off-white on the chest, gray
on the waist and knees, and some yellow on the helmet visor and on the
middle portion of the weapon. All in all, it's a great, varied color scheme,
and my favorite scheme overall out of the PotP Pretender shells. As with
the rest of the PotP Pretender shells, looking at him from the side he
looks too wide, and it's all just seafoam green back there-- no other colors.
It is covered with a good amount of mechanical mold detailing, though,
including some pipes and circular details on the upper back. The arms can
move forward-and-back and the shoulders in this mode-- like with the other
Pretenders, Octopunch doesn't have much articulation. Just like with the
other PotP Pretenders, Octopunch has a "weapon mode" where you just lay
the shell on its stomach, flip out the weapon from the back, and then flip
out a peg from between the feet so a larger Transformer can hold it. Most
of the weapon modes are pretty underwhelming, but this one especially so,
since that tentacle-thing doesn't really look like a weapon, and then of
course you've got basically the whole body and arms as blatant extras in
this mode. As with other weapon modes, you can attach Solus (or another
Titan Master) on the top center to become a sort of "power source" for
this mode if you want, but I generally just tend to ignore these awful
weapon modes.

    Although the Solus Prime/Octopunch
set definitely has its fair share of downsides-- an awful weapon mode,
very limited articulation, the Pretender looking too wide from the side--
all of these downsides are shared across every Prime Master set. The color
scheme itself of (mostly) seafoam green and fuchsia looks fantastic, and
Octopunch is a very unique Pretender and one of my favorites overall. Because
of this, this is my most-recommended out of all the Prime Master sets.
