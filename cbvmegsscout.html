    Megatron's "partial vehicle
mode" transformation for his scout-class toy is, like many, essentially
a vehicle mode bottom-half with a robot mode upper-half. The problem is,
even the half of the tank that's still present is rather weak; there's
an obvious gap in between the sides since each part obviously becomes one
of Megatron's legs, and the details on the sides of the vehicle mode have
rather hollow mold detailing on the back half-- the tread wheels are still
there, but there's some hollow gaps in the middle of those pieces, and
there's an obvious foot hanging off each back end piece as well. At least
the front of his tread pieces have some pretty decent wheel-and-tread detailing
on the sides. The upper portion is basically just Megatron as is traditionally
seen, with a rather square torso, shoulders, and arms. He does have the
details on the abs you'd expect, like some small vents on the sides and
some panel-like detailing over his stomach. You can see some VERY basic
tread-and-wheel detailing on his shoulders, but overall the detailing on
his upper body is pretty underwhelming, not having much beyond the few
basic "big blocks"-- even his fusion cannon is missing. His head sculpt
looks decent though, with a nice scowl on his big-chinned face. The proportions
are bit off on the upper body, as his arms are a bit too bulky, and his
head is too small in comparison to his chest. For Megatron's gimmick, if
you rotate his upper body right and back, it'll click into place. Then
squeeze his back tread-pieces together and his body will rotate forward
abruptly, with his right arm folding out a large panel on it that has his
"Energon mace" weapon molded onto the inside of it as a bit of a surprise
attack. It's kinda cool, though I wish the weapon was actually fully "fleshed
out" and not just molded onto the inside of a larger panel. For articulation
in this mode, Megatron can move up-and-down at the shoulders a bit, but
that's it.

    Most scouts don't have
much to their transformation, but Megatron REALLY doesn't have much-- just
fold his rear leg panels forward to connect with his front legs, then stand
him up and you're done. Again, this is mostly the same toy here, it's just
he's walking now instead of moving along on treads. The new legs suffer
a bit from the transformation, as the feet are too far out due to the transformation--
they look weird. Otherwise the legs are okay prportionally, with some basic
"missle pack" and tread details molded into the sides. The paint is more
visible in this mode, and it's needed, since Megatron's plastic is all
the same moderately light gray shade on this toy. There's some red lining
on his abs and waist, as well as on his eyes. Black is the most common
paint color, used on his waist, a little of his stomach, and on the missile
pack/tread
details on his legs (interesting, that his tread details are painted in
this mode but not his actual pseudo-tank mode). You've got some silver
on his face, and then of course some hot pink on the mace revealed when
his gimmick is deployed. Overall he's decently detailed on his lower body,
but his upper body really could use some more paint to break up all that
gray. Megatron's gimmick doesn't work in this mode, though given that the
mace-panel is only held in by gravity (and even barely then), you can flip
it out without the "sudden rotating of the body" gimmick if you still want
Megs to use it in this mode. I kinda wish it had a little hitch to keep
it in, honestly-- that panel's rather annoying, how easily it comes out.
For articulation in this mode, beyond the aforementioned arm movement,
Megs can move back and forth at the hips, as well.

    There's not much to
recommend regarding Cyberverse scout Megatron. His vehicle mode is really
lazy even by scout-class standards, his chest and arms are comically large
proportionally, the panel his mace is on flips out far too easily, and
he really could use some more paint apps in his pseudo-vehicle mode. I'd
recommend basically any Cybeverse Megatron toy over this one, honestly.
