    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 Slipstream
Weaponizer toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RID2015 Slipstream Weaponizer

     Slipstream in his "default
colors" was released in a Mini-Con 4-pack, so for this solo release he's
given a color scheme that kinda lines up with his earlier
     <a href="rid2blizslipstream.html">
      Blizzard
Strike version
     </a>
     . However, the colors aren't quite the same; for one,
the blue used is a fairly light, pale arctic blue, which is a decent color
by itself but a bit TOO pale as a main color. A good contrasting secondary
color on the main toy would have helped make this pop, but instead we get
a light milky gray plastic-- and on the same parts as on the original Weaponizer
Slipstream, as well (the legs and some minor connector parts). There's
a bit of paint, but it's all on Slipstream's face-- his center head crest
and face are painted silver, while his eyes are painted a light blue. Unfortunately,
this light blue is so similar in shade to his pale arctic blue it's a bit
difficult to tell the two colors apart-- something a bit more bold should
have been used, methinks. Thus, by himself, this version of Weaponizer
Slipstream looks a bit dull-- until, that is, you add the armor pieces.
They're a transparent fiery orange that's also a bit dark, and which contrasts
EXTREMELY well against the light pale arctic blue. It's really a snazzy
color; it's harder to think of a transparent plastic color that would've
worked better against the pale blue. So even though he's "Blizzard Strike",
this version of Slipstream is spittin' fire.

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Weaponizer Slipstream.

     The single-pack version
of Weaponizer Slipstream has a really nice shade of transparent plastic--
a nice, dark fiery orange-- but the core toy itself is rather dull. The
blah light milky gray plastic is still kept, it has fewer paint apps than
the 4-pack version, and the blue itself is a bit TOO pale/light to really
work. Making the blue bolder would've looked better. It's still a pretty
good Mini-Con mold, but unless you're a Mini-Con completist you may want
to stick to the 4-pack version of this mold (which is also generally easier
to find).
