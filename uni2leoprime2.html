    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Voyager Leobreaker.

     Now as a Target Exclusive,
Leo Prime has gotten released in the colors he should've been in for the
     <a href="uni2leoprime.html">
      first
Universe release
     </a>
     -- colors homaging Lioconvoy, the leader of the Maximals
from the Japanese series Beast Wars the 2nd (and also homaged in the Classics
     <a href="leoprime.html">
      Legends release
     </a>
     of the character). White is
now Leo Prime's primary color, with light brown, gray, and red being the
main accents. The gray admittedly doesn't add much, but the red and light
brown look REALLY nice against the white, even though in no way is this
color scheme realistic. But particularly in robot mode with the dark blue
head, it does give off a very "Prime-ish" vibe, despite the flip-flopped
amounts of the colors and the addition of brown. The silver used on the
ankles and robot waist is a particularly shiny, eye-catching color, and
Leo Prime has a few sparsely used accent colors-- like the dark blue and
yellow on his waist-- that really make it look like care was put into crafting
his overall color scheme. The sides of his legs in beast mode don't have
many paint apps on them, but otherwise Leo Prime has plenty of paint on
him, so he doesn't look particularly boring in any area.

     This version of Leo
Prime has the same head remold as the mass-release version of this toy
for Universe 2.0, and like that version, the electronics have also been
removed. He also has that inexplicable Autobot symbol mix-up on his chest
as the previous Leo Prime. &gt;:( Otherwise, no mold changes have been made
to this toy when compared to Cybertron Leobreaker.

     The Target Exclusive
release of Universe 2.0 Leo Prime has a great color scheme, even ignoring
the nice Lioconvoy homage. Just the right amounts of each color are used,
with some well-spaced-out paint apps. If you're going to get one version
of this (pretty mediocre) mold, make it this one.

       Leo Prime is a career soldier, commander
of an elite Maximal black ops unit designated the Pack. So secret is his
unit, even most of those in the Maximal command structure are aware of
it only as a rumor. Leo Prime and his comrades in the Pack travel wherever
trouble is thickest, often working undercover to deal crippling blows to
Predacon plots.
