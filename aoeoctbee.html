    What's old is new again,
amirite? To avoid the authorities, Bumblebee went and took on an old camaro
form-- y'know, just like in the
    <a href="movbumblebee70.html">
     first movie
    </a>
    .
But this time, his colors are switched like they usually are only on his
redecos, with black being the dominant color and orangish-yellow being
only a secondary color-- surely the authorities will
    <i>
     never
    </i>
    suspect
him now! Anyways, logic aside, this is a pretty darned awesome car mode.
Its proportions are perfect-- as you'd expect from a toy with a licensed
alt mode. There are some robot mode extras, but the only obvious ones are
the bits of his waist and legs visible inside the clear windows (really,
Hasbro, if you're going to make all the windows transparent, tint them
dark enough that we can't so easily see the robot internals!). There's
also just a touch of Bumblebee's heels visible from the back end, but this
is getting picky. I've always liked the "reverse Bumblebee" color scheme,
and this toy is no different; the yellow used sparsely looks better against
a darker color than visa versa. The rear spoiler is painted, as well as
a fairly nifty triple-stripe across his front above the grill (it should
be around the whole front grill to be movie-accurate though, not just the
top). His clear parts are painted partially black because of the mold breakup
as well, and the black paint matches the black plastic perfectly, fortunately.
(Also, clear rear windows for once! Yay!) That said, a few more orange-yellow
paint apps to break up the black a bit more wouldn't have hurt-- the headlights
and taillights are lacking paint, as well. The mold detailing is pretty
sparse on this mode, with the wheels being the only parts with relatively
intricate detailing, but it matches the source material, so I can't really
complain there.

    Hasbro's had plenty
of previous tries to get Bumblebee's transformation at the deluxe size
"right", and since this is Bumblebee before he gets his "upgrade" in the
movie, his transformation and general look in robot mode (color scheme
aside) is pretty familiar and sticks to a tried-and-true formula. The car
doors and front wheels hang off his back as "wings"; his roof is partially
collapsed behind his back; his chest is the car front broken up a bit;
and the leg transformation is pretty much exactly the same as it's always
been for his previous movie deluxe toys. There are a few slight differences,
though; for one, the panels on top of the chest flip up. I have mixed feelings
about this; on the one hand, it makes his chest look fragmented like in
the movie, but on the other hand, it leaves a bit of a gap in between his
head and the front of his chest, which is a little unsightly. His proportions
are largely good, though his arms could stand to be a little longer and
thicker (in fact, as a whole this toy is a tad smaller than previous movie
Bumblebee deluxes, showing how Hasbro is dealing with cost-cutting). The
roof sitting behind his back doesn't fold up as much as I'd like and sticks
out some, but it doesn't get in the way of articulation so I don't mind
it much. Same with the door/tire wings; I wish they connected to each other
instead of making it look like 'Bee has four wings, but they still stay
out of the way and keep Bumblebee's general silhouette the same. There
aren't any little annoying pieces of vehicle kibble on his knees this time
around, thankfully, with the rear end of his car mode instead hanging behind
his legs near the ankles; I quite like this take, as those little bits
of his Camaro mode on his hips/knees nearly always bugged me. The mold
detailing on Bumblebee's robot parts is quite accurate to his movie model,
with pistons, a fake gas cap, and the like molded onto the various parts
of his body. His headsculpt is spot-on, though he can't flip down his battlemask
on this version like he could on some other versions. The plastic color
on his upper legs and arms is a really neat shade-- it's not paint, but
it almost looks like it is, being a rather metallic-looking shade of gunmetal
gray (see, Hasbro? THIS is how you do gray plastic). All this said, beyond
the head this mode is pretty sparse in paint apps, the toes being the only
other robot parts painted; a few more metallic gunmetal gray paint apps
wouldn't have hurt, particularly around the waist. For articulation, Bumblebee
can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points),
hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles (at two points)--
in other words, standard deluxe movie 'Bee articulation. As a gimmick,
'Bee's right arm has a push-missile launcher to give him some firepower.

    "High Octane" Bumblebee
is a pretty nice toy overall, with only a few minor kibble issues and lack
of paint in a few areas holding the toy back itself. If you're a Bumblebee
fan, but all means get this toy; that said, if you have a multiple deluxe
movie Bumblebee toys already, this general design doesn't add anything
new beyond having the same transformation applied to a retro Camaro; there
aren't many surprises regarding this toy, for better or worse.
