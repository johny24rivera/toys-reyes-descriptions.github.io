    Mold History
   </b>
   : Although based off
the deluxe version of the same character, the Spychanger version of X-Brawn
was a mold made exclusively for RiD.

    X-Brawn's vehicle mode
is a minivan. This version is a bit more "kiddie-fied" in its proportions
and general stubiness than its
    <a href="xbrawn.html">
     deluxe version
    </a>
    ,
but otherwise, it's pretty accurate. The only thing that throws one off
a little about this mode is that X-Brawn has a little "nub" sticking out
of the right side of his vehicle mode (necessary for transformation). No
real big deal, but it throws off the symmetry of this mode. One thing also
worth mentioning is that X-Brawn is the only Spychanger to have different-sized
wheels; the ones in the front are smaller than those in the back.

    X-Brawn's robot mode
is pretty accurate to his deluxe version, despite a pretty different transformation.
Hasbro even molded "tires" above his feet, even though his actual wheels
don't rotate to the front like they do on the deluxe version. However,
proportion-wise, X-Brawn's left arm is even bigger on this toy than it
is on the deluxe version, and it causes X-Brawn to tip over on that side
rather easily. Also, his robot fist doesn't actually come out the other
end of the van front, but is rather molded into the side, which kinda detracts
from the look a little. Also, he doesn't have any weapons to speak of,
so that limits his playability there. Another thing that limits how fun
this toy is is his lack of good articulation; his legs and head can't move
at all. However, his arms can move. The shoulder and elbow can move on
the right arm, and the shoulder in 2 parts and the elbow at one on the
left. The extra "car flaps" extending from the top of his leg sections
is also a bit detracting from the look, but this is present on the deluxe
version as well. X-Brawn's detailing, both mold-wise and paint-wise, is
very good in this mode, especially for such a small figure. The chest and
head are especially well-done.

    Although he's not as
great or well-proportioned as the deluxe version, the Spychanger X-Brawn's
still a decent toy. Not really playable with that much, but then again,
none of the Spychangers really are.
