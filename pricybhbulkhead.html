    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Bulkhead. For a review on the mold itself, read
the review of the original Prime "Robots in Disguise" commander Bulkhead

     As with most of the Beast
Hunters Autobots, Bulkhead is a heavy remold of his original "Robots in
Disguise" Prime toy of the same size class (in this case, the commander-sized
version). And what some awesome remolding Hasbro did! Bulkhead's vehicle
parts in particular are now very heavily armored, with padding-like detailng
and spikes everywhere on both the back and the front bumpers. The brown
spikes on the front in particular are insanely long-- be careful Bulky,
or you're going to impale someone on those things! This armored, spiky
look goes PERFECTLY with Bulkhead's new headsculpt, which now looks like
he's wearing a "beard" and a Viking helmet strikingly similar to a helmet
from the
     <i>
      Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
     </i>
     video game. (Dragonborn Bulkhead,
that's what I like to call this version.) He's also got an axe weapon,
which in vehicle mode has the bottom of the handle pointing forward and,
in a rather ingenious stroke, serves as a push-missile launcher in that
mode, with the handle being the projectile! The downside to this is that
when Bulkhead's holding his axe in robot mode, the axe head tends to swivel
around the missile-handle way too easily and a little loosely.

     Bulkhead's green is
still here on this version, but it's noticeably less prevalent and just
a TOUCH lighter than on the original version. The black is also in pretty
much the same places-- the wheels, windows, and bottom of the feet. The
big change here is that Bulkhead is sporting a lot of dull orange and brown.
The overall color scheme appears to make him a light homage to G1 Roadbuster--
another heavy-duty Autobot character-- though this could simply be a coincidence.
In general the more varied color scheme works well, with the orange working
well with both the brown and the green and giving Bulkhead a very "earthy"
tone. There's also a few bits of silver for places like his rear spikes,
headlights, taillights, and robot face, which helps to round the color
scheme out with a few accents.

Bulkhead is an excellent remold, and encompasses pretty much everything
I love out of the Beast Hunters remolds. He's got insane spikes added,
lots of armor-like detailing, a generally neat (if slightly flawed) weapon,
a more interesting color scheme, and a freaking VIKING HELMET. If that
doesn't sell you on this toy-- even if you already have a previous iteration
of this mold-- than you have no soul. No SOUL! (Or we just like different
things. Could be that, too.)
