    Well, Thundertron is
certainly a unique toy in the Prime toyline! He's the only beastformer
in the line before the "Beast Hunters" segment took over, and he's the
leader of a brand-new faction-- a band of space pirates called the Star
Seekers! (Unfortunately, there weren't any other of his band released,
at least at mass retail. Apparently the Star Seekers were going to be a
faction introduced part way through the series, but the concept got sidelined
in favor of the new Predacons. Regardless, at least he got to be in a few
novels.) Thundertron's beast mode is supposed to be a techno-organic lion,
but it looks a LOT more like a wolf, with its relatively lean proportions
and mane that's not really all that puffy or large, looking more like his
wolf head is simply sunk into the sides a bit. Overall, this mode looks
quite good, though it's a bit too obvious from its construction that Thundertron's
back end are simply his robot legs bent and pointed downwards, what with
the hips for the back legs being way too far forward on the main body,
like they're extending out from the sides of the upper stomach area. There's
an attempt to hide this with the long, stylized "blade"-style plastic pieces
on the sides of his upper back legs, but the illusion is broken easily
if you don't look at him at the right angle. There's also rather odd chunks
of extra... stuff... on his upper front legs, which fold out into his robot
arms. On a lesser note, his rubbery tail is also a bit shorter than I'd
like, and starts at the midsection, which, again, looks weird. These issues
aside, though, Thundertron looks quite menacing, his long claws and other
blade-like details being quite appropriate for a "Pirate" leader. His color
scheme is white, blue, and gray, and is pretty decent, if not the most
eye-catching. I particularly don't like the light milky gray, though at
least it's not THAT prevalent on the toy. He's also got some nice paint
apps, like the silver "fade" apps on his rear section pieces, some nice
bronze-gold and bronze-orange paint apps behind his front claws, and a
very well-painted wolf--er,
    <i>

    </i>
    -- face, with blue paint giving
emphasis to the brows and gold to the cheekbones and snout. The jagged
blue/white lines that go down the sides of his mane and shoulders also
look pretty darned cool. Thundertron's mold detailing is also quite intricate
for a Prime-universe toy-- yes, there are large areas where there's relatively
little detailing, with a slight stylized look on his rear armor bits, but
he's got quite a lot of pistons and the like on his legs, and patches of
finely-detailed, technorganic-looking "fur" on his shoulders, behind his
front claws, and on his main body. For articulation in this mode, Thundertron
can move at the rear shoulders (at two points), at the rear armor pieces,
and at the knees and ankles (at two points) on the rear feet; and at the
knees and ankles (at two points) on his front feet. Unfortunately because
of his transformation, he can't move his head, jaw, or shoulders on the
front legs, which is a bit of a bummer at this size. His tail can also
move up and down at the point where it connects to the body. Thundertron's
"Powerizer" weapon is a claw weapon which-- when you pull back on the blue
chunk of plastic above the claw-- causes a large transparent blue cutlass
to swing forward in front of the claw, with a red LED light coming on near
the base of the sword. The red LED SHOULD light up the transparent plastic,
but it doesn't light up much of it at all. Plus, you can't lock the weapon
into the "cutlass-deployed" mode, which means that most of the time you'll
just have a long, backwards-pointing cutlass, which just looks weird. I
wish they had put that budget towards a more effective weapon/gimmick.

    Thundertron's transformation
of his rear/lower section into robot mode is very straightforward and is
pretty much just folding out and around his legs, while his beast head
comes forward and down to reveal his robot head. This means that his robot
mode shares an awful lot of details with his beast mode, and-- particularly
below the waist-- looks too "sameish" as said beast mode-- I wish some
more details were unique to this mode. That said, the unconventional way
his arms transform-- with his front claws locking in and flanking his shoulders
in a really cool manner that enhances his silouhette-- is pretty different
from their beast mode configuration, though the flipside of this is that
it can be a little puzzling the first few times transforming said arms
back into beast mode. This is definitely the mode that had the most emphasis
from a design perspective, with only his tail really being a bonafide "extra"
in this mode. His proportions are generally quite good, and I love how
the long blade-like pieces from his lion mode form a "pirate coat" around
his lower section. His head design is also incredibly intricate and awesome,
his technorganic "fur" looking like slicked-back hair and a long beard,
with gold paint drawing out the "mustache" detailing amidst that beard
as well. His forehead is more angular and has some blue detailing on it
that makes it look a bit like some sort of pirate brim, and really it just
makes him BURST with character. I also like the aqumarine "mane hair" accenting
his head-chest along with the blue-and-white stripes that make the sides
of his body. The only weakness I feel he has with his proportions are that
his shoulders are a bit too low proportionally, and the detailing on them
tends to "run in" with the claw pieces that partially cover them, and is
definitely the weakest point of this mode. Thundertron can move at the
neck, shoulders (at three points, though they can be fiddly), elbows, inwards
at the wrists, and at the hips (at two points), knees, and ankles (at two
points) and at the rear heel-toes on his feet. Beyond his lame Powerizer
weapon, Thundertron's right foot can actually detach, giving him a bonafide
pirate "peg-leg". Meanwhile, the foot can actually be used as a claw weapon--
yes, he can actually rip off his own foot and beat you with it! This is
such an ingenious design choice, it's one of the highlights of the toy
for me. Thundertron has standard 5mm holes in his fists, but also on the
sides of his lower arms and on the sides of the blue block of his Powerizer
weapon, so you can arm him with other regular-scale Prime weapons on a
fair number of different areas. Thundertron's Powerizer weapon can also
hook into his back and SUPPOSEDLY light up some of his robot innards with
the blue transparent plastic and all, but it doesn't remotely work.

    Even though the back/bottom
half of his two modes definitely look too similar, in general Thundertron
is breath of fresh air for the Prime "Robots in Disguise" portion of the
line, giving us not only the first beastformer in the line but one who
has an incredibly unique robot mode with tons of cool "pirate-esque" accents,
including a "coat", a peg leg, and a long pirate-like beard feel to his
face. Even though his beast mode has a fair number of drawbacks, if you're
at all a beastformer or a pirate fan, this incredibly unique toy is a must-get.

      Ages ago, Thundertron swore that the
creatures that caused the destruction of his world would pay for their
crimes. Since then, he was wandered space in search of his revenge. His
ship is primed, his crew is willing, and at long last, Cybertron is in
his sights.
