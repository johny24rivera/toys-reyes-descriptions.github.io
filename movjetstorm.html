    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Jetfire. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Jetfire

     ,
Jetstorm has a rather dull, yet realistic, color scheme adorning his jet
mode. It's meant to be a bit of a desert camo scheme, given that Jetstorm
here is supposed to be a loose representation of the aircraft that dealt
the final blow to Scorponok in the movie. It does accomplish that, as a
light tannish white and a bronwish gray would work well against a desert
setting, but unfortunately it doesn't look very interesting at all. A red
line is run down the sides of Jetstorm's vehicle mode, and it does help
some, but other than that he's almost entirely tannish white or gray, which
just doesn't catch the eye very much and doesn't contrast all that well,
particularly from a top-down look. In robot mode, Jetstorm looks a bit
better, given that he has a dark color to offset all the light colors--
namely, the royal purple, which goes magnicently with the other colors.
However, there's far too little of it-- maybe if the entire arms and upper
legs were made of purple, it would have looked more eye-catching. The transparent
red parts on the head and tail help a little more, but again, the white
and gray are just so dominant they overpower the other colors almost completely.

     No mold changes have
been made to Jetstorm-- he also has all the same sound effects that Cybertron
Jetfire did, as well. He does come with a "standard" Decepticon Cyber Key
that all the other Cybertron repaints in the Movie line come with, though.

     Jetstorm's color scheme
fits the realistic look of the movie look, but that still doesn't save
it from being undeniably dull. My least favorite of the different color
schemes this mold has gotten so far, though the purple does help it some.

       Jetstorm believes that if he has to
get in a fight, he might as well fight dirty. He's spent ages perfecting
his fighting style, studying all the cheapest places to blast or stab another
robot. He's not the strongest or most dangerous fighter among the Decepticons,
but most Autobots would rather go up against anyone else. When Jetstorm
fights, he fights to win at all costs, so he does everything he can to
hurt his opponent as bad as possible. Even when he loses, it's very rate
that his enemies don't go away with shattered optics or limbs damaged beyond
repair.
