not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Voyager
class Bludgeon. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge

     Gigatron is a definite
homage to G1 Overlord, but he's named "Gigatron" for two reasons-- one,
copyright issues; and two, because unlike G1 Overlord (who became a tank
and a jet), this version only becomes a tank, and the name for his tank
mode was Giga. Kinda clever, actually, given that the name was already
in circulation. Anyways, in vehicle mode Gigatron represents Overlord's
tank mode to a tee, and looks good doing it; the moderately dark blue and
off-white play off each other very well as the main colors. There are numerous
secondary colors-- light orange on the vents, purple on the weapons, silver
on parts of the robot mode, aquamarine on the fronts of the tank mode and
lower legs, red on the tips of his missle launchers-- but pretty much every
one of them contrasts with the other colors well and really makes Gigatron's
color scheme eye-catching. The only one that I would say doesn't so much
are the gray on the treads, which would've looked a bit better as a solid
black to stand against the off-white and aquamarine. In robot mode, however,
his comparison to his G1 self falls completely flat-- simply put, although
it was a great body for Bludgeon, beyond the two large silver chest bits,
there's nothing that makes this robot mode look like his G1 version.

     Well, except for the
head sculpt, which is the only mold change made to Gigatron. It's based
off of how Overlord looks in the IDW comics as drawn by Nick Roche (which
was largely responsible for his recent popularity surge), but unfortunately
translating that look into 3D plastic made it lose how good it looked.
First off, the head's a bit large proportionally; also, the lips are a
bit TOO puffy, and his circular eyes have a rather blank stare on them
that is just off-putting (and definitely not in the way intended).

     I'm rather conflicted
when it comes to Botcon Gigatron. On one hand, it's a great mold with a
fantastic, eye-catching color scheme and loads of paint apps. The vehicle
mode is also a pretty good match to Overlord's "giga tank" mode. However,
the robot mode simply evokes nothing regarding Overlord, and the headsculpt
is pretty iffy. This toy in particular smells of getting a character into
a boxset because he's popular, and NOT because an existing mold adequately
evokes him.

       Forfeiting his throne at Polyhex to
his successor, Straxus, Gigatron turned to his inherent nomadic tendencies.
Thirsting for ever more power, he drifted with the eddies and currents
of the Dark Flow as he searched for that which would make him stronger.
He found it in a small blue sphere glowing brightly in the black. This
planet Earth was rich with resources and he could feel its potency, however,
he could sense another energy waiting to be tapped. Gigatron's craving
for power borders on the psychotic. He believes that he alone is befitting
of greatness and often resorts to violent sprees to provide evidence of
this. Although his body has been augmented several times as the result
of battle, his infrastructure remains a functional munitions factory. It
is capable of constructing a near endless variety of ordnance and launching
it thorugh his M68A1 105mm tank gun. In robot mode, Gigatron carries an
array of bladed melee weapons so that he may savor the damage he inflicts
in a close-quarter brawl.
