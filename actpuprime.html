    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     Armor Up Optimus Prime
here is a repaint homage to Star Convoy, a Japanese Prime whose trademark
paint app was a yellow "T"-like shape on his upper chest-- just like Armor
Up Optimus Prime sports. Beyond that and the now-silver (and rather cool-looking)
paint job the head has gotten, though, it's hard to tell what exactly has
changed between this version and the original Activator Prime. Indeed,
he is a "barely-repaint", but there's a few more changes than it would
at first appear:
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The black used on the windows is shinier
and now pastel like on the original release.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The entire vehicle headlights are now
yellow, as oppposd to just the round bits in the center.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - He has a silver Autobot symbol on his
left shoulder.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - Both of his sirens are light metallic
bluish silver, as opposed to the orignal Activator Prime's sirens, where
one was light red and the other was light blue.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - This Prime's upper legs are the same
blue as his lower legs, as opposed to being gray.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The entire lower chest and hip area are
painted gunmetal gray, minus the headlight yellow paint apps.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - Armor Up Optimus Prime's red is a SLIGHTLY
lighter shade than the original Activator Prime's.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - The dark blue plastic on this version
is the same shade, but has glittery bits in it as opposed to being a flat
shade.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     - Most of the connector pieces (primarily
seen on the back of the robot mode) are blue, not gray.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Still, almost all of these changes are
minor and make Armor Up Optimus Prime more of a variant than a bonafied
actual repaint. I understand Hasbro not wanting to have Prime stray too
far from his iconic colors, but this is still waaaay too similar to the
original.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to Armor Up Optimus Prime.

     Armor Up Optimus Prime
looks SLIGHTLY better than the original overall, I think, but that doesn't
change the fact that he's a "barely-repaint" who really could have used
some more variance in his colors. The mold is pretty bad in vehicle mode
as well, making this a hard recommendation unless you're THAT big of a
Star Convoy obsessionist.

       In preparation for a massed attack on
the Decepticons, Optimus Prime orders his Autobots to upgrade their armor.
Working with Autobot Ratchet, he mounts improved armor plating on his frame,
giving him the toughness he needs to withstand even the most powerful fusion
blast.
