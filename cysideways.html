    Everyone's favorite faction-switching
transformer is back, and this time as a futuristic spacecraft! And a really,
really, REALLY cool-looking one at that. It has a very angular design,
especially on the wings, and the cockpit windows on the front look like
spooky eyes-- this mode just drips evil, it makes you wonder how anyone
could mistake Sideways as an Autobot. The color scheme of orange, silver,
black, and bronze with some green sccents also looks GREAT, and adds all
the more to the evil-ness of this mode. Sideways is also covered with both
mold and paint detailing-- I especially like the green-and-silver patterns
on the back of his wings and the lots of technical detailing on the mold
going in certain lines across Sideways' structure. There's also a cool-looking
sun-like gold pattern above Sideways' cockpit that's also on the other
Planet X toy in the line- I wonder if it actually is used for something
on the show, or if it's just a decoration they both share... Two rather
inconsequential complaints about this mode-- first off, though he has little
wheels on the bottom of this mode to roll him along on a hard surface,
Sideways doesn't have any actual extendable or retractable landing gear
like most other Transformer aircraft of his size. Also, there's no real
thrusters in the back, if you look at him from a rear angle, though the
Cyber Key slot looks kind of like one if the key isn't plugged into it.

    As cool as Sideways'
vehicle mode looks, though, his robot mode even leaves THAT in the dust.
This is the epitome of robot modes, folks-- it's one of the best I've ever
seen. It may even be THE best, I'm still unsure on that. The look, the
proportions, the massive sword-cleaver and splayed-blade weapons on his
hands, the angles, the face-- it all just looks so incredibly COOL. He
looks pretty lithe with the skinny waist and upper legs, but it still fits
in very well with his look. His head also looks incredibly cool-- the horns
and the... NOTHING inside his angular "helmet" definitely fit a Unicron
spawn such as himself. I don't know if this was intentional or just a happy
accident because of the design of the mold, but if you look into the orange
transparent plastic he has for a face, you can see shadows of eyes and
a mouth in there. Soooooooo cool.... Sideways also has great articulation--
he can move pretty much anywhere except the waist, including rotating his
wrists! Sideways' Cyber Key gimmick activates two things-- if you push
the key into his slot behind the weapon mounted on his left arm, four blades
splay out in front of the weapon, AND his allegiance symbol changes from
Autobot to Decepticon. (If you take out the key, the blades still stay
splayed but the symbol reverts back to Autobot.) There's a spring mechanism
that will pop out the key if you jiggle it a little, however, so be a tad
careful about that. It's not too big of a problem. The other small complaint
I have with this mode is that there's a couple of plastic pieces attached
to the sides of his legs that don't quite mesh with the surroudning pieces.

    Cybertron Sideways is
an absolutely incredible Transformer, my definite personal favorite of
the $10-and-under Transformers I have, and pretty much a tie with a few
others I have for my favorite Transformer of all time. He just looks so
incredibly awesome in both modes, pretty much everything about him is just
perfect. HIGHLY recommended!

      A con man from the day he first came
online, Sideways is a master of deception, mixing just enough truth into
his lies to keep both his enemies and his allies off guard. His tongue
is as sharp as his sword, always ready with another trick of language to
keep his marks guessing at his true intentions; at least long enough to
jam a hidden blade through their anterior power units.
