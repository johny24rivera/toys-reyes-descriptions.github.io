    Highbrow here is a "lite"
homage to the G1 character of the same name-- mostly because he's got an
alt mode with two primary rotors, though beyond that and his allegiance,
that's about as far as the homage goes. But I like the general alt mode
change as Highbrow has a REALLY unique alt mode that, to me, is one of
the main selling points of the toy. He bears a striking resemblance to
a WWII P-38 Lightning, which-- as can obviously be seen-- has a very unique
shape. Despite this, Highbrow remains remarkably robot kibble-free in this
mode-- his chest sticks out a little bit from beneath the center section,
but other than that this is a very solid mode, and the proportions are
quite well-done, as well. The dark military green is a fitting color for
a military plane, though the light blue (more visible in robot mode) is
simply a way too light, "pastel-ish" color that doesn't really fit with
the green at all-- in fact, I'd say it borderline clashes with the dark
green. It's just an ugly combination, his two main colors. The secondary
colors-- like his various shades of gray-- fit well with his alt mode,
though, and a couple of the silver and gold accents help to break up the
green a bit (though he could still use a few more paint apps near the rear
end of this mode). Highbrow's mold detailing is incredibly well-done--
little "rivets" are EVERYWHERE on this guy, and little details like the
intakes on his rotary engines and the seat inside his little transparent
cockpit make all the difference. Highbrow also has three retractable landing
gear, though I wish they didn't make his vehicle mode point upward so much
when all deployed, as it makes it a little more difficult to photograph/display
at a nice angle in this mode without the blue robot chest on the underside
making itself known more than it should. As for gimmicks, by pressing down
on either of the gold engines behind his rotors, you can cause said rotor
to spin. It's a pretty neat little gimmick, though it should be noted that
the rotors don't spin entirely freely-- they're on a geared system, so
as soon as you stop pressing the button up and down the respective rotor
will stop.

    Highbrow's robot mode
is generally well-done for the most part, but it does have a few weaknesses.
Let's start with the good stuff-- he carries over the excellent mold detailing
from his vehicle mode, and his proportions are generally pretty good (though
his legs are a bit long and the hips a tad wide). His landing gear integrates
remarkably well with his chest design, to boot. I love the way that his
mini-wings with the missiles form a sort of a "skirt" at the side of his
hips, and the rotary guns on top of said wings can be taken off and put
in his hands for a bit of handheld firepower. The way his rotors collapse
on his lower arms is also pretty cool, too, as is the fold-down visor on
his robot face (which, when flipped down, looks like a WWII pilot's helmet).
Highbrow's articlulation is also pretty good-- he can move at the neck,
shoulders (at
    <i>
     five
    </i>
    points), elbows (at two points), inwards at the
wrists, and he can move at the hips (at three points), knees, and ankles
(at two points). His "toes" can also move at one point on the central one
on each foot and two points on the outer one. Alright, now for the bad
stuff-- most notably, Highbrow's hands are just OFF. Presumably because
of the rotor gimmick, they're way too far "outwards" when compared to the
upper arms, and just look really odd, there's no getting around it. Also,
his robot face is an ugly mesh of a movie face-- often I like the movie
aesthetic, but this face just doesn't look so hot, with the lips too pronounced
and the face otherwise too smooth (though the light piping on his clear
eyes works quite well with his visor up). There's some fairly obvious vehicle
mode kibble on his back, made up of the segmented parts of his cockpit.
They don't get in the way of articulation or anything, but they don't lock
firmly into place either, and just sort of hang there unceremoniously.
On some lesser notes, Highbrow's heels are a bit odd (being so long and
so flat), and the tab that holds the halves of his waist together can come
undone a little if you try to move his legs outward at the hips (though
it's not a complete disconnection).

    Autobot Alliance Highbrow
has a great, unique vehicle mode and a pretty good robot mode as well--
though the latter falls short in a few places, such as the odd placement
of his hands and the blatant back kibble. His color scheme also borders
on bad. Other than those couple of quibbles, he's a great mold and I'd
mildly recommend him-- though he's also the version of this mold I'd recommend
the least.

      You don't get as old as Highbrow without
fighting a lot of desperate, can't-win battles. He's been through his share,
and come out on top, every time. The Fallen may be ancient and nearly all-powerful,
but Highbrow is pretty old himself, and he's learned a lot of tricks over
the years. Paired up with Autobot Ratchet, he's sure The Fallen will be
surprised to learn just how tough two determined Autobots can be.
