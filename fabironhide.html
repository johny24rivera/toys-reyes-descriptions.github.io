    Ironhide's vehicle mode,
a GMC Topkick, is a bit kiddy in its proportions, though this is more acceptable
than on a mainline toy because Fast Action Battlers are specifically made
for younger kids, of course. (The use of semi-chibi proportions on some
Fast Action Battlers but not others is curious, though.) With the exception
of the feet being rather visible from the backside, and the very front
tips of the legs poking out from the underside of this mode, there's no
robot extras in Topkick mode, which is always appreciated. As expected
for a Fast Action Battler, though, it is a bit more "toyish" than most
of the toys in the main movie line, with more obvious hinges and such than
on the larger Voyager-sized

    . The painted metallic blue windows do provide some badly-needed
contrast against the black, though, since Ironhide really doesn't have
a secondary color in this mode. The other mold and paint detailing is adequate,
but not much above that-- certain things like Ironhide's back bumper or
truck bed could have been detailed a bit more. Otherwise, this is a pretty
solid mode for a toy aimed at a younger age bracket.

    Ironhide's robot mode
is great... from the waist down. His truck door panels on the sides of
his legs aren't the most sightly extras, but they stay out of the way well
enough and it certainly makes the transformation a lot simpler than Voyager
Ironhide's. Ironhide's legs (and head and arms) also have oodles of mold
detailing on them, which is great since the vehicle mode was rather bereft
of such detailing. There's also some great paint apps on Ironhide, too,
especially on the legs and head-- the gold really contrast well with the
black. The secondary mold color, a dull bluish green (which is not on the
Voyager Ironhide toy) adds a much-needed secondary color to the toy and
looks good against the black while still being fairly movie-accurate as
well, like it's sort of similar to a "dirty black". The head sculpt on
Ironhide is great, just like on his Voyager version, with tons of details
everywhere and a bit of an overall resemblance to a bull wearing a cowboy
hat-- which is, of course, PERFECT given Ironhide's personality. Ironhide's
chest and arm construction, however, is simply horrid, regardless of what
age bracket the toy's aimed at. Ironhide's chest is up so high it looks
like he's struggling to see over it, and his arms DON'T rotate forward
at the wheels, which could have made them look normal in their placement
and made this mode a lot, LOT better. Instead, for some stupid reason,
the arms are stuck behind the truck front halves that form Ironhide's chest
and shoulders and can't point forward, so Ironhide's arms are eternally
aimed at an angle like he's sticking his chest out with his arms behind
him. It looks really awkward, not to mention that his left cannon, which
is a standard spring-loaded missile-firing weapon, can't fire straight
because of this. The vehicle roof panel behind Ironhide's head is also
pretty kibbly-looking and just hangs there without contributing anything
to the look of the mode. Ironhide's articulation is also rather limited
in this mode-- he can move at the hips, knees, up-and-down at the shoulders,
and can rotate at the elbows. Most of the arm movement, as already mentioned,
can't actually make his arms point forward. His waist can also rotate,
but it has that weird "rotate only to the left and snaps back after you
let go of it" waist movement that most Fast Action Battlers have. His head
can move EVERY so slightly from side-to-side, but it's so minute it's barely
worth mentioning.

    Cannon Blast Ironhide
has a decent, if pretty toyish vehicle mode, but his robot mode looks downright
ludicrous with this absurd shoulders and oddly positioned arms. Unless
you're buying this toy for Junior who's way too young to transform a mainline
TF, just save up another $10 and get the FAR superior mainline Voyager
Ironhide instead.

      As Autobot weapon specialist, Ironhide
is as tough as they come. Gruff, grim, and always ready for a fight, theres
no problem he cant handle with the application of a little firepower from
his cannon arm. Now that hes on Earth, he just hopes they dont find the
AllSpark before he gets the chance to dent some Decepticon fenders.
