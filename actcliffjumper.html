    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Cliffjumper is a straight-up
homage to his G1 character, and like most Cliffjumpers nowadays, he's a
repaint of Bumblebee. However, he does have a head remold, something that's
fairly unique for a Cliffjumper-- the head is now show-accurate, complete
with the HUUUUUGE chin even by Animated standards. In fact, because of
the size of the chin, his head articulation is slightly more restricted
than Activator Bumblebee's. The head itself is sculpted quite well, though,
with some nice paint apps on the forehead and "sideburns".

     The color scheme is
pretty standard for ol' Cliffjumper-- red makes up most of the color scheme,
with some black to serve as a contrast color. There's also some bluish
gray, which looks quite nice and goes well with the other main colors.
The gunmetal gray windows are also a nice touch, as well. The necessary
details, such as the headlights and tailights, are painted as well. However,
as far as "dynamic" paint apps go, Cliffjumper doesn't really have any
of those-- no racing stripes or decals or anything like that, he's just
a normal red car.

     Animated Cliffjumper
may be a little "plain"-looking when compared to some of the more dyamically-painted
Animated toys, but it's still a good color scheme with some decent contrast
colors and a nicely done retooled head (which, to be honest, wasn't totally
necessary, though certainly appreciated). Even ignoring the fact that you
can buy Animated Bumblebee at other price points but this is the only Cliffjumper
toy in the line, I'd still wholeheartedly recommend this over any of the
other releases of this Activator mold, as the color scheme looks much better.

       Because of his temper, Cliffjumper has
never been much of a spy. Even though he works in Intelligence, he doesn't
interact much with the enemy. Instead, he collects information from field
agents and finds the important bits for his superiors. Of course, knowing
everything there is to know about the Decepticons makes him a little tense,
which is why he's always ready for a fight.
