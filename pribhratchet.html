    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" deluxe Autobot Ratchet figure. For a review on the mold itself,
read the review of the original Prime "Robots in Disguise" deluxe Ratchet
figure

     Like most of the Beast
Hunters "upgrades", Ratchet here is an extensive remold of his original
"Robots in Disguise" toy. As opposed to most Beast Hunters toys-- where
the remolded parts tend to "blend in" fairly well with the parts of the
mold that were kept the same-- Ratchet's remolded bits in vehicle mode
are blatantly obvious. His middle section of his vehicle mode is still
a smooth-looking ambulance, but then all of sudden at both ends everything
becomes haphazard-looking and gains a tremendous amount of spikes and additional
mold detailing, which is at times impressively intricate-- there's even
a large turbo engine exhaust port molded in on the vehicle's back! Colored
spikes on the front and back, exposed engine, and dragon-like armor scales
are other obvious remolds here. He's also got a new weapon, with is a drill
that can open up to reveal a gatling gun in the center. Even better, by
pressing in rapidly on the orange slider, you can make the green drill
halves twirl around the gatling gun quickly, like a rotor blade. It's quite
addictive. In robot mode, most of these spikes carry over, though they're
a bit less prominent and more "spread out" in this mode so the "new mismatched"
parts aren't quite as obvious. Ratchet's head is been remolded, making
him look especially fierce, with ridged chin sides, a monocle on one of
his eyes, and what look like fangs around his mouth. This-- combined with
the rest of his fierce appearance, the remolded chest that has a green
"spark crystal"-like detail, and his weapon-- seem to make him a "light"
homage to
     <a href="dinobottm2.html">
      Transmetal II Dinobot
     </a>
     , of all toys.
It's a rather cool, unexpected homage, though I don't think by and large
it fits Ratchet well.

     Ratchet's color scheme
is where this mold-- unfortunately-- largely falls apart. The white of
his original form has been kept, but mostly only for the middle section
of his vehicle mode and the "heartbeat" stripes on the sides, which don't
blend in at all with the haphazard patches of dull brownish red plastic,
gray, and light tan mixed w/ light pale orange plastic used on most of
Ratchet's other visible parts mode. Worse, the "panel lines" on the back
half of the vehicle are made more obvious with mismatched colors, with
the red paint very noticeably not matching the dull brownish red plastic
used for most of the roof. A bit of gray also unsightly sticks out on each
side. On the plus side, the dull brownish red plastic is a very nice color,
being a bit different from the original release while still recognizably
being part of Ratchet's usual white-and-red scheme. The green and light
silver blue paint apps contrast against their surrounding colors excellently,
as does the turquoise and green used for Ratchet's weapon, and the light
orange and silver make for decent accent paint apps. The light tan w/ light
orange mixed in, however, is just an ugly color on anything but a desert
vehicle-- it just looks too rusty and sandy. Additionally, the clear plastic
windows allow one to see the robot bits inside Ratchet's windows VERY obviously,
and the number of accent and secondary colors-- while okay by themselves
or in contrast with one or two colors, as I've mentioned-- are a bit too
numerous in terms of tones/shades overall on the figure, to the point where
Ratchet looks a bit too busy (again, particularly in vehicle mode).

     Beast Hunters Ratchet
has some excellent, detailed remolding done-- even though it doesn't "match
up" with the unremolded parts in vehicle mode or fit his character very
well, it certainly does make him look more visually interesting in both
modes. However, his color scheme is a train wreck, with two many different
colors and shades of colors all crashing together to make him look rusty,
worn-down, and a bit ugly (and not in a good way). If it was just the mold
changes I'd rate this higher than the original "Robots in Disguise" Prime
Ratchet toy, but because of the mismatched color scheme this is one of
the few Beast Hunters "upgrades" that scores lower than its original version.

        Autobot Ratchet scowls at the data discs
recovered from the Decepticon lab by Smokescreen. Most of them are useless--
charred or cracked by the same plasma blasts that had rendered the Autobot
warrior himself nearly unable to return to base. But a few have shocking
information on them. Information that not only reveals much about the cloning
process used to bring the Predacons back to life, but also about the secrets
of the powerful new weapons recovered by Bumblebee.
