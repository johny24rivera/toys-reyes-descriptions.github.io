    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Energon Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original Energon

     The repaint of Energon
Starscream has a more typical "Starscream-ish" color scheme than the original
paint job. The familiar reds, grays, and blacks are all present on the
repaint of Starscream. And although it's a good color scheme by itself,
it's also, I think, one of my complaints about the paint job; it's just
been done on practically every Transformer named Starscream to date, and
it's getting a little old by now. Hasbro did throw in more blue than the
"classic" scheme had to mix things up a little, but still, the new scheme
just screams "been there, done that" to me. Also, Starscream is no longer
an "Energon ghost" like he was in this mold's original paint job, so his
transparent plastic, as well as the green paint-apped "battle damage",
is gone. Fair enough, even if I did rather like the battle damage paint
apps. But Hasbro didn't even bother to remold the toy enough to take away
the battle damage shown on the mold; instead, it's just painted over this
time, in an effort to tell us "lalalala, it's not heeere, don't look at
it"! It's just lazy, really. And getting rid of the transparent plastic
also creates some oddities in colors among the arms, as now Starscream's
left arm is mostly blue in parts where his other arm isn't, even if the
front of the left shoulder is painted gray. As for the positives, Starscream's
paint apps are well-placed for the most part, clean, and look pretty good;
I especially like the teal paint apps on his arms, they're a really nice-looking
color. Though I'm not sure why the cockpit window is now opaque; I thought
it looked kinda cool when it was transparent, as you could see the pilot
seats inside...

     The Starscream "Energon"
redeco is an okay repaint, and has a good color scheme by itself, but the
same basic scheme has just been done on every Starscream toy so far, and
it's getting old. On the original paint job of a mold, I can understand,
but a repaint of a mold should be a little more special than this. Also,
the fact that the battle damage on the mold has been completely ignored
kinda irks me. Thus, I'd probably recommend the original Energon Starscream
over this version, even though this version certainly isn't bad.
