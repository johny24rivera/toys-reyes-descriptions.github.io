    Vehicle mode is a...
really funky tank. I don't think any real-life tanks have huge arrow-missiles
on the sides of them, nor big air bellows making up the body of the tank.
And I certainly HOPE no tanks have that awful blue-green and yellow coloration.
I mean, I know they're trying to hearken back to the G1 Bludgeon, who was
also a tank (inside his pretender shell) and also had a partially green-and-yellow
color scheme, but... blech. Heck, practically any color scheme I can think
of not involving pink would have been better than this. The stuff really
clashes, and isn't fitting at all of a tank. The white stripes don't help
much, either. At least the tank "wheels" are individually chromed, which
is a nice touch (even though they aren't real wheels, just engravements
in the plastic- four smaller, real wheels are on the bottom of the toy).
Another problem I have with this mode is that the main body of the tank
doesn't stand together very well- see, the sides of the main body are made
up of the robot arms, and there's absolutely NOTHING holding them in place-
no pegs or anything, so they swivel around on their joint as much as they
want to. As for Bludgeon's gimmick, it's rather cool, if you can get it
going- place a missile on the tank turret, then SLAM in the air bellow
to fire it. It only really works if you REALLY smack that bellow hard,
though, which usually ends up messing up the rest of the tank mode... *sigh*
Once you do get it going, though, it fires FAR. Like, 10 feet.

    Bludgeon's robot mode
wouldn't be so bad (ignoring the color scheme, of course) if it wasn't
for his rather loose joints in this mode. And it isn't just mine- I've
heard of numerous reports of this thing having unsatisfactory joints everywhere
but the knees, which for some reason are nice and tight. This makes him
rather floppy, as you can imagine. This is a shame, since his articulation
is pretty good- he has head, shoulders (at two points each), elbow (at
two points each), waist, hip, and knee articulation. The overall LOOK of
the mode is nice, though- nicely balanced, and I love the big launcher
on the shoulder. The chest is a bit big proportionally, though, but you
sorta get used to that when you're talking Transformers. Bludgeon also
has no heels on his legs, which makes it rather easy for him to fall over
backwards. A "running pose" is the best pose for keeping him stable, as
seen above, and even then, it doesn't do that well of a job. Oh, and Bludgeon
also comes with a "normal" gun that doesn't do anything that you can stick
in his hand in this mode. Don't worry, it's storable in his tank mode.
My only other complaint about Bludgeon's robot mode is the head- it's too...
recognizable. I mean, practically everyone who knows anything about Transformers
knows what Megatron's head looks like, and that is unmistakably Megatron's
head. In fact, while I was typing this review, half the time I typed "Bludgeon"
I almost typed "Megatron". He's just... so familiar a character that your
brain keeps telling you he's the leader of the Decepticons, and not just
some foot soldier. A little remolding on the head to make him less recognizable
would have been appreciated.

    Bludgeon is a so-so
toy- he certainly has his good points, such as his big turret and well-proportioned
robot mode- but his tank mode doesn't stay together very well, his joints
are floppy, and his color scheme is atrocious. I'd recommend
