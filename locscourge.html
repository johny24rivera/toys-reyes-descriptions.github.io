     Scourge's dragon mode
is rather accurate to his larger Ultra-sized version when it comes to design
and detailing, but oddly enough, it's not very accurate when it comes to
color placement. Yes, Scourge does have the same general color scheme on
this smaller version (minus the yellow), but the majority of the main body
was dark gray, not orange like on this version. It still looks alright,
though I wish a bit more paint detailing were used on his main body-- with
all that great mold detailing, it really needs some paint highlights to
bring it out. A few slight proportional quibbles, as well-- the tail looks
far too stiff and triangular, and really need some articulation in there,
or at least mold it in a slightly curved position or something. The robot
hands are also easily visible on the backside of the front legs, though
I'm not sure if something like that could be fixed on a toy this size while
still making it accurate to its larger version. The dragon heads look great,
however-- my sole complaint being that Scourge's dragon eyes are a bit
too far back on the head, but that's a really small quibble. What's cool
is that Scourge's main dragon head can actually move at the base of the
head, which the larger version can't do! The minor dragon heads can move
at the point where they connect to the body, but not in the middle of their
necks like on the Ultra version.

     I'm not really fond
of Scourge's robot mode proportions, for the some reason that his legs
are too short proportionally, and they're molded in a slightly-bending
position, making them look even shorter. It throws the rest of Scourge's
look off, and makes him look like an angry midget. His hands also look
mighty weird, as they now have the dragon front feet on the back of them
as extras, just like the fists themselves were extras in dragon mode. A
plus, though, is that Scourge has above-average articulation for a Legends
of Cybertron toy-- he can move a the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, and
ankles, and all of these are on ball joints. The only real articulation
drawbacks Scourge has that his larger version didn't is the fact that the
dragon heads on his shoulders can't face directly forward because of their
limited movement, so they're always pointed up a little. Also, the lack
of knee articulation when some clearly could have been added is a bit of
a downer.

     Legends of Cybertron
Scourge has some very nice mold detailing and pretty good articulation
for a toy of his size, but some proportional problems in his robot mode
and a few extra problems in his dragon mode, coupled with his lack of paint
detailing is said mode, make me hesitant to recommend him over the Ultra-sized
version, even at the reduced price. His large version just looks so much
more menacing.
