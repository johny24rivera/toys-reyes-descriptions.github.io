      Vector Prime's personal
Minicon Safeguard has a color scheme that is a simplified version of Vector
Prime's himself, just like on the original version. The dull golden tan
isn't my favorite color, but it's by no means particularly ugly, and it
doesn't clash with black, Safeguard's secondary color. My main complaint
with Safeguard has to do with his lack of paint apps-- his forehead and
face are painted a nice shade of red, but other than that Safeguard doesn't
have any paint apps to speak of. I understand that Vector Prime should
take priority over his Minicon when it comes to looking good, but still...
just two or so more paint apps would have gone a long way.

        The idea behind the Galaxy
Force upgraded version of Vector Prime-- named after the Japanese version
of Cybertron, which is called Galaxy Force-- is that the colors are based
off of the original computer animation model Hasbro recieved for Vector
Prime in the TV show. They weren't sure why, but the animators in Japan
had colored their model a dull brown and black for this computer animation
"test shot", so Hasbro decided to use that for inspiration for this repaint.
Unfortunately, though the color scheme as a whole was fairly well thought-out,
the dull goldish tan used as the primary color just isn't all that great
of a shade, it looks too plain and "unclean" for an ancient master of time
and space like Vector Prime. The black, Vector Prime's secondary color,
does go very well with it, however, and the metallic and transparent orange
looks very good against the black as well, though I wish it was just a
tad darker so it would show more contrast against the goldish tan. The
same goes for the silver, as well-- it contrasts very well witht he black,
but it's too light to provide much contrast against the tan. Maybe using
more black and less tan would have made the toy look a bit better. The
dark metallic blue used for Vector Prime's face and bulb in his chest is
a very eye-catching color, though, and is probably the best-looking shade
on the figure.

         Galaxy Force Vector Prime
&amp; Safeguard are interesting ideas for repaints, with an interesting
story behind their color scheme, but ultimately they don't work as well
for the toy as the lighter, more "holier" colors of the original release.
The original official pictures of the toy showed Vector Prime being covered
in a very shiny metallic gold color, similar in shiny-ness to

          Cybertron

         </a>
         silver, but unfortunately it was shown that that photo
was waaay over-doctored. It's a shame, as if Galaxy Force had come out
in that shiny gold color, he would have defintiely surpassed the original
in terms of looks. As it is, he falls short-- I recommend the original
release over this one.
