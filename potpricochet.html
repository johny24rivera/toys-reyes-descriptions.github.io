    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to PotP Jazz. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of PotP Jazz

     Ricochet follows the
"general outline" of previous Jazz redecoes into this character, with the
color scheme more-or-less flipped from Jazz- that is, he's mostly black
with white as a secondary color, as opposed to visa versa. In vehicle mode
he's almost all black, with the white only showing through on the roof,
his Prime armor, and on some parts you can see inside the tinted clear
windows. In robot mode the white is much more obvious, on his upper arms,
hips, head, fists, and part of the chest, the vent details on his lower
legs are also painted white. It's already a nice "reverse" color scheme,
but really what makes the scheme is the gold, most visible on the flames
on the front and sides of the car mode. The nice shade of metallic gold
used for these flames-- along with some dark red in the middle of these
portions-- really looks spectacular against the black. Most of the rest
of the gold paint on Ricochet is of a duller, more mustard-y variety; that
is, the paint used on his rear fin, wheel hubs, part of the front windshield,
face and visor, front grill, and robot waist and feet. I'm not sure why
Hasbro did this-- I think the more straightforward, metallic gold looks
a little better. However, it still looks good overall, and it, the black,
and the white come together to form quite an eye-catching, nice color scheme
that's particularly varied in robot mode. Additionally, there's two additional
colors on the chest-- first, some silver on the bottom rim, and also some
light blue on the backside of the headlights to make said headlights a
transparent light blue. It helps add even more colors to the center mass
of the robot.

     Ricochet is definitely
one of the best redecoes from the "Power of the Primes" line, even if it
mostly follows the template set by his earlier redecoes. The black, white,
and gold really scheme really tends to pop, and the three major colors
are spread throughout the toy quite efficiently. I do wish they had used
a more metallic gold for most of those paint apps, but that's a small quibble--
overall this is a highly recommended buy, and better-looking than Jazz,
in my opinion.
