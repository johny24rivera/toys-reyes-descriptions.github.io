    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Dinobot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
Beast Wars Dinobot

     This time around, the
Dinobot mold is Grimlock (again), the leader of the original Dinobots.
Like most of the other Transformers: Dinobots, Grimlock here has a color
scheme that is a throwback to the old G1 Dinobots. He's gray and dull gold,
with some red stripes thrown in to liven up the color scheme a bit. And
though it does work some, Grimlock still needs a better variety of colors-
only those three make up 95% of his color scheme. The gold is also a bit
too milky for it too really shine like gold coloration should, so I don't
really like it that much.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Also worthy of note is that Grimlock has
a slight mold change from his predecessors- this time around, due to increasing
safety standards in the U.S., the sword on this mold was remolded by being
shortened and by being made of a much softer, bendier plastic. Not only
does the sword not stick out of the shield cone in beast mode to make up
the tip of his tail, but it's far too dull and bendy now to really make
a convincing sword. Meh.
    </font>

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Grimlock is inferior
to the original Dinobot mold, due to the ugly milky gold and the bendy
sword, but he's cheaper. So perhaps for you the cheaper price is worth
it, maybe not...
