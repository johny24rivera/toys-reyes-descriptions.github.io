    Beast mode is a dragon.
This mode looks pretty crummy, all things considered. For one, Megatron
HAS NO ARMS! Not even any detailed into the plastic "wings" behind his
main body! Rather poor planning in that part. His "wings" aren't even shaped
like wings, they're just the halves of his cloak of his robot mode with
wings painted on the inside. Megatron's head is also colored very oddly
in this mode as well; that light teal is just nauseating when connected
directly to the white and red. It's very out of place. The detailing on
this toy is rather nice, however.

    Robot mode isn't really
a robot mode at all. It's just a half-cloak with Megatron's head sticking
out of it. No moving parts at all in this mode, which kinda ruins the fun
of it- not even arms on the cloak like there was in the show! There are
little arms molded to the sides of the cloak, though. The head might have
actually been menacing, if it wasn't for the fact that the dragon chin
and mouth sticks out from the top of it, making Megatron look like a "conehead".
Very bad indeed.

    A pretty bad toy. I'd
think twice about getting it even if you ARE a completist.
