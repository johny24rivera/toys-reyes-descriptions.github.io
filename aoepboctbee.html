    Bumblebee's alternate
mode for his earlier-in-the-movie "High Octane" version is an old '70 Camaro,
but in "reverse colors" from his usual color scheme. That is, most of him
is black, with his usual yellowish orange "cheesy" yellow being more of
an accent color. This is particularly apparent in vehicle mode, where the
only yellow is on the bordered stripes around the grill and on the Autobot
symbols on the front sides; almost the entire rest of this mode is black
plastic, though the windows are thankfully painted a rather nice shade
of metallic silvery blue that contrasts against the black very well. The
rear windows aren't painted, but in Hasbro's defense these parts fold in
on themselves during transformation, and to paint the back windows would
have highlighted the gaps in between the plastic pieces there, so this
is one of the few times I'm glad paint WASN'T added. I still would've liked
paint on the headlights, taillights, or wheel rims, though. The lack of
both paint detailing and a relative lack of mold detailing in most places
(other than the tires and the grill) makes this mode look a little bland
overall. That said, the proportions are pretty spot-on, and the only robot
mode extras are little bumps on the back end that form the robot toes,
so those are two huge pluses.

    Although his transformation
is pretty simple-- as is basically required for a toy in the Power Battler
subline-- Bumblebee's robot mode looks significantly different from his
vehicle mode, with a rather intuitive transformation that involves folding
up much of his car mode origami-style into his lower legs, with most of
his "robot parts" being hidden inside the interior of the vehicle mode.
The end result is a robot mode that has some definite pluses and minuses.
First, the minuses-- 'Bee's lower legs aren't all that convincing, with
the "front" mold detailing and feet further out front than the upper legs
and generally having a very unpleasant, unnaturally segmented look to them.
The beefy car sides on the sides of the legs also look pretty weird from
the side, as they're bulkier than the entire upper body (the latter of
which admittedly SHOULD be a bit bulkier than it is from a side angle,
but still). The front sides of the car mode also don't really have anywhere
to go, and just hang unceremoniously from Bumblebee's arm pits, not really
locking in anywhere or getting out of the way by any measure. That said,
Bumblebee's main body is proportioned fairly well (though the chest should
poke forward a bit more), and the mold detailing on his robot parts is
pretty good, with the approporiate springs, armor plating, and the like
all molded in where it should be. (However, the lack of significant door
wings on this version is odd.) His headsculpt is also spot-on with some
nice metallic blue eyes and a gunmetal gray face. The paint detailing on
his chest and waist is also quite good (the grill-chest is completely fake),
and all the additional orange-yellow paint and plastic helps break up this
mode and make it considerably more visually interesting than the vehicle
mode. The orange-yellow paint is of a noticeably lighter, glossier shade
than the plastic, though, the latter of which is actually orange much more
than it is yellow, in contrast to most of movie 'Bee's other toys. High
Octane Bumblebee has a pretty good Power Battler gimmick-- squeeze his
legs together and his entire upper body rotates to the side, with him pointing
his right arm forward right as the cannon piece on it envelops the hand,
like he's about to fire off a shot. His head stays in place despite the
rest of his upper body rotating, and it's a very well-excecuted, fun gimmick.
However, the articulation otherwise is pretty sub-par-- he can move his
knees backward, his left shoulder out to the side, and TECHNICALLY his
right shoulder out to the side as well, though the cannon will automatically
come over his hand if you do this, and it springs back to its default position
as soon as you let it go. Even for a Power Battler, that's a little disappointing.

    The Power Battler version
of "High Octane" Bumblebee has both some big positives and some big negatives.
He has some pretty obnoxious kibble in robot mode, particularly under his
arm bits and on his lower legs, and his vehicle mode could use some more
paint. His articulation is also a little sub-par even for this subline.
However, his robot mode DOES have a good number of paint apps, his vehicle
mode is VERY solid, his transformation intuitive yet simple, and his gimmick
just plain fun. Overall I'd say he's one of the better Power Battler toys,
and I'd recommend him the most if you want a "simple" High Octane Bumblebee
toy.
