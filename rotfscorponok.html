    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Movie deluxe
Scorponok toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Movie deluxe Scorponok toy

     Stalker Scorponok here
is a repaint homage to
     <a href="scorponok.html">
      Beast Wars Scorponok
     </a>
     ,
in terms of his general color scheme of black, gray, and red. Ignoring
that homage detail for a minute, however, the color scheme itself is still
great-- I'm not fond of the particularly overdone shade of light milky
gray, but it's not the main color, and contrasts excellently with the other
colors. Scorponok actually has two different shades of black, the shade
used for his body being a bit lighter and more gray-ish than the black
used for his claws, helping give him a bit more color variety. The light
red paint apps are really striking, though, and definitely give him the
evil-touch (as if his look didn't say that enough already). The faded red
paint app on his stinger looks like it's human gore, something that I'm
surprised is on a kids' toy, even if they're just hinting at it. The bronze
and silver also go well with the black, though the bronze could've been
a shade or two brighter to stand out even more. Beyond just an awesome
color scheme, however, Stalker Scorponok has more Beast Wars homages than
just his color scheme. For one, the numbers "916-96" on his claws state
the original air date of the first Beast Wars episode (September 16th,
1996)! Also, one of the neat bronze "Cyberglyphs" tattooed on his main
body-- in particular, the large one on his right side-- is the shape of
half of the Predacon symbol (with a bit of wavy-ness added to make it look
more like a Cyberglyph). Ingenious.

     Stalker Scorponok is
a great repaint, and a great homage to Beast Wars Scorponok with some really
creative "easter eggs". It's as good as the mold is going to look... but
unfortunately, it IS this mold, and isn't that much of a
     <i>

     toy, even if he's got a great scorpion mode.

       Back on Cybertron, even before the war,
Scorponok lurked in the dark, unpopulated places of his world, waiting
for unsuspecting travelers to pass by. He would burrow silently through
the shifting powdered iron of the planet's southern deserts, stalking his
prey. The robots he hunted never even suspected his presence until he burst
from the ground in a shower of glittering, steel sand.
