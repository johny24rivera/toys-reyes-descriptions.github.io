    Long Haul's vehicle mode
is a dump truck, as it's pretty much always been. The color scheme is almost
entirely light green with some dark gray here and there-- normally this
would be a pretty boring color scheme, but there's several little bits
of paint detailing here and there that spice up the look of the vehicle
mode a little, such as the red headlights, silver headlights and windows,
and a dark gray "fade" near the bottom sides to look like some kind of
paint wear. It's still not exactly the most exciting color scheme, of course,
but these bits do help a bit. As for the mode design itself, when it comes
to its silouhette it's quite good-- it definitely looks like a dump truck
overall, maybe SLIGHTLY more "squat" than a real one, but that can be chalked
up to the whole younger age group Fast Action Battlers are aimed at. The
front part in particular is very well-done with a surprising amount of
mold detailing for a toy from this line, with little latters, grates, and
rails all molded into the front. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details,
and the closer you get to Long Haul's back end in this mode the worse it
gets. From the side you can see a definite hole in the overall structure
of this mode, and instead of an actual dump truck bed it's just his arms--
right there, in plain view, without any real attempt at hiding them. He
also doesn't have much of a back end at all-- it's just made of his upper
arms and the top of his head/chest piece from robot mode, unfortunately.

    Long Haul's robot mode
is definitely where the overall design's priority lies, in contrast to
most other Fast Action Battlers. Some of the front top of the vehicle mode
hangs behind his main body (though out of the way of MOST movement), but
other than that he's a pretty solid 'bot with pretty good proportions.
Making the legs out of the front part of the vehicle mode was a nice step,
and they make great legs proportionally, even if that part of the design
isn't movie-accurate. The arms are nice, beefy, and bulky, and really convey
the brute force a guy like Long Haul is supposed to have. Parts of the
rear of his vehicle mode are the same piece as his lower claw-hands, but
given his limited articulation here it's not that big of a deal-- plus,
it IS movie-accurate. I particular like Long Haul's head/chest sculpt--
it's REALLY well-done, with tons of details and paint apps. This guy looks
REALLY darned evil. My only caveat here is that his head is the same piece
as the rest of the chest, so unfortunately it can't move. Long Haul's articulation
is decent for a Fast Action Battler, though below-average for a mainline
toy-- he can move at the shoulders (at three points), the elbow at two
points on the left arm and one point on the right (it can only rotate at
the elbow on the latter), and he can also move at the hips, knees, and
waist. Long Haul's main gimmick from which he gets his prefix is that,
if you press down on the green button on his tire-shoulder on his right
arm, his right fist will slide forward slightly like an automatic "punch".
Honestly, it's a pretty weak gimmick though, especially consider it gives
him no real elbow movement on that arm. The faded bright orange paint app
on the lower gimmicked arm is a nice touch, though, since it makes it look
like his fist is in a "heated blurr" from a fast punch.

    Most of Devastation
Blast Long Haul's downsides come from his vehicle mode which, although
it has a nice silouhette, has lots of robot details poking out here and
there that hardly make it convicing. However, Long Haul's robot mode is
probably the best among the new round of Fast Action Battlers, with a real
stocky, brutish look to him and great proportions, albeit a weak gimmick.
Heck, in some ways-- most notably the arms and shoulders-- I feel he even
surpasses the mainline Voyager in robot mode. Still, overall I'd recommend
the mainline Voyager more if you can afford him or if you want something
a bit more complex. But if you don't/can't, this is a pretty darn good
substitute.

      Long Haul never talks, unless he's going
to complain about something. The other Decepticons expect him to carry
all their stuff, but he'd rather be fighting than transporting a bunch
of missiles and laser cannons. He likes to let other robots' gear bounce
out of his truck bed, and then tell them it got "lost" on the way.
