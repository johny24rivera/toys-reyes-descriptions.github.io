    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Overhaul. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Overhaul

     Warpath is a bit of a
G1 homage, but just in terms of color and allegiance-- the original Warpath
had a similar color combo, but without the light blue and a lot less black.
Other than that, though, Movie Warpath is completely different-- for one
thing, he's not a tank like G1 Warpath, he's a futuristic SUV. The light
electric blue "Allspark Power" paint apps REALLY look nice against the
dull red and black, which would make for a fairly dull color scheme by
themselves but with these accents just look great. I especially like the
stripes on the sides and front of Warpath's vehicle mode. The silver accents,
which are mostly visible in the alternate mode, also go great against the
black, too. There's no large place on Warpath that is completely one color
and bereft of paint apps, which is always good in my opinion. Oh, and using
transparent blue for the missile and light piping in the eyes to make Warpath
look more "Allspark Power-y" was a good decision, too. Honestly, I would've
preferred Warpath's charcoal black to be a more "pure" black, but other
than that I really don't have any complaints about his colors.

     No mold changes have
been made to Warpath, though he does come with a Speed Planet Cyber Key
this time around-- odd, why not just a generic Autobot key to fit in with
the Movie line better?

     Movie Warpath is a so-so
mold, but it has a GREAT paint job, plenty of paint apps, and is a fair
G1 homage as well. Recommended over this mold's previous paint jobs.

       Warpath isnt really into following
orders. The way he sees it, if Optimus Prime was all that into freedom,
hed let the other Autobots do what they wanted instead of trying to command
them all the time. For his part, Warpath is happy to fight the Decepticons,
because those guys are in serious need of a beat down. But hell do it
his own way, and on his own time.
