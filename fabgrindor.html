    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Gyro Blade Blackout. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Gyro Blade Blackout

     In an attempt to make
him a different character from Blackout-- despite the fact that they look
exactly the same in the movies-- every Grindor repaint of the Blackout
molds ends up a bit different. The Fast Action Battler is potentially the
most visually interesting. On this version, Grindor's main color is a bluish
off-white, making the toy a bit closer to the "Blackout's colors under
a bright sun" Grindor's scheme had in the daytime fight scene he had in
the movie. A dark, flat shade of blue serves as the main contrast color,
making him almost look like an inverse Blackout in vehicle mode, with the
gray serving as a tertiary color. Neither of these colors are particularly
exciting, but they go together fairly well, and Grindor has quite a lot
of paint apps-- his windows, vents, "crossed out" Autobot "kill signs"
on the sides of his cockpit, stripes, "NO STEP" signs... it's all there,
making him quite detailed in that respect for this line. In robot mode
however, he gains the visible addition of a pale light brown plastic and
some nice gold paint, which really goes well with any of his other colors
and gives him that extra snap to catch the eye-- good thing he's packaged
in this mode. His face is almost completely painted gold too, which looks
pretty awesome, even if it's completely inaccurate.

     Missile Assault Grindor
is a pretty good-- if not outstandingly awesome-- repaint of the FAB Blackout
mold, already an above-average toy for the line. If you don't want to pay
$20 for a repaint character, this is a decent backup.

       Grindor is always ready for a fight.
He plans everything out in detail, so that he knows exactly how a battle
is going to go before it even begins. He is always at the center of the
action so that he can use his heavy fire power to ensure his plans succeed.
