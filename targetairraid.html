    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Skyblast. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Skyblast

     Air Raid is the second
repaint of the Skyblast mold for the Target Exclusive scout class movie
line, and this time sports a very military-esque color scheme. The light
milky gray and black, by themselves, aren't particularly interesting of
a color scheme, but the jungle green makes all the difference and really
goes well with both colors while spicing things upaÂ  little-- particularly
with the black and muddy brown "blocky camoflauge" paint apps covering
the main body of Air Raid. I mean, really, they're ALL OVER the place--
if it wasn't for the light milky gray parts, it really would be rather
hard to pick out Air Raid among some foilage. I'm not as fond of the square
camoflauge as I am of the more traditional "curvy" camoflauge patterns,
however, more because of personal preference than anything else (not to
mention that real plants and foilage aren't shaped like boxes). The bits
of red look the best against the other colors, even though it's only used
in three tiny places (at the base of each wing and then on the robot optics).
It really adds some great contrast. Adding to the military feel is a painted
"S7" logo on the bottom of the chestpiece, which looks cool as always and
helps Air Raid to "blend in". There are a few paint apps Air Raid is missing
that he really needs, though-- namely, colored Autobot symbols on his wings
and camoflauge paint apps on the underside of his wings-- as it is, there's
only paint apps on the topside ofhis wings.

     Air Raid has a more
interesting-- and slightly more realistic-- color scheme than

     , but I still think he falls ever-so-slightly short of the
original color scheme used for this mold. If you can't find Energon Skyblast,
though, this is a nice substitute, as it's a great mold.

       Cybertron has laws, and the Decepticons
have broken almost all of them. It makes Air Raid sick just thinking about
it. Respect for the law is what separates sentient creatures from simple
drones. The Decepticons make a mockery of themselves and their fellow robots
by their disregard for the law. Not for much longer, though, if Air Raid
has anything to say about it. He's spent centuries hunting the worst Decepticon
criminals from one end of the galaxy to the other, and he's not stopping
until every last one is caught and punished.
