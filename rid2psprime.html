    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 warrior
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     The mass-release version
of warrior-class "Power Surge" Optimus Prime is a remold of the original
warrior class version, as opposed to the new-mold larger version. Because
of the scale and all, unfortunately he doesn't come with the Mini-Con Aerobolt
that powers him up. Unlike the show version where he gains a lot of white
coloration, here he's still mostly his traditional red and dark blue. The
dark blue coloration is pretty much the exact shade as on the original
version, while the red is just a TITCH lighter. Unfortunately that bland
light milky gray is still present on the toy, though thankfully it's still
a relatively minor color, only being used on the upper legs and parts of
the shoulders. The wheels, paint on the windows, and the axe are still
black; unfortunately because of the increased number of paint apps elsewhere,
the axe has no paint on this version. There's also some light electric
blue added to the color scheme, which looks pretty nice and adds a bit
more "pop". It's used on the main body, as well as his wing-swords. Speaking
of all the paint apps, there's soem nifty electric blue paint on circuitry-like
lines on his lower legs, lower arms, and on his robot eyes; silver on the
front of the truck grill, the faceplate, and on the feet; some white on
the ankles and on much of his lower chest/abs; and although it doesn't
look like it, the sides of the back portion of the truck trailer and the
top of the chest are painted red, as well.

     As for mold changes,
Power Surge Prime has a few. The most obvious ones are the large wings
on his back, which can rotate up-and-down in their pegs and also be taken
out and held in his hands; so Power Surge Optimus actually has more weapons
than he can hold! They're pretty awesome accessories/weapons, though they
don't really look like anything in vehicle mode and add another obvious
extra to that mode. (Overall, though, I think they're a positive.) The
main body section has also been changed both so that it can hold the sword-wings
on the back and to give him more accurate details on the robot chest, with
a bunch of great circuitry details on the abs and smaller "wings" on his
chest that mimic Aerobolt being plugged in there on the 'toon. He also
has twin cannon accessories that plug into the top of his chest in robot
mode and flank his head, and plug into the bottom of the vehicle mode--
more weaponry is always good if it can store in the alt mode! Interestingly
the shoulders and arms/truck cab have also been remolded even though it
wasn't really necessary, but I greatly appreciate it as they make the arms
MUCH better. The shoulders are now a bit larger, but this makes it so there's
less vehicle junk hanging off the lower arms. It's still not perfect, but
it definitely looks better than the previous try. The mold details on the
truck cab have also been changed a bit too, with rather intricate circular
exhaust port-like details on the top of the cab (which form the front of
the shoulders). Finally, the pieces that make the front sides of the trailer/parts
of the lower robot legs have also been remolded, with more stripes and
a few more intricate details on the sides-- though the middle two tires
have been removed from the toy on each side, meaning Optimus Prime actually
doesn't have enough wheels anymore-- just six overall, and just two on
his cab. So that's kinda odd.

     Power Surge Optimus
Prime is a decent remold of the warrior class version, with some excellent
added details and weaponry. The improved arms are also a very appreciated
touch as well, and in robot mode he looks really nice; however, in vehicle
mode he has even MORE extras from his robot mode now, so it's a slightly
worse alt mode than the original RID2015 warrior. Still, overall I think
the mold has been improved and is more interesting than the original, though
if you're going to get one version of this remold get the Toys "R" Us exclusive
version, which has a more show-accurate paint job.
