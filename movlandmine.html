    Landmine's vehicle mode
is a Sector 7 military buggy, and is incredibly accurate to the Sector
7 buggies that showed up in the movie, right down to the gas tanks in the
rear of the vehicle. The amount of detail, where appropriate, really is
incredible on Landmine-- little "rivets" on all the metal plates, heavy-duty
tires, a roof-mounted grenade launcher (which can move at three seperate
places)-- the works. There's even small seats inside, made from the robot
mode hands, and his front tires have spring suspension! Unfortunately,
little of it is actually brought out by Landmine's paint apps. For some
reason Hasbro decided the paint budget would be better spend on FIVE different
S7 emblems on the vehicle mode-- along with a few other emblems-- instead
of just highlighting the details that were actually molded into the figure,
which is a bit of a shame. At least Landmine's headlights and tailights
are painted, otherwise he'd look almost prototypish due to his lack of
paint in this mode. There's no robot extras to speak of in this mode, except
for a few telltale hinges here and there.

    Landmine's robot mode
is, for the most part, very cool-looking, and certainly very unique. He's
got pretty humanoid proportions, but he has interesting claw-hands made
out of the seats of his vehicle mode (which, honestly, look rather weird),
and the wheels on the heels of his feet, combined with the mask over his
four-eyed face, make him look like some kind of Transformer hockey player,
and really adds some character to him. Using the gas cans as feet was also
a stroke of genius, as well. All of the vehicle parts stay tucked away
behind his back or on the outsides of his arms, and he has great articulation--
he can move at the neck, waist, hips (at two points), knees, shoulders
(at two points), elbows, wrists, and at the base and midpoint of each finger-claw.
So you can get a lot of cool poses out of him. Oh, and he's got some nice
weaponry, as that grenade launcher from his vehicle mode becomes a hand-held
weapon in this mode. Sometimes his tire-heels can become unpegged rather
easily, which obviously messes with Landmine's stability some. Landmine
is also one of the few Allspark Power toys where I really don't think the
usage of Allspark "electric blue" is appropriate-- Landmine's color scheme
is very dull yet realistic, and then all of a sudden BAM! light electric
blue on a military vehicle. It just looks off, especially on the robot
face, and clashes with the rest of the color scheme.

    Landmine is one of the
best deluxe molds from the movie line, with a simple transformation yet
a solid (if rather unpainted) alternate mode with great mold detailing
and a very unique, "hockey-player-esque" robot mode. Some parts of his
transformation are just plain ingenious, too, like the hands forming the
vehicle seats and the gas cans forming the robot mode feet. Highly recommended.

      Brought to life by the AllSpark pulsewave
released during the final battle against Megatron, Landmine is still learning
what it means to be an Autobot. He is content, however, to continue his
work with the humans of Sector 7, even while Ironhide trains him in the
finer points of robot combat. He enjoys the excitement and intrigue of
working as an agent in a super-secret organization. Knowing that what he
does not only keeps the humans safe, but also protects his fellow Autobots
brings him great gratification.
