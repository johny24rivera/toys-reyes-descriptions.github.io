    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Bumper Battler
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Bumper Battler Optimus Prime

     Nightwatch Optimus Prime
looks like he'd be at home in some sort of big city underground racing
circuit. The black and midnight blue color scheme is right at home with
the neon green windows and and red details if you come at it from that
point of view and not solely from a realistic direction. (After all, it's
Animated, you're in the wrong TF line if you're looking for realistic-styled
toys.) The color scheme may not seem like it's good from just listing off
the various colors, but just the right amount of the colors are used pretty
much across the board, and it all comes across really well, particularly
in vehicle mode. I particularly like how the green and midnight blue look
together, they contrast EXTREMELY well. The red is also a nice contrast
color, especially against the black, and Nightwatch Prime also has several
accent colors-- often used in only one or two places-- that also help add
plenty of nice detailing to the toy, such as the light blue on his axe
and bright orange headlights. I also find it interesting that Prime has
a symbol on the right side of both the front bumper of his vehicle mode
and on his right shoulder in robot mode that both look like sort of Autobot
police symbol-- has he switched duties for this form? Just about the only
thing I'm not fond of when it comes to the color scheme is that there's
large swaths of unpainted light milky gray visible in robot mode, which
doesn't look too hot and detracts a bit from the otherwise "dark" color
scheme of Nightwatch Prime.

     No mold changes have
been made to Nightwatch Optimus Prime-- however, some of his sound effects
are new. After several presses of his sound effect buttons, this is a list
of what I've got:

     Nightwatch Optimus Prime
is a great repaint-- one that I'd definitely like to see on a mainline
toy, even if it didn't make it into the show. I really like the "street
racing" vibe it has to it, and the new sounds make it feel more different
than "just another repaint". Recommended over the original Bumper Battler
Optimus Prime.

       If he has to fight, Optimus Prime prefers
to do it out in the open, and to keep it fair. He's wise enough to know
that the Decepticons don't feel the same way, so he uses his special night
mode that lets him sneak up on the bad guys without being seen.
