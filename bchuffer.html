    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Armorhide. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Armorhide

     Huffer is definitely
an homage to his G1 self in terms of color scheme and general appearance.
His truck mode has almost the exact same shade of orange that his original
G1 toy had, and it blends in with the dark blue and black quite well. Of
course, several secondary colors were added to make this toy more visually
interesting than the tiny G1 minibot, including light blue and green. There's
less silver than on the G1 toy, but it's used appropriately-- if it was
used too much, it might clash with the other colors and end up making the
toy look too "light". The "CYBERTRONIAN WRECKER SERVICE" decals on the
sides are also nice touches. All in all, the colors go together quite well,
but I haven't exactly seen bright orange-and-blue trucks running up and
down the highways, which makes it rather a pretty unrealistic scheme.

     No mold changes have
been made to Huffer-- and why, really, when Armorhide's head already looks
so much like Huffer's?

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Huffer is a pretty well
thought-out homage of a G1 character on a mold that already looked a lot
like him, but because of how unfitting his colors are for a truck, it's
my least favorite iteration of this mold color-wise. I recommend you get
either Armorhide iteration instead, given their better colors and much
cheaper price, unless you're a big Huffer fan.

       When Huffer finally returned home to
Cybertron, most Autobots figured he would never again venture any further
than the construction mines of Iacon. When it was revealed that he had
agreed to join the crew of the Graviton, nobody was more surprised, or
impressed, than Optimus Prime. Maybe it was because there was little work
to do on his newly rebuilt homeworld, or maybe he had become accustomed
to having what he built destroyed. Regardless, he had decided to leave
Cybertron again and to use his skills in a new venture.
