    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium War Within Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium War
Within Optimus Prime

     As is quickly becoming
a trend (albeit one I don't particularly mind), War Within Optimus Prime
has been repainted into Ultra Magnus. Granted, War Within Ultra Magnus
in the comics looked much more like the traditional
     <a href="titang1magnus.html">
      G1
Magnus
     </a>
     and not a white Prime repaint, but eh, it still looks nice.
The white certainly differentiates him from Prime's darker colors, and
the blue looks superb next to the white. Unlike on many other versions
of Ultra Magnus, the blue isn't a particularly light color, so it provides
some great contrast-- there's also more of it in comparison to the white
than on other white Prime-Magnuses as well, which I think looks better.
The bits of red and yellow used mostly on parts of the robot mode also
provide some great contrast against the blue and are just good secondary
colors all-around. The silver doesn't provide very good contrast agains
the white, as both are light colors (which is why I would've preferred
a blue faceplate, not a silver one), but it does go well against the blue.

     No mold changes have
been made to War Within Ultra Magnus, so unfortunately, his joints are
just as loose as War Within Optimus Prime's, maybe even a little moreso.
That's Magnus' biggest flaw, right there.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     War Within Ultra Magnus
is an excellent repaint with some very nice color choices, especially for
the accent colors. He's not QUITE as good as War Within Prime in terms
of color schemes, but he's pretty darned close-- not to mention he doesn't
have the paint chipping problem on the legs like Prime does. His floppy
joints are his only particularly annoying flaw.

       No commander could ask for a finer soldier
than Ultra Magnus. He is a total soldier - highly intelligent and deadly
dangerous, but with a fervent desire for peace and a willingness to sacrifice
himself for the sake of a cause or his fellow Autobots.

       The death of Sentinel Prime sent him
into a tailspin. Certainly the Autobots hadn't been winning the war, but
the pace of their losses had slowed. The hope of a rally was just over
the horizon when Megatron pulled the Autobot leader's spark core from his
ruined body. To hear that Optronix had been passed the mantle of leadership
- made Optimus Prime - was simply another, greater shock. The archivist?

       Ultra Magnus is on the other side of
Cybertron, literally a world away from his new leader. As the Decepticons
continue slaughtering their way around the globe, he and his men wait for
word from Optimus Prime, hoping that the new leader proves equal to the
challenge of the diabolical will to conquest of Megatron.
