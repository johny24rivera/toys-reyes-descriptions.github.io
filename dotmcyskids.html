    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Skids. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
RotF Legends class Skids

     Skids has followed Bumblebee's
lead in getting a "stealth"-style paint job simply by flipping his main
colors around. He's still green and black-- just much more black than green.
It's a better look for him, particularly in vehicle mode where the light
green stripes look REALLY nice against all that black. There's also a good
amount of that green on his legs in robot mode, but his robot arms are
left unpainted, which can make the details a little hard to make out there
since it's just solid black plastic. His windows are also unpainted, but
given their base plastic color it's not as big of a deal here as it normally
would be. Skids also has a bit of silver for his headlights and taillights,
and his robot eyes are a really nice shade of aquamarine. Both are good
colors that contrast well against the others, but there isn't enough of
them to really make much of an overall contribution to his general scheme.

     You wouldn't think that
this version of Skids has any mold changes from its previous versions,
but it actually does-- his normal-sized hand has been slightly retooled
to fit the standard Cyberverse handles for weapons and vehicles.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     DotM Legion Skids is
the best deco the mold has gotten-- the light green against the black looks
sharp, and was a good color choice while still keeping the character's
"standard" colors. Still, this IS the
     <i>
      Revenge of the Fallen
     </i>
     Legends/Legion
class Skids mold, which means it's not particularly anything to write home
about.

       Autobot Skids has grown up a lot since
the battle against The Fallen. He's learned a little bit about keeping
his mouth shut, and more about how to handle himself in a fight. Ironhide
has spent months training him into an effective fighter. Now he's ready
to get back on the battlefield.
