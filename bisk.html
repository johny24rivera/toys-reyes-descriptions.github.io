    Bisk's alternate mode
is a sportscar, but it's appropriately kinda lobster-y. The front side
sections look like claws (and indeed, are the top of his robot mode claws),
he has two spoiler "prongs" that remind one of the tail of a lobster, and
the whole mode is generally very curvy and streamlined. The cockpit's quite
low, with a long front hood-- in general, it looks like a very sleek, very
unique car, with great proportions. In fact, even by RID2015 standards,
he's fairly sparsely detailed in this mode, with some basic window details,
a few lines and minor panels here and there-- really the only part of this
mode that has a fair amount of mold detailing is the front end, with some
headlight details near the sides and a few angular grill patterns on the
front. For extras in this mode, there's basically none, though Bisk doesn't
have much of a back end-- it's just his knees and then the tires next to
them, so no molded-in taillights or anything of the sort, unfortunately.
Still, otherwise he's incredibly solid. For colors, in this mode Bisk is
mostly a milky orange, which of course is PERFECT for a lobster-car. He's
got a fair amount of black as well-- on the windows (including the rear
window, huzzah!), the wheels, and on the center area of his grill. The
front-side headlights are blue with some silver paint around them, and
that same blue paint is on the rims of the wheels, giving them a futuristic
"TRON-esque" look. Finally, there's a dark dull milky red paint used on
vents on the front grill and on the spoiler prongs. It's a fairly nice,
fairly unique shade that not only fits a lobster, but also contrasts and
complements against the main orange color. Bisk has two single-barrel,
single-piece gun weapons, which can stick into ports on the sides of his
front hood in this mode.

    To transform Bisk to
his robot mode, his legs unfold from the back end of the car, his lobster
claws are made from the front/sides of the car, and the front hood splits
and folds down to become his shoulders. Meanwhile, you open up his chest
and fold out the robot head before closing it again. The end result is
an incredibly unique humanoid lobster-robot mode. Proportionally, Bisk
has overly long arms and overly short legs, but this is show-accurate.
Plus, with those huge clackin' claws making up so much of his car mode
(and they ARE that big in the show-- heck, maybe even a bit bigger), the
arms kinda have to be long. I just love his claws-- the wheels in the middle
of them, and the headlight details on the front of each. They're brilliant.
Plus, he can still hold his guns on the top of each (though he doesn't
really have any other place for them, unfortunately). The car hood halves
on his shoulders help frame and bulk up said shoulders a bit, and don't
really get in the way of articulation, so I rather like them. The legs
have wheels sticking off the sides of the lower legs, but this is rather
minor-- the legs still look great, complete with the dark red and black
details from the back end of the car mode looking nice on the lower legs,
and with two-toed, crustacean-esque feet. His chest unfortunately is rather
nondescript, having the typical RID2015 faux black window stripe across
the center and otherwise a bit unremarkable. His body narrows quite a bit
at the abs, which makes the roof of his car mode stick out a bit from the
sides in what I would call the only actual bits of unsightly kibble in
this mode. Bisk's headsculpt you'll either love or hate-- I LOVE it, given
how unique the rest of him is. It's made of that bendy plastic, with long
antennae, blue eyes on stalks, a simple silver mouth and "nose", and silver
bits on the end of his chin-antennae that look like a long divided beard.
He's also got a small "lobster tail" detail hanging out slightly below
his waist-- another nice touch. The dark red is much more apparent in this
mode, making up his upper legs, feet, and upper arms, and helps break up
the colors a bit, along with the aforementioned paint on his head and chest,
as well as some more black paint on his waist. Combined with the vehicle
paint apps, he's quite varied in this mode, while still having a cohesive,
nice color scheme overall. For articulation, Bisk can move at the neck,
shoulders (at three points), elbows (at two points), at the base of each
lower claw, and at the hips (at two points), knees, and slightly back-and-forth
at the ankles. Other than waist rotation, he's got pretty much all the
articulation you could reasonably ask for in this mode, so he's quite poseable.

    Bisk was one of the
many RID2015 Decepticon designs I wanted a toy of IMMEDIATELY upon seeing
him on-screen, and thankfully he's one of the few to get a Warrior-class
toy. Other the back of his hood sticking out slightly from behind his main
body, he's got no real downsides, and just looks incredibly unique and
characterful, and is solid in both modes. My favorite mold of the entire
RID2015 line (though if you're only going to get one version, I think the
Thermidor remold is slightly better.)
