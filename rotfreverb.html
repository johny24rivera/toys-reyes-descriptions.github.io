    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Knock
Out. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the
Fallen Knock Out

     Reverb is kind of an
interesting repaint. Even though he's a motorcycle through and through,
he's a repaint homage to--get this--
     <a href="inferno.html">
      Beast Wars
Inferno
     </a>
     . Yup, as you can see, the color scheme is pretty close Inferno's
with light red and a duller red being the main colors, with some gray and
black as well. There's some new touches to his color scheme, though, including
a very nice-looking blue-and-white stripe deco going down his top and sides,
which adds some very nice contrast and really makes him almost twice as
eye-catching, if you ask me. Still, what cements him as an Inferno homage
and not just a toy that happens to have similar colors are a few nice nods
on the paint scheme. For one, his robot mode head-- which is already insect-like
and kind of like Inferno's in the first place-- is painted exactly like
the Beast Wars character's, with a gray face and black "antennae". Also,
although it's a bit hard to make out due to the fancy lettering, on the
sides of his vehicle mode he's got the words "Colony Racing". Yup, that's
Inferno, alright. Ingenious.

     RotF Reverb is pretty
much a must-get for fans of Beast Wars Inferno, given he hasn't gotten
an homage since, y'know... the original toy. But as a color scheme, although
it's certainly not bad, I don't think it's as eye-catching with as much
stunning contrast as this mold's first release as Knock Out.

       Reverb loves being a Decepticon. Since
the war began, he's got to travel from one end of the galaxy to the other,
meet hundreds of interesting beings, and help to annihilate them. All that
violence has been nonstop fun, as far as he is concerned. The other Decepticons
seem to enjoy being gloomy, but that doesn't bother Reverb. He's not going
to let them ruin his fun.
