    I have the distinct feeling
that the briefly-seen (CGI) helicopter mode Drift had in the movie was
not at all planned initially by Hasbro, given how it's never directly referred
to in the movie and none of his toys even attempt a triple-changing aspect--
so instead, we get 2 toys for Drift in some categories, like 1-step changers!
For his helicopter-alt-mode version, Drift looks rather futuristic in his
alt mode-- not like any helicopter I've seen in real life. The very angular
and complex cockpit shape, the side missiles, the multiple "layered armor"
bits across the toy-- it all generally looks cool, even despite some proportional
maladies. The nosecone is a bit fatter than I'd think, as is the rear main
body of the helicopter, and the side wings and tailfin are a bit smaller
than you'd expect. All that said, they don't bother me as much as they
would have if Drift had been trying to copy some real helicopter-- the
"futuristic" look gives him a bit more leeway here, and he still most definitely
looks like a helicopter. The only outright robot mode extras I'd say exist
in this mode are the bottom of the robot feet on the bottom of the back
half or so-- they're a bit too obvious, whereas even the robot arms-- fairly
obviously sticking out of the sides once you know the transformation--
blend in with their surroundings pretty darned well. As mentioned before,
the layered "armor" detailing looks very nice, and is everywhere on the
figure, along with some mold details that look like they're car parts,
including a couple of round unpainted "wheel" parts, some car intake vents
on the sides, and even the Bugatti front on the top of the cockpit! He's
also got plenty of molded-in firepower, like missile packs below his wings
and a gun below the front nosecone. The rotors can spin quite freely as
well, so no problems there. The color scheme is very much your typical
AoE Drift scheme, with a rather nice dark semi-metallic blue making up
the main plastic color, with a bit of light metallic blue paint on the
"armored bits" like the sides of this mode. Top if all off with some silver
paint on the cockpit, some black paint on the faux Bugatti grill, and some
(admittedly rather dull) brownish gray plastic on the rotors, missiles,
and a few other minor parts, and you've got a pretty snazzy-looking helicopter
mode, overall.

    To transform Drift to
robot mode, you simply press in on the faux Bugatti grill on the top, and
the whole thing folds in on itself automatically for the robot mode. I'm
surprised Hasbro went with as many differences to the robot mode are there
are-- there's still part of the faux Bugatti front on his chest, and the
armored light metallic blue bits on his upper arms and upper legs, but
his lower legs have larger toes and large missile racks hanging off of
them, while the lower arms have the missiles (now wrist-blades, which can
slide forward!) hanging off them. The helicopter cockpit is also clearly
visible on the lower chest, making this version of Drift a bit leaner and
lankier than his car mode toys, and the blades on his back are collapsed
into two long blades from his helicopter mode-- definitely not what his
blades are arrayed like on his car toys, though this last part is certainly
understandable given the limitations of 1-step changers. From a side view,
clear "dividing lines" can be seen in the middle of Drift's legs, and I'm
not fond of the little tailfin sticking out of his butt, but otherwise
extra-wise he looks pretty good in this mode. The detailing on Drift's
face is as good as ever, and-- unlike many of his other toys-- he actually
has the accurate gold face, always a good thing. (Given how many parts
are visible in both parts, Drift has the same general color and mold detailing
layout in this mode as in vehicle mode.) For articulation, Drift can only
move at the shoulders (at two points), and his wrist-blades can slide back-and-forth--
though articulation isn't the point of 1-step changers, of course.

    AoE 1-step changer helicopter
Drift is one of the few 1-step changers I'd mildly recommend even to people
who don't collect toys from the subline to pick up. Sure, he's got very
limited articulation and a few minor unsightly bits in robot mode, but
in general he looks pretty solid in both modes, has great coloration and
detail, and is a mold created very specifically for the futuristic sort
of helicopter Drift changes into briefly in the movie, unlike his voyager
toy, which is a remold of an older toy. It's also different enough from
the

    to be worth
a purchase even if you have the latter. He's not perfect, but he's one
of my favorite 1-step changers from the AoE line.
