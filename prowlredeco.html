    Mold History
   </b>
   : Prowl was a completely
new mold created for Car Robots (which subsequently became Robots in Disguise).

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original deluxe RiD
Prowl. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
deluxe RiD Prowl

     Out of the three Car
Brothers redecos, Prowl is the one whose color scheme has changed the least.
He still retains the same basic color scheme of dark blue and white- however,
there's much more dark blue on him this time around, and gold has been
added as well. This makes his mode look quite a bit nicer, even though
it's still the same color scheme overall. His gold tires and his gold-traced
shoulder pads in robot mode look very nice indeed, as well as his transmetal
gold Autobot symbol on his chest. In his vehicle mode, the Japanese lettering
has been replaced by English this time around- the word "Police" graces
his hood and side doors. His Japanese name, "Mach Alert", is also on his
side doors as well.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     No mold changes have
been made to this toy since its last release, so Prowl retains all the
features and flaws of his predecessor in that area.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     It's amazing how much
"Super" Prowl's look is improved upon from the original, while still using
the same basic color scheme. Recommended over the original.

         This time around, Prowl
gets a color scheme consisting of a dominating blue in color, with white
as a secondary color and chrome gold bits to add a bit of RID flare. In
my opinion, this is the best version of the RID Prowls we have gotten (Original
deluxe, this one, and
         <a href="prowl2.html">
          Spychanger
         </a>
         ). The blue is
much more interesting and pleasing to the eyes, and is a bit more appropriate
for Prowl here. The only color from the original Prowl that isn't seen
here is the chrome red on the chest in robot mode, now replaced with chrome
gold. The chrome silver tires are chrome gold now as well.

         Althought the mold has no mold changes,
it does have a slight deco change, he has POLICE: Mach Alert on the sides
of the car and "Police" across the hood. I liked the Japenese writing better,
but in no way am I counting the paint change against the mold. Better to
keep the molds unique.

        <font face="OCR A Extended">
         On a final note, the doors are on very
weak ball sockets on this guy it seems, both of mine snapped.
        </font>
        <br/>
        <font face="OCR A Extended">
         Mildly recommended,
as it is a decent mold and better than the original prowl.

            Prowl cruises the streets searching
for enemy activity. His ultra-sensitive radars can detect the hum of a
circuit from the other side of town. And once he locates them, they had
better start running before he takes aim with his advanced weaponry. He
can sabotage Decepticon plots with his electronic systems for jamming radios
or hacking into systems.
