    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Crosswise. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Crosswise

     Unlike the other "Mirror
Universe" Autobots, Jazz looks like, well... "normal" Jazz. Granted, I'm
sure because this mold was never done as anything resembling Jazz before,
so it's completely different color-wise from any other use of the Cybertron
Crosswise mold, but still... it seems a bit of a waste to make "evil" Jazz
look almost exactly the same color-wise as the normal good Jazz. That's
not to say it's not a good color scheme, though-- white and black have
always been excellent colors, and there's a bit more blue detailing on
Jazz than I'm used to, which helps to spice up the color scheme a bit.
The white painted on his clear tinted parts is noticeably lighter than
the milky white plastic used for his other white parts, though, which is
a bit disconcerting in car mode. He's also got the usual red/white/blue
stripes in vehicle mode, and the "4" on his doors and front of his car
mode. There are some minor changes to our typical lovable Jazz, though,
and that comes down to his logos-- instead of "Meister Racing", it's "Massacre
Racing". He's also got "Kill to Win" logos above his front wheels, and
black lines have been painted above his front headlights to make it look
like the headlights are eyes and the black lines are "eyebrows", so he's
"glaring" at you as he charges forward. These are really nice touches,
and so incredibly corny that they loop right back around to being really
awesome.

     Jazz has gotten a head
remold, so that the head actually looks like Jazz in robot mode. It's a
pretty spot-on representation of Jazz, with all the details and proportions
right-on. His expression looks rather neutral, though-- I would have liked
an "angry" or "mischevious grin" look molded onto his face to make it more
obvious he's a bad guy. Jazz also has had the mold's Cyber Key changed,
to a "normal Autobot" Cyber Key instead.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon Jazz has a decent
color scheme, plenty of paint apps, a good head remold, and some really
nice changes to his logos in car mode. However, there's just not enough
about him to really classify him as "Mirror Universe" Jazz beyond said
logos, which I think is his greatest flaw. He just looks a bit out-of-place
with the other darker-colored Mirror Universe Autobots.

       Autobot Jazz and his brother Ricochet
serve as Optimus Prime's powerful and merciless bodyguards. While the Seeker
unit is designed to hunt down and destroy targets, Jazz and Ricochet stay
with Optimus Prime to protect him against any and all threats. Jazz is
one of Optimus Prime's most loyal and trusted aides. He only wishes to
serve the glorious future that Optimus laid out for the Autobots and he
is completely convinced of his cause. Recently, Jazz intercepted a series
of transmissions from a planet called Earth. While garbled, he managed
to decode and translate enough to become enamored with the planet's culture.
As a result, he gave himself a new design pattern with his own special
modifications. Everything he does has to be with style, from talking to
simply transforming. While Optimus Prime finds this behavior strange, he
allows Jazz some latitude from standard Autobot military practice as long
as he remains loyal to him.
