    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Animated voyager Optimus
Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Animated voyager
Optimus Prime

     Toxitron has a rather
interesting history-- originally planned as a redeco of G2 "Laser Rod"
Optimus Prime, the famously horrendously-colored redeco was cancelled.
The idea was loved, though, and here it's revived, with Toxitron being
the Bizarro to Animated Optimus' Superman. The color scheme is obviously
not for everyone, but it fits an Animated character especially well-- the
purple, black, and dull purplish gray serve as nice "Decepticon-y" base
colors, with the yellow having a distinctly toxic shade to it and contrasting
well with other main colors (and this coming from someone who normally
doesn't like yellow as a main color). The transparent red plastic used
for the sirens and windows is also a great shade, and contrasts fantastically
against the yellow (same with the red paint, to boot). The light orange
"toxic drips" around Toxitron's gun nozzle, left shoulder, and on the sides
of his vehicle mode are well done, though against the yellow it's light
enough where it's hard to see. To top it all off, Toxitron's face is a
horrendously sick-looking color of green, which just goes great with the
rest of his theme.

     Toxitron is definitely
for a rather specific audience (hence why he's a Botcon exclusive)-- if
you like Animated, liked Toxitron's so-bad-it's-good color scheme, and
"themed" redecos like this one, than this one is definitely for you. If
you like your Transformers more realistic and subdued, though, this is
one to avoid at all costs. (Compared with Motormaster, I think this one's
colors are SLIGHTLY worse, but it's still surprisingly good-looking given
the colors that it works with, with care obviously put into the details.)

       Toxitron was the first attempt by Doctor
Scalpel and Oil Slick to protoform a warrior in an Autobot shell. The failed
experiment produced a bizarre duplicate of Optimus Prime with immense strength,
corrosive toxic sludge cannons, a hopelessly stunted intellect, and a penchant
for driving backwards in vehicle mode. Fortunately for the Decepticons,
the data from this mishap led to greater success with Projects Stunticon
and Nemesis Prime.
