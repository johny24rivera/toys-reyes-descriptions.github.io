    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations FoC Starscream

     from this mold,
there's no way we weren't getting a Skywarp as well. Anyways, this redeco
of Starscream-- for the most part-- fits into the typical "Skywarp color
palette" deco, with black and a rather nice of purple being two of his
main colors. The purple is just a tad darker than usual, but I think this
is a good thing in light of the big change-up for this version of Skywarp--
an addition of quite a lot of gray, particuarly in his jet mode. Thankfully
it's not that awful milky light gray, it's a rather flat shade of the color--
however, it still doesn't look nearly as good as it would have had there
been mostly black plastic in its place. This goes doubly so for the couple
of accent colors, such as his orange cockpit and light pinkish-purple paint
used on some parts for "Energon conduit detailing", the latter of which
is a vital part of the Fall of Cybertron aesthetic. These colors largely
are surrounded by gray plastic, when they would have contrasted a LOT better
against black plastic. The short stripes on Skywarp's wings are also gray
instead of gray AND purple-- another missed opportunity, in my opinion.

Skywarp still has the best color scheme out of the trio of FoC Seekers,
in my opinion, but it's not nearly as good as it could be, due to the overabundance
of gray (particularly in jet mode), which doesn't provide nearly as much
contrast. More black and less gray (or a more metallic shade of the latter)
really would've helped this version truly shine, if you ask me. Still,
mildly recommended.

       Skywarp could use his teleportation
ability to tip any battle in favor of the Decepticons. Too bad his circuits
aren't sharp enough to figure out when and where he should use it. Instead
of creating an unrivaled tactical advantage, it mostly gets used for harmless
pranks. Betcha didn't see that coming.
