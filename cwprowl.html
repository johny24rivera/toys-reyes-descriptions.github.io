    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Dead End.

     It's pretty much inevitable--
if there's a police car design released in a TF line, it's more than likely
to get redecoed into Prowl somewhere down the line, and that's exactly
what
     <a href="cwstreetwise.html">
      Streetwise
     </a>
     has been redecoed into.
The thing is, both Streetwise AND Prowl are primarily white, which rather
limits how different one can be from the other. That said, Hasbro certainly
did a good job regardless, making sure an ample amount of black is visible
on Prowl, particularly in robot mode. The white is also more of a "pure"
shade, compared to Streetwise's milky off-white, so there's that as well.
The signature Prowl two-edged "swoop" paint app on the front of his hood
that comes to a head in the middle is here, and he also has his usual "HIGHWAY
PATROL POLICE" text on the side car doors, along with a blue police badge
on said doors. (All of this is a bit cramped, though, given that due to
the mold breakup, there's a stripe of unpaintable black plastic going up
about two-thirds back on each "car door" piece.) The light silvery blue
paint on his windows also looks great, contrasts well against the white,
and helps differentiate him from Streetwise a bit more. (And hey, even
the rear window is painted-- a rarity on a mass-release toy in this day
and age.) Like the other Optimus Maximus deluxe components, Prowl's hand/foot/gun
weapon is mostly a rather medium gray-- a bit bland, but thankfully used
fairly sparingly, only used elsewhere on Prowl's waist and combiner connector
piece. The outside of the weapon is mostly painted silver, though it's
odd that Prowl's shotgun weapon is left white-- silver is a MUCH more fitting
color for said weapon. The rear section of Prowl's vehicle mode is also
rather bereft of paint, with no paint on the taillights or rear bumper
at all. In robot mode, Prowl is considerably less accurate to G1 when it
comes his overall structure compared to his vehicle mode, so most of his
color scheme is simply a side effect of the colors from his vehicle mode.
That said, his upper legs are appropriately black, and his faux hood-chest
does have a miniaturized angular black paint app on it that fairly closely
mirrors his vehicle hood paint app. His lower legs are also painted the
same silvery blue that his car windows are-- homaging that his
     <a href="g1prowl.html">
      G1
toy
     </a>
     had the vehicle's rear windows for its lower legs. I wish there
were a few "minor detail" paint apps on Prowl's robot mode, but otherwise
his color scheme is better "spread-out" than in vehicle mode.

     Prowl has the same mold
changes made to the Dead End design that Streetwise does, along with a
new headsculpt. The headsculpt is pretty much a straight-up re-do of his
classic G1 design with less boxy proportions, and looks nice with the silver
face and red headcrests that mirror the red on his police sirens. (The
black eyes are a tad creepy, though.) The only complaint I have about the
headsculpt is that the lips are over-pronounced the point where it looks
like he had injections done-- weird.

     Combiner Wars Prowl
may not be the most G1-accurate update in robot mode, but he's got a solid
color scheme, excellent proportions in both modes, and is another use of
one of the best molds of the entire line. Honestly, unless you're a stickler
for G1 accuracy in nearly every respect, I'd go for this over the

        Prowl possesses the most complex and
comprehensive analytical mind on record-- he has the ability to simultaneously
track the current position of over 8 million objects in motion, as well
as predict their future locations with stunning accuracy. His logic processors
make his counsel indispensible to Autobot High Command. (Now if he could
just get the troops to follow his thorough plans more carefully...). Prowl
has been devising ways to finish this war for millions of years, only to
see the passion and courage of the Autobots trump his results-based planning
time and again. It's enough to make a bot flip a table over now and then.
His dual missile launchers aren't half as dangerous as the acid core rounds
he fires from his blaster.

         Prowl first earned his reputation for
thorough analysis working for the Mechaforensics Division on the Iaconian
Police Force. He spent many years on Earth later in his career, finding
the moral grayness of the planet troublesome, as Prowl is a bot whose optics
view the universe in black and white. Forms either an arm or leg of Optimus
Maximus, the combined form of Optimus Prime.
