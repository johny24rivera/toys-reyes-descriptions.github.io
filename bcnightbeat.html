    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Hot Shot. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Hot Shot

     Another fan-favorite
character gets redone from an existing mold, and this time it's the daring
Autobot detective Nightbeat! Energon Hot Shot's vehicle mode was already
heavily reminiscent of Nightbeat's G1 vehicle mode, so redecoing it up
in Nightbeat's colors wasn't much of a stretch. The colors in general are
a nice match- the light blue and yellow work together well, though I think
using a bit less of an orangey-yellow would have looked a bit better, it's
a tad loud compared to the other colors. I'm also not too fond of his gun
being made of clear plastic, though I guess if they had to make the car
windows normal clear plastic this was unavoidable. The black serves as
a very nice contrast, however, and Nightbeat was certainly spared no expense
when it came to the paint applications-- he's got lots of 'em. The flames
on his doors look cool, but he's also got a lot of minute details on his
chest and lower legs-- including even a bunch of nifty black lines on the
tops of said lower legs-- that really give him a lot of variety.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nightbeat also has a
mold change-- a new head! Unfortunately... it doesn't look like it should.
It SHOULD have been a spot-on representation of G1 Nightbeat's head...
but the final product has the large antennae on the sides of his head--
his head's defining characteristic-- completely removed from his body.
Apparently, they didn't meet "clearance issues" for the transformation,
and someone at the factory in China chopped the antennae off of the mold
and didn't tell the TF Club guys until it was too late. A real shame, and
I'd be lying if I didn't say it subtracted from the look of the toy a bit,
but you can hardly blame Fun Publications for this.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Overall, if you're a
fan of Nightbeat, and the removed antennae doesn't bother that much, than
this is a must-buy, and it comes with a cool detective comic story. But
otherwise, given the prices of Club exclusives, your money is probably
better spent elsewhere, as this isn't exactly the best mold in recent years.

       When Grimlock approached Nightbeat about
joining his crew in the search for Bludgeon and the rest of the Decepticons
who had fled Klo, he naturally jumped at the opportunity. It was a mystery
to solve, and Nightbeat was ready for the challenge. Along with Muzzle
and their trusted (and rather loud) comrade Siren, the three headed off
with Grimlock and the rest of the crew aboard the Graviton.

       Now, after deciding that even the remnants
of war was just something he no longer wanted to be a part of, Nightbeat
finds himself commanding a crew of his own: one made of comrades, new and
old, together mapping out different star systems to explore and finding
new mysteries to solve!
