    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Autobot Alliance
Activator Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Like most redecos of
Optimus Prime these days, Rally Rumble Optimus Prime is more a repositioning
of his primary colors (no pun intended) and changing their shades a bit
as opposed to a totally new deco job. The main plastic color changes are
that both the blue and red have been made a bit paler (and more glittery-looking)
compared to the original Autobot Alliance Activator version of the character.
Personally, I think that this aesthetic choice doesn't really look any
better or worse than the initial version, it's just... different. I do
like the layout of the colors slightly more on this version, though, with
the red being a bit more predominant on the cab while the blue is relegated
to the back half, thus visually separating the two "parts" of the vehicle
mode better. The light milky brownish gray-- unfortunately-- hasn't changed
at all from the previous release of this mold, and is still a pretty dull,
boring (and slightly dirty-looking) color. The flames on the initial version
have been changed to stylized yellow-and-blue lightning bolts on this version,
which certainly fit the whole "racing" theme of this version a bit more,
along with the "01" numbers on the sides of the cab. The silver paint app
above the light blue cab windows also looks great and contrasts well with
both of the surrounding colors. In robot mode-- with the exception of having
lightning bolts on his chest as opposed to flames-- Rally Rumble Optimus
Prime looks almost entirely the same as the original Activator version
given the predominance of the light brownish gray, so my comments on that
mode haven't really changed for this version.

     Rally Rumble Optimus
Prime is a decent enough re-release of the mold for those who want something
a "little different" than the standard Optimus flames, but the lightning
bolts, racing numbers, and the increase in the amount of red on the figure
are the only real differences between this version and the previous. Of
the two color schemes, I think I like this one SLIGHTLY more, but only
just. It's so similar there's no reason for someone who already owns the
original to get this one unless they're Prime completists.

       Optimus Prime makes sure all of the
Autobots know how to fight at high speed. He practices whenever he can
by challenging the other Autobots to dangerous obstacle course races. That
way, Optimus Prime is always ready for a fight at super speeds.
