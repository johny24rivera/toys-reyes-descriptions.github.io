    Wreck-Gar gets his first
Classics-style update with this toy, and in vehicle mode, as expected,
he's a motorcycle. It's not the most aerodynamic of motorcycles- looking
a little bit "old"-- but that, of course, fits for the leader of the Junkions.
The overall silouhette of this mode is pretty darn great, but most of my
problems with this mode-- and this mold, in general-- come from just how
obvious may of the robot bits are in this mode. The arms are clearly folded
up behind the front wheel, the main body is clearly just behind those,
the head pokes out a little from the bottom, it's fairly obvious from the
shape that his toes come up from the front of the seat... it's all just
a bit much and a bit clunky, on a mode that's generally supposed to be
rather seemless. The windshield is also ridiculously small. (On it is contained
Wreck-Gar's "Reveal the Shield" G1-style rubsign, where if you rub it,
it reveals he's an Autobot.) The color scheme of brown, gray, and various
shades of orange-yellow is classic Wreck-Gar, and looks pretty good, though
I wish the gray was a bit less boring-looking of a shade, as opposed to
that blah milky shade they're using on way too many Transformers these
days. The mold detailing is decent enough, being smooth in places where
it should be (such as most of the front part of this mode, to make it more
"aerodynamic"), and more detailed in places it should be, like the motor
chains around the wheels and the pistons and the like on some of the robot
parts. Of course, since it IS supposed to be a Classics-style update of
a G1 character, there isn't as much mold detailing as there's been on the
recent bunch of movie toys, but that's to be expected. Some of the paint
apps are quite well-done, like the nice bronzish-red on the interior of
the tires and the black "flame" paint apps on the sides behind the handlebars.
Using a BLACK flame is a pretty nice twist, to provide some nice contrast
without resorting to the tried-and-true yellow flames, which would tend
to blend in a bit with all of Wreck-Gar's yellowish-orange. Oh, and I almost
forgot to mention one awesome thing about this mode-- as shown above, IT
CAN RIDE ITSELF. Meaning, if you're to either get another Wreck-Gar or
one of the Junkion redecos of this mold, you can have the toy, in robot
mode, ride another of the toy in vehicle mode, just like the Junkions did
in the '80s animated movie. There's slots and and corresponding pegs on
the seat and waist of the mold to ensure they fit on securely, and it's
a great idea that adds quite a bit of fun to this mode. Oh, and there IS
a flip-down kickstand for this mode to keep it stable. (Almost forgot that,
too.)

    A few notes about Wreck-Gar's
transformation-- it's quite easy to get him to robot mode, but getting
him back to vehicle mode requires a bit of patience. It's not a COMPLEX
transformation, but it's one of those where everything has to line up just
so, so it can be a bit annoying. (Always remember to pull the hip pieces
out at the waist when starting-- that's an easy step to forget and you
can't get everything "just so" without it.) Also, there's a bit of an "automorph"
gimmick on Wreck-Gar's right foot-- as you push the windshield bit back,
the rubbery handlebar bits will automatically fold back and the whole bit
will sink into the leg piece a little. It's kinda cool, but do NOT move
the handlebar bits outwards by yourself, as they're rather skinny and can
snap easily. (You'll have to move them back manually when converting him
back to vehicle mode.)

    I honestly don't have
many bad things to say at all about Wreck-Gar's robot mode-- it's almost
certainly the mode that the toy was designed around, and looks great proportionally.
Some may take slight issue with both tires being on the left limbs, but
I think that adds to Wreck-Gar's rather haphazard, "Junkion" look, being
slightly imbalanced like that, so I like it. Both wheels frame the silouhette
quite well here too, instead of just being extraneous kibble. Wreck-Gar's
face sculpt is fantastic, both capturing the character's signature sneer/smile
expression as well as having lots of paint detailing to boot. The chest
details, such as the "engine-like" vents on the stomach, are also pretty
nicely done, and Wreck-Gar has those two gun-like protrusions on the side
of his chest without them being right where... well, right where the nipples
would be were he a human being, as was oddly the case with the G1 toy.
I'm not a huge fan of the yellow flames on the chest, though, as there
were black flames on the vehicle mode-- I think it would've looked a bit
more cohesive if those carried over to the chest detailing here. Still,
they certainly don't look BAD. Wreck-Gar's articulation is excellent--
he can move at the neck (at two places), shoulders (at two places, though
the movement on the left shoulder is a bit restricted because of the wheel
there), and at the elbows (at two spots), the wrists, the waist, the hips
(at three places), the knees, and the ankles (at two places). Given that
his wheels don't add too much to his weight on his left side, this means
you can get him into a ton of cool poses. I will say that Wreck-Gar's weapon
is admittedly rather weak, though. I do like that it fits in nicely with
his vehicle mode and forms an exhaust pipe, but in this mode-- it looks
like a pinwheel. There's no getting around it, the "blades" of this "axe"
simply aren't big and/or long enough to really look like a weapon.

    Autobot Alliance/Reveal
the Shield Wreck-Gar is a great tribute to one of the more unique characters
of G1, particularly in robot mode, and the gimmick of the mold to "ride
itself" is much appreciated, as well. I take issue with how easily visible
the robot parts are in vehicle mode, and his transformation is kind of
annoying-- and though those are big strikes, they're the only real significant
ones against him (the lame weapon is rather minor). Recommended for fans
of the character, or those who want to get two of the mold in some form--
mildly recommended otherwise.

      Wreck-Gar is obsessed with Earth television,
and maybe just a little bit flaky. He communicates almost exclusively in
quotes from commercials and late-night movies, and the grin on his face
never fades, even in the heat of battle. Most Autobots have no idea what
he's talking about most of the time, but they appreciate having his axe
on their side.
