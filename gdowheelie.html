not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Special
Ops Jazz. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance

     Wheelie redecoed from
Jazz is one of those ingenious bits that you never really think would work
until it actually happens, and then, voila! It works! The car mode is pretty
much spot-on for what Wheelie would have taken if he had gotten an "Earth
form". Wheelie's primary colors of orange and a darker pumpkin orange still
stay true on this toy, with the darker color mostly confined to the rims
of his vehicle mode, complementing the regular orange quite well and giving
his vehicle mode quite a bit more visual interest. In fact, there's quite
a few paint apps of several different colors on Wheelie, both to help replicate
his G1 color layout and to give him more variety. All essential details
are painted; his G1-esque pastel blue stripe down the middle of his front
hood; his headlights are painted yellow, his taillights red; and his rear
windows are painted silver, a detail that's often left out because of paint
budgets. Although the dark bluish gray plastic used for Wheelie's... wheels...
and a few other minor parts looks decent enough and serves as a nice dark
neutral color for Wheelie's other colors to go against, the light milky
gray that's mostly revealed in his robot mode is just the same blah shade
of the color that it's always been. Plus, it's light enough where it doesn't
go all that well with the somewhat light main orange plastic color.

     Wheelie has two mold
changes for this version. First, the obvious one-- his head, which is a
straight-up sculpt of his G1 cartoon head design, and looks fantastic.
All the essential elements and paint apps are there, from the gunmetal
gray "hat brim" to Wheelie's goofy grin and blue eyes. Instead of Jazz'
gun, Wheelie also comes with a (non-firing) slingshot accessory, which
of course fits his character, being his signature weapon. (That said, because
of how the weapon is stored in vehicle mode there's an odd peg on one end
of it, and it does stick out a teensy bit below the front fender in vehicle
mode-- though this only becomes obvious if you look at the mode from a
view level with the wheels.)

     "GDO" Wheelie is an
absolutely ingenious remold of Jazz, and works amazingly well. I wish his
light gray was a bit darker or a more metallic shade, but otherwise he's
a surprisingly faithful update to the original, and hey! We finally get
a Wheelie toy that isn't tiny! An incredibly easy recommendation for those
who have a soft spot in their hearts for the little rhyming twerp, and
my favorite of the "GDO" deluxes.

       Though very young, and possibly suffering
from some kind of processor damage from his extended time stranded and
alone on an alien world, Wheelie is a fierce warrior. His rhyming speech
can sometimes annoy the other Autobots, but when push comes to shove, they
appreciate his unerring aim.
