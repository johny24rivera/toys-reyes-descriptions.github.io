    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" deluxe Arcee figure. For a review on the mold itself, read

     Arcee is another of the
Beast Hunters upgrades that is a massive remold of her original Prime deluxe
toy. Arcee's upgrade follows the typical Beast Hunters style of "spiking
out" her aesthetic and making her look a bit more beastly. In her case,
there's a ton of extra fins added to the vehicle mode in particular, and--
given her coloring-- they make her look almost like a fish-bike, which
is a rather interesting combination. The most obvious fins are on her rear
wheels, the sides of her main body, and on the sides of the rear of her
motorcycle seat. She also has a lot of armor-like "ornamental" detailing
all across the remolded pieces (which are nearly all of the large vehicle
pieces, as well as her robot head, lower arms, and weapon, which I'll talk
about shortly). The armor-like, layered nature looks almost like a carapace,
which is fitting given the aquatic nature of her upgrade. Her robot head
is very recognizably Arcee, though the pink antennae now looks more like
a "fin", and she has more intricate detailing along her helmet, all of
which looks pretty neat. Her proportionally massive new weapon is a skeletal-looking
crossbow, complete with two spring-loaded missile launchers (which are,
unfortunately, on a bit of a hair trigger). Her best new mold detailing
is here, with more carapace detailing, spikes, and a rather evil-looking
face molded onto the body of the crossbow. It's a neat weapon, though it's
so big compared to Arcee's skinny arms that she admittedly looks a little
ridiculous holding such a huge weapon. The weapon also secures around the
vehicle mode surprisingly well, giving an extra "layer" of armor, of sorts.

     Arcee's color scheme
keeps the black and dark blue of her original version, though the dark
blue itself is a bit darker this time around, with an ever-so-slight purplish
tint to it, which helps it complement her other main color of lavender
mixed w/ dark purple quite well. I really love the "mixed plastic colors"
idea of most of the deluxe Beast Hunters toys, and Arcee is definitely
no exception, giving more variety to her look without adding in the expense
of more paint applications. More evident in her robot mode is a pale bluish
gray with some dark blue mixed in, again a nice complement to both the
lavender and the dark blue. There's some silver and bright "safety" orange
details mixed in here and there for accents, and both work well, particularly
the orange which is a good contrast color against the dark blue. There's
also some glossy off-white on her face and pink on her head antennae-fin,
both of which are more accurate to the show in their shading than on the
original Prime RiD deluxe toy. All this said, Arcee's lavender is a bit
TOO pale, and when added to the light gray and light bluish gray of her
weapon and robot mode, make her color scheme look a bit lighter and paler
than I'd like-- I wish the dark blue was a bit more prevalent that it is.
I also do wish Arcee's pale transparent plastic used for her windshield
was a bit darker or perhaps light purple to mix in with her overall scheme
a bit better, and her weapon-- as large as it is-- desperately needs some
paint apps on it, though the rest of her color scheme is diversified enough
in terms of color breakup.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Beast Hunters Arcee's
color scheme may be a slight step downwards from her deluxe Prime RiD version,
but the mold changes are awesome-- I love how much extra flair all her
fish-like "fins" give her-- particularly in motorcycle mode-- and her crossbow
is awesomely detailed, if a bit overly large. Recommended over the deluxe
Prime RiD Arcee toy if you're at all into the "Beast Hunters Autobots/Decepticons"
aesthetic.

        Arcee has been watching the pattern
of attacks on her fellow Autobots with great interest. They are savage
and devastating, yes, but they are also random. What's more, the Decepticons
have been nowhere to be seen. Her tactical processors tell her that the
Decepticon forces are in chaos-- and just as concerned about the Predacon
threat as the Autobots are. That's why, when she finds herself tracking
Ripclaw to a hidden cave deep in the Canadian Rockies, she transmits the
location directly to the Decepticons. Why should the Autobots risk themselves
against the Predacons when the Decepticons are probably more than willing
to do it for them?
