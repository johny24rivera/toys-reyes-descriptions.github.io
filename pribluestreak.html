    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime Beast
Hunters legion Smokescreen. For a review on the mold itself, read the review

     Boy, Hasbro is really
getting their mileage out of this mold, aren't they? Anyways, Bluestreak
here is meant to complete the Prime universe versions of the G1 triad of
     <a href="pricyprowl.html">
      Prowl
     </a>
     ,
Smokescreen, and himself. However, this version of Bluestreak has a more
original color scheme than just apeing
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      his
G1 colors
     </a>
     -- one that's loosely inspired by the "blue" variant of Bluestreak,
mainly in how much
     <i>
      blue
     </i>
     he has. Blue is most definitely the main
color of the toy, being the plastic color for almost every part, and thankfully,
it's a really nice shade of blue-- being dark but not overly dull, and
quite eye-catching. There's also a bit of black on his front and side windows
(not his rear windows, sadly), wheels, and a few minor robot pieces, which
looks alright but can blend in with the dark blue a bit too easily in vehicle
mode. No, what really helps this version of Bluestreak stand out are his
new colors-- namely, light green and white. The white in particular contrasts
exceedingly well against both the dark blue and the black, and it really
helps make the vehicle mode in particular, while also contributing some
nice contrast to the robot mode as well on the legs and the face. It's
not so prevalent that it makes Bluestreak look too similar to Prowl and/or
Smokescreen, though, which is good. All that said, I do wish the white
extended just a bit more to the back end of the car mode-- there's really
no paint back there whatsoever, which makes for a fairly uninteresting
spot on what is otherwise a well-painted toy. The light green makes for
a great accent color on the headlights, robot eyes, and robot knees, going
exceedingly well with the dark blue again while not being so bright that
it clashes against the white. The lime green plastic used for Bluestreak's
chainsaw-gun weapon is also a similar (and similarly awesome) shade of
the color, to boot, even if it's not the most realistic color for a weapon.
On a side note, there's a bit of light red that's only used for some of
the front headlights-- it looks nice and adds a bit more to the color scheme,
but it's not used nearly enough to be a major contributor to my opinion
of the toy overall.

     Beast Hunters Bluestreak
is a fantastic redeco of an admittedly mediocre Cyberverse mold-- but it
does give the trio a sense of "completeness", and I do love that Hasbro
went outside of the predictable direction and instead gave Bluestreak a
mostly new color scheme while still making it obvious why he's called Bluestreak.
I wish he had some paint on the rear third or so of his vehicle mode, but
other than that he's pretty much flawless as far as his color scheme is
concerned-- he's my favorite version of this mold. It's a shame he was
released in such limited quantities outside of the U.S., as I'd love for
more people to be able to get their hands on this beautiful little toy.
