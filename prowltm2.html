    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 hunter owl. This mode is one of the best Transmetal 2 modes I've seen,
and is very evenly balanced with practically no extras. The only noticeable
extras are the robot hands under his tail feathers, but these do not get
in the way. One of the most interesting features is the head, because of
three things: 1. The head can rotate 360 degress, sort of like a real owl's
can! 2. One of the owl's eyes is normal, but the other is just some detailing
with a large transparent orange plate on top, giving this owl a "cyborg"
look to it. 3. The orb on top of his head has a microchip look to it. It
can also be flipped around to reveal his Maximal allegiance orb.

    Robot mode is not as
good as the beast mode, but still looks very nice. The organic/robotic
mix is the same as the beast mode. One of the problems, however, is that
the owl head, which becomes his chest, gets in the way because it is so
large and rotates a lot when you don't want it to. Another one of the problems
with this mode is that the owl wings, which are supposed to snap in place,
don't, and tend to wiggle a lot. He has very small robot arms when compared
to other deluxe Transformers, but this is probably so it doesn't get in
the way in beast mode. His face still retains that cyborg look, with one
eye being slanted and the other being round.

    A nice Transformer,
but when transforming, it is somewhat difficult to find exactly where the
main part of his body is supposed to rotate to. If you don't understand
this comment, you will when you get Prowl.

     <font face="OCR A Extended">
      Prowl strives to find logic and reason
in everything. A listener, not a talker. Has most sophisticated logic center
of the Maximals. Able to analyze and advise on complex combat situations
almost instantaneously. Fires highly corrosive acid pellets. Cybernetic
eye and frontal lobe interact with wing-mounted ion orbs, supplying limited
telekinetic power. Afflicted with ironic, dry sense of humor. Believes
himself to have been a great military strategist in a former life.
