    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 3-step
Grimlock toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     "Stealthasaurus Rex"
honestly would be kind of a cool name without the Grimlock name following
it. As it is, it's kind of a mouthful. Maybe just "Stealthasaurus Grimlock"?
Anyways, by the standard of most redecoes today, Stealthsaurus Grim isn't
a huge change from the original. The green plastic is the exact same shade
as on the original 3-step changer; same with the light milky gray plastic
(it's also in the same places too, for that matter). There's only two major
changes that have been made to this Stealthasaurus redeco, and the first
is the addition of more black. The base color for Grimlock's robot arms/dino
legs is now black as opposed to green. I guess that makes him stealthy?
Well, it certainly makes him more boring-- without that extra green there's
a bit too much black on him, particularly in robot mode, if you ask me.
The other major change is that many of the green (or black) paint apps
from the original have been replaced with a dull mustard yellow. I'm not
really sure how exactly this is "Stealthsaurus"... is it supposed to represent
his copper, but dulled down so he can sneak around? But then those parts
weren't copper on the original... Huh. Well, anyways, it contrasts against
the black alright, but it's still dull, and doesn't pop nearly as much
as a brighter shade of the color would have. In keeping with the "less
than your typical redeco" job Hasbro did with Stealthasaurus Grimlock,
the paint masks are even the same-- the mustard yellow paint apps are all
in the exact same spots that the green or black paint was on the original
figure. Also in keeping with that feel, the light blue on the eyes in both
modes is the same here as on the original, as is the silver on the t-rex
face and teeth. The bronze dino headcrest has been replaced with a mustard
yellow headcrest on this version, which again, looks similar but not as
exciting. the black "eyebrow" paint apps on the dino head are gone, but
they aren't replaced with anything elsewhere on the figure, unfortunately.
In robot mode, Grimlock's face is now silver as opposed to copper-- both
negative changes that don't look that exciting.

     Stealthasaurus Rex Grimlock
isn't much of a redeco-- he takes the color scheme of the original 3-step
changer, but adds more black and dulls most of the other colors, making
him look relatively bland in comparison. It's still a pretty good 3-step
changer mold, but given that the original is better AND much easier to
get, there's no reason to get this redeco unless you're a Grimlock completist.
