    For a deluxe-sized toy,
Cannon Blast Megatron's tank mode is... really, really weak. It looks exactly
like what it is-- his robot bend over on itself three times. In particular,
it's painfully obvious that his treads are his robot legs. The turret and
a few tread details on his legs are the only parts about this mode that
say it's a tank, honestly. And the turret can't even rotate or move up
and down to fire its spring-loaded missile! What's up with that? I understand
the need to simplify the transformations of the Fast Action Battlers given
who they're aimed at, but they should at least LOOK like what they're supposed
to be in both modes. Heck, the
    <a href="rotflegmegatron.html">
     Legends
    </a>
    version of Megatron's vehicle mode looks better than this robot-yoga alt
mode with several noticeable gaps you can see through. The color scheme
of gray, silver, and black is prety boring too, though hey, that's Movie
Megatron for ya. He DOES have quite a impressive amount of mold detailing,
though, with little mechanical alien-esque details covering his form, which
is particularly impressive for a Fast Action Battler.

    Megatron's robot mode
is definitely what the toy was designed around, but it still has some problems.
For starters, the head doesn't stick out far enough from the shoulders--
it looks like it's practically hidden in between his shoulder-shards. (On
the plus side, though, having his head slide up out of the chest as you
bring his arms forward during transformation is pretty cool.) His arms
each also have their own unique problem-- the left one is way too tiny
even considering it's Megatron's "gimp" arm, and for some weird unknown
reason he can only move his arm forward VERY slightly at the elbow on that
arm, though it can rotate all the way backwards. Go figure. His large arm
has a cool flip-out sword, but due to some weak "chopping action" this
arm will swing downwards and you have to force-ratchet it upwards if you
want it to pose it pointing forward or anything, and then force-ratchet
it back downwards if you want the chopping motion to look right. That gimmick
we really could've done without, Hasbro. Also, the right arm has no elbow
articulation to speak of. The legs, though a bit restricted when it comes
to side-to-side movememtn, are quite nice-looking though, and the chest
looks particularly great painted up in all that shiny silver (though it
does make his unpainted gray plastic look all that more dull). As far as
overall articluation goes, Megatron can move at the neck (slightly), the
shoulders (with the aforementioned ratcheting caveat on his right arm),
the left elbow (slightly), the hips, and the knees (slightly). So he's
hardly the most posable Transformer, though then again that's not really
the
focus of the Fast Action Battler line so I'm more forgiving of it here
than I would be if this were a mainline toy.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Cannon Blast Megatron
is a pretty weak Fast Action Battler even considering the inherent "simplification"
aspect of the line, with a mode that just barely looks like what it's supposed
to be and a robot mode that, although it looks good for the most part,
has very limited articulation, an annoying gimmick in the right arm, and
a chest practically hidden between his shoulder-shards. Not recommended
unless you're getting it for a particularly young Megatron fan who simply
must have a transformable toy of the Decepticon leader.

      In his new form, Megatron is more powerful
than ever before. Thicker armor means even the most advanced human weapons
can't hurt him, while his upgraded fusion cannon melts heavily armored
vehicles into scrap. Enraged by his defeat in the battle over the AllSpark,
he is determined to let nothing stand in the way of his revenge.
