    Wow, what an amazing
robot-laying-down-with-his-neck-broken mode! Oh, wait, what's that? That's
supposed to be Starscream's VEHICLE mode?! Oh..... oh.
    <i>
     Oh
    </i>
    . Because
I see jets with cockpits near the back, nosecones that take up more than
half of the vehicle, a head in place of its engine, and arms sticking out
of the wings all the time. Yeeeah. At least he copies his toy color scheme
pretty well, but, really... that's about all the positive stuff I have
to say for this "mode".

    With a vehicle mode
that poor, it's a good thing Starscream has a prety darned decent robot
mode for a Happy Meal toy. The proportions are pretty spot on, with only
the tailfins on the back really being any sort of extras whatsoever. As
far as articulation goes, his arms can move front-to-back at the shoulders,
his legs can move side-to-side, and his head can rotate. That doesn't sound
like a lot-- and it's not-- but it's a lot better than most of the other
McAnimated toys, so that's a slight positive in Starscream's favor. The
mold detailing is pretty good-- particularly on the head-- and is certainly
very Animated-y, and he actually has a fair amount of paint detailing,
with the important stuff like his head, wing stripes, and cockpit-chest
being painted. He IS missing his nullrays on the sides of his arms, though.
Kinda of an odd omission, there.

    McStarscream has pretty
much the best robot mode out of the McAnimated Happy Meal toys, but he
pays for it BIG time with an absolutely horrific "vehicle mode" that is
literally his robot mode laying down with his head turned around. Get the

    </a>
    if you really can't afford the
    <a href="anistarscream.html">

    ,
but even for essentially free this guy isn't worth it for anyone but the
most hardcore Starscream fans.
