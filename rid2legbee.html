    Bumblebee's sportscar
alt mode is replicated quite well for his Legion-class mold, with pretty
much spot-on proportions and basically no robot mode extras whatsoever.
(On the back end, you can see just a BIT of the lower portion of his head/neck
piece below the fender, but this is a minor issue at best.) Even though
RID2015 toys generally have minimal mold detailing, at this scale even
that mold detailing looks pretty good, with all of the necessary details
molded in, like the stripes on the sides, the stripes with "vents" on the
front hood, the front grill, and the rear headlights, all molded in a rather
angular fashion, as befits his design. In addition to the base yellow plastic,
he also has black paint on ALL of his windows (including the rear ones),
red on the taillights, and a nice shade of blue on the headlights. However,
he's BumbleBEE, and that means that particularly for his modern incarnations
he needs stripes-- particularly the main two stripes on his hood, which
are not painted on at all and thus make him look slightly more plain than
he should in this mode. Still, given the black windows and wheels contrasting
well enough with the yellow he's still not bad. There's a peg on each side
of this mode in front of the rear tire that can hold a Cyberverse-scaled
weapon, but sadly he doesn't come with any. The RID2015 "scan insignia"
is on the front of his right car door, a rather awkward place for it--
though to be fair, given his transformation, it couldn't have been put
in a less obnoxious place like on his hood or anything.

    Although it's hardly
difficult, Bumblebee's transformation is a bit more complex than usual
for a Legion-class toy; there's a couple of extra odd flips you have to
do with the head and chest to get everything in place for the robot mode.
The end result is a bit less than satisfactory, to be honest. The head
and chest look very awkward; for one, the head is far too small, and actually
sticks out above the chest a little too far. As for the chest itself, it's
too long and at a very odd angle compared to the rest of the toy. I appreciate
that they were trying to use the front window of the car mode to actually
be the black stripe on 'Bee's chest, but it just doesn't work here. The
arms are too long proportionally as well, made up of both the back bumper
AND the entire side of the car mode, and because of the angle of the chest
the pivot point for them at the shoulders is a bit too far back. Even for
a Legion they're also a little too 2-D, with only the hands (which can
hold Cyberverse-scale weapons) juuust poking out from the car shells the
arms are molded into. The legs, on the plus side, are pretty solid, with
pretty decent proportions, nice flip-down toes, and they just look much
more show-accurate than the rest of this mode. As for paint apps exclusively
for this mode, there's some silver on the face and upper legs, blue on
the eyes, and black on the toes. It's not much, but the rest of 'Bee's
yellow is broken up enough by his black plastic and vehicle mode paint
where monotony isn't an issue. For articulation, Bumblebee can move at
the shoulders (at two points), hips, and slightly forward at the ankles--
roughly average for a Legion figure.

Bumblebee is one of the weakest toys of this character, at least that isn't
a 1-step or a combiner component. The vehicle mode looks quite nice (albeit
lacks his signature stripes), but his robot mode body is incredibly awkward,
with a chest that is far too long and angled, a tiny head, and arms that
are too long and 2-D. If you want a simple-to-transform 'Bee, I'd recommend
one of the many 3-step versions of him instead.
