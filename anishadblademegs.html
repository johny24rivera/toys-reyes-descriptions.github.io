    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated Leader
Megatron. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Megatron's new color
scheme certainly evokes the "Shadow Blade" prefix to his name. He's almost
all black. In fact, minus the transparent fuchsia plastic used for his
helicopter cockpit and the clear parts in his robot chest and optics, ALL
of his plastic parts are completely black. This would have a tendency to
get boring, but Megatron has quite a few dark metallic purple and metallic
silver paint apps on him (with the latter having an ever-so-slightly purple
hue to it as well). These break up the black quite a bit, especially the
silver-- having it on the gun and copter blades looks really cool. The
purple also looks quite good against the black, and I LOVE the stylized
paint decorations used with the color (particularly on the chest), but
unfortunately it's a bit too dark. If light isn't shining on it fairly
directly, it tends to fade in with the surrounding black. Having it a slightly
lighter shade of purple-- perhaps the more straightforward royal purple
used on his chin and chest in robot mode-- would have made the toy look
even cooler than it already is.

     No mold changes have

     Shadow Blade Megatron
is an excellent, fairly imaginative redeco, with the silver, purple, and
black working together quite well. If the purple was a tad lighter it would
have been saliva-inducing in its coolness, but it's still pretty neat.
Recommended over the original Leader Megatron, easily.

       In preparation for returning to space,
Megatron repaints his armor. He prefers these colors, because they allow
him to disappear against the dark background of outer space. There, his
actions are made silent by the vacuum, and blackness hides his movements.
Hidden in the dark, he seems to attack from nowhere. He is a ghost in the
cosmos, striking down his enemies without hesitation, and without mercy.
