    Hound's alternate mode
is a military transport, and is captured pretty accurately as a Power Battler.
The proportions are near-perfect; no issues there at all. The colors are
generally fitting for Hound, too, taking the accurate dark military green
and adding a fair amount of grayish brown, which contrasts and complements
the dark green while also just being a fitting color for a military alt
mode, even it's not used on the vehicle in the movie to near the extent
it's used on this toy. There aren't any large patches of only one color,
which is always good-- that said, given the sheer amount of outstanding
mold detailing on this guy, there's lots of details that are begging for
some paint. The front windows are painted silver, but the side windows
are not; other details like handlebars, spare tire detailing near the center
of the figure, and bumpers are all bereft of paint, as well. The abrupt
transfer from dark green on the sides of the rear end to grayish brown
in the middle of the back end also looks rather odd. In general this mode
is robot extra-free from most normal angles, but some robot parts show
up from a head-on or side-on look at eye level. Hound's gun and fists do
stick out below the bottom of the vehicle a bit to the point where it interferes
with him rolling on a level surface slightly, though that's small potatoes
compared to his head just being RIGHT THERE underneath the front section,
between the two tires; I wish there was a panel or something to cover that
up. On a very minor additional note, you can juuust make out the tips of
Hound's (unpainted) wheel-heels on the upper back end of this mode, but
again-- small potatoes.

    Hound's transformation
mostly consists of turning his vehicle mode inside-out via a couple of
simple panel flips. This results in a robot mode that is a bit more square
than you'd think-- the panels that make up the sides of his main body are
a bit too flat and the wheels that come off the front of his chest certainly
aren't movie-accurate, and his legs are merely molded onto the inside of
the panels that form the back half of the vehicle mode (though they are,
at least, detailing that sticks out a fair amount so you see them as legs
BEFORE you see them as part of two large panels-- that said, the legs are
definitely still the weakest part of this toy). The four wheels sticking
out the front of the legs are unsightly, as well. Still, legs aside this
is a pretty good robot mode given the restrictions of the Power Battler
price point and complexity. The mold detailing continues to be darned impressive
in this mode, with pistons and the like on his legs all detailed, along
with (non-removable) guns and painted wheel-feet. He also has a great,
fairly accurate chest sculpt, even if his gut from his movie model isn't
really present for transformation purposes. His headsculpt is pretty spot-on,
sporting a dark green military helmet and a scraggly black "wire" beard
that really helps give this design a lot of character, as do the ammo clips
on the arms. The paint detailing in this mode is also thankfully much more
evident-- much of it is for black coloration on his arms and legs, though
his chest also has a fair amount of dark green paint and his head is wonderfully
painted, with a silver face and the usual Autobot bright blue eyes. Hound's
Power Battler gimmick is "quick draw", and it's pretty cool without being
all that obtrusive-- pulling back on the small tab at the top of Hound's
right shoulder will cause that arm to swing forward a bit, the gun that's
normally slung underneath that arm rotating forward so it looks like he's
ready to shoot whatever's ticking him off currently. It's one of my favorite
Power Battler gimmicks, is addictive, and the orange paint looks great
against the black of the gun. For articulation, Hound can move at the left
shoulder (at two points), right elbow, and I suppose he can rotate a little
at the hips, though the further you rotate his legs out the more awkward
they look given how all the leg detailing is only on one side of those
leg panels. (All of the articulation in his right arm is spring-loaded--
if you let go of the tab, it automatically retracts the arm back to its
default position.) It's not much, but given the transformation I'm not
sure how they could have fit in anything more than head rotation.

    Power Battler Hound
is one of my favorites from the subline. Yes, he has very restricted articulation
in robot mode and some obvious panel issues in said mode, but his downsides
are somewhat minimal. His "Quick Draw" is cool, his transformation is simple
yet effective, he's got great mold detailing and decent paint detailing,
and he's got good proportions in both modes. He's not a super-articulated,
poseable 'bot, but he's not meant to be. A fun, basic figure that's a good
substitute if you can't find/afford the voyager version.
