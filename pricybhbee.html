    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" legion Bumblebee. For a review on the mold itself, read the

     Like many of the Beast
Hunters Autobot &amp; Decepticon toys, legion Beast Hunters Bumblebee shares
the exact same design, base proportions, and a few small pieces with the
initial version of the legion Prime Bumblebee mold, but the detailing has
been changed on nearly all the parts-- he now looks considerably more armed
up and "battle-ready" than he did before. His vehicle mode is covered with
details that looks like armor plating-- this is particularly obvious on
the black-painted parts on the sides, the more angular grill, the spikes
to the side of his front wheels, the dual-barreled cannon in place of his
exposed engine, and some raised armor plates on his back end. In robot
mode, his head is more triangle-shaped and bird-like, while his stomach
has more defined "ribs" and his feet are a bit more round than on the previous
versions of this mold. He's not nearly as changed as his larger Beast Hunters
deluxe, though, still looking relatively smooth everywhere except his spikes.
The mold still has the three Cyberverse ports in the same places as they
were on the original, however, and Bumblebee's weapon has been changed,
to a gray "Eagleshot Bow" that's also used for several other Beast Hunters
legion-class figures, which has some pretty good mold detailing on it as
well.

     His color scheme is
more or less the same as on his initial version, though the yellow is of
a slightly lighter, more milky shade than on the original. His paint apps
are also a tad more sparse, mostly consisting of black paint on some of
his armor plating, windows, and knees, while his face and engine-gun are
painted silver. A few more paint apps-- particularly on the back end of
his vehicle mode, rear windows, and/or his robot mode details-- would've
helped him look a bit more exciting visually and brought out all these
neat armored details.

     Beast Hunters Cyberverse
Bumblebee is a decent "amped up" remold, but it isn't changed nearly to
the fun extent that most of the other Beast Hunters Autobots &amp; Decepticons
were changed. Add to this his less-exciting paint apps and a shade of yellow
that doesn't look as good to me as the orangish-yellow of the original,
and I actually prefer the way the original versions of this mode look.
If you're wanting a Beast Hunters Bumblebee, go with the deluxe mold or
one of the better-painted versions of this mold (it's not like this model
shows up in the show, so you don't have to worry about show accuracy).
