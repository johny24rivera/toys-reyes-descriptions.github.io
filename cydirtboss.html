    Dirt Boss' vehicle mode
is a highly futuristic monster truck-- a perfect alt mode for the name.
Obviously, a monster truck might not be the first vehicle you'd expect
to find on a Speed Planet, but the Key Gimmick rectifies that-- by plugging
his Speed Planet Key into the rear of the vehicle, the wheels move outwards
more while the main body moves downwards, to make the vehicle look like
it's capable of being much speedier. The wheels look much better in this
position, I think-- in their "normal" position, they look like they're
too far separated from the main body to the point where the look awkward.
Another, more minor, problem with this mode is the fact that the robot
hands are rather easily visible near the rear of the vehicle. But other
than those two beefs, the rest of Dirt Boss' vehicle mode looks great.
I love the futuristic paneling detailed on his main body, and the exhaust
pipes to the rear and the exposed engine on the front hood help to make
Dirt Boss look all the more speedier. He also has a drivers' seat and console
molded inside the cockpit, though it's hard to see because the transparent
plastic is so dark. He has a decent amount of paint detailing as well,
though a few more silver paint apps near the rear of the vehicle mode are
needed. His overall color scheme is very good, too-- purple and green are
definitely Decepticon colors, and they look good on a futuristic "rough
'n tough" truck such as this. The bit of charcoal black and silver help
to give the scheme a bit more variety, too (even if just plain black would've
worked a little better).

    Dirt Boss' robot mode
is also very good, though it does suffer from a few flaws. For one, his
head hovers just a little above the chest without anything to anchor it
down (think
    <a href="enjetfire.html">
     Energon Jetfire
    </a>
    ). The Key gimmick
activates something different in this mode-- plug it in, and the exhaust
pipes swing over Dirt Boss' shoulders to become guns. However, though it's
a cool gimmick, it reveals another flaw-- the guns are slightly uneven,
at least on mine. One points more downwards, while the other points straight
ahead as it should. It's not a huge deal, but it is a little distracting.
Many Transfans don't seem to like the four large wheels hanging off the
sides of Dirt Boss', but I actually think they add to the mode-- they give
the mode more bulk and weight than it otherwise would have, and thus makes
Dirt Boss look more like a force to be reckoned with, I think. They get
in the way of backward arm articulation a little, and make Dirt Boss a
tad back heavy, but otherwise I don't have any problem with them. And speaking
of articulation, Dirt Boss has a ton of it-- he can move in any place you
could reasonably expect on a deluxe-sized figure except from side-to-side
at the elbows, meaning you can get him into a number of cool poses. His
proportions are overall pretty nice too, though I perhaps would've made
his legs a little bulkier. His head sculpting is also awesome-- the rotating
telescope over his right optic looks really cool (even if it doesn't actually
rotate, it's too small-- but it looks like it should). His head also has
a really unique, steamlined design to it.

    Dirt Boss is a fine
Decepticon, with a alt mode that hasn't been done in years and a well-proportioned
robot mode. They way his wheels are positioned normally in his vehicle
mode look rather odd, however, and it does bug me a little that his guns
are uneven in robot mode and his head hovers a bit off his chest. But I
still recommend him-- he's a unique, cool Decepticon to add to your ranks.

      A wild outlaw, rugged villain of the
rough backwaters of the Speed Planet; those who are fooled by the sheer
size of Dirt Boss into thinking he's slow are soon left choking on his
exhaust. He lives to pound his opponents into the dust and leave them spinning
their wheels - that's if he decides to leave the wheels attached. Hot Shot
is certain to learn some tough lessons from him.
