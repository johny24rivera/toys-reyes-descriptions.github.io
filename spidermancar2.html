    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Marvel TF
Spider-Man race car. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Marvel TF Spider-Man race car

     Predictably, the race
car version of Spider-Man has gotten a "symbiote"-flavored repaint, much
like the first
     <a href="spidermanblack.html">
      motorcycle version
     </a>
     of
the character. Considering that the color schemes are pretty much identical,
my comments on the overall black costume color scheme are pretty much the
same here. Black and white would make for an interesting color scheme--
provided there was more color variety. This toy is almost entirely black
plastic, and white is relegated to a few paint apps here or there, with
the only major white paint apps being those symbiote spider symbols. (What's
weird is that the symbol used for the mech mode chest is partially, but
not completely, covered up by the cockpit in vehicle mode, making it look
a bit odd in that mode.) There are a few, very minor, instances of other
colors-- namely just the red paint used for the taillights and the gray/silvery
plastic and paint used for the vehicle mode tailpipes and the "wrist blasters"
in mech mode, respectively-- but it's not nearly enough to keep him from
looking really monochrome. And boring, quite frankly.

     No mold changes have
been made to the black costume version of the Spider-Man race car.

     Even though black is
more fitting for a race car than a blue/red combo, this toy is almost completely
black, with a a bit of white here and there. (The other colors are used
so few times they're essentially nonexistent.) I really wish they had given
the other colors a bit more of a presence on this mold, as it really could've
looked cool then. But as it is, it's just way too much black and not enough
anything else. I'd recommend the first version over this one.

       This is the ultimate Spider-Man battle
suit. Even faster and stronger than the last one, it amps up the wall-crawler's
powers to their maximum limit. When he stomps into battle piloting this
powerful mech, no villain stands a chance!
