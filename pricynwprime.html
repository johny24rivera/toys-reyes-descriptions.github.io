    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots
in Disguise" commander Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself,
read the review of the original Prime "Robots in Disguise" commander Optimus

     I WISH this Nightwatch
Optimus Prime was as different from the initial iteration of this mold
as
     <a href="nightwatchprime.html">
      2007 Movie Nightwatch Optimus Prime
     </a>
     was from his original iteration. Unfortunately, this is another of those
"barely repaint" repaints. The red plastic and parts are the exact same
here as on the original commander Optimus Prime toy from this line, as
is the transparent light blue plastic. What changes there are to Nightwatch
Optimus Prime give him a largely duller, darker color scheme. The most
obvious is that there's more gray on him, with the back section of his
vehicle mode being that color now instead of the more interesting dark
blue on the original version of this toy. However, at least it's not that
same, ultra-bland light milky gray that's on so many Transformers toys;
no, this is a slightly more glossy, semi-metallic shade of the color that--
while not painted-- looks better than the usual light gray on TFs. In robot
mode, there's a little more black on his head and front legs. However,
this only looks black at first glance-- it's actually a very dark, glossy
dull blue. It's a decent enough color, but there's too much "black" and
not enough "blue" in it, so it ends up making Nightwatch Optimus' colors
even more dull. The only exception to this rule are the extra yellow paint
apps on Optimus' upper robot legs and on his vehicle headlights-- they
really contrast well with all the silver/black around them, and add some
badly needed light accents to Nightwatch Optimus' color scheme.

     Surprisingly, Nightwatch
Optimus Prime DOES have some mold changes-- specifically, to his head and
weapons. His head has a faceplate-less sculpt now, and it's spot-on to
the show. His weapons are also now his sword attachments, which can be
held in his hands to make it look like they're coming out of his lower
arms, just like in the show. I think these work a little better than the
blasters on the first version of this toy, and quite like these accessories,
as simple as they are.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Nightwatch Optimus Prime
is for a very select group of Transformers fans-- those who are either
Optimus Prime completists or who perhaps want a "Nemesis Prime" toy in
a show-accurate color scheme (and can ignore the Autobot symbol on this
toy). Otherwise, skip this toy and get the first version if you want this
mold-- except for the sword accessories, Nightwatch Optimus is blander
than the original in every way, and is largely pointless.

       Optimus Prime is not built for stealth,
but long years of fighting have taught him that some skills are worth learning.
Sometimes, a frontal assault is the wrong move. When it's time for a sneak
attack, the Autobot leader is one of the most dangerous silent warriors
around.
