not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

     Like the other pre-Beast
Wars figures released in this year's set, Darksyde Dinobot (the prefix
is after the Predacon ship, which now has an official name, Darksyde) is
spot-on with his Beast Wars form when it comes to colors-- not so much
with the
     <a href="dinobot.html">
      original Beast Wars toy
     </a>
     as with its
     <a href="10thdinobot.html">
      10th Anniversary Edition
     </a>
     , but the latter
was more show-accurate in colors anyways. The amounts of muddy bronzish
brown and dark brown have been switched, however, as giving the toy more
dark brown is better for a construction vehicle, anyways. Both colors still
work marvelously together, though, and if anything the bronzish brown makes
a better accent color than a main color. There's also some of Dinobot's
trademark light blue, though the blue could stand to be a shade or two
darker to be completely show-accurate. It's not at all clashy or loud,
however, I just think that at this shade, it could've been used in a few
less places on the toy. A new color, light gray, has also been added to
the legs, to make Dinobot look more vehicle-y in his colors than he otherwise
would have. The bronzish brown "stripe" paint apps on the upper arms are
my favorite of the paint apps, given that they hearken to Dinobot's Beast
Wars form without being too blatantly beast-ish, though all of the paint
apps are quite good. The silver paint apps on the tips of Dinobot's fingers
also help to make them look more like claws, though they don't look all
that great against the light blue. Transformation-wise, this mold was a
fairly good choice for Dinobot as well, the giant shovel-arm aside-- the
"head" of the vehicle becomes the chest, the underside becomes the legs,
and the sides become the arms, just like on the Beast Wars toy.

     What's especially interesting
about this toy is that, though there aren't any mold changes per se, they've
kept
     <a href="longrack.html">
      Cybertron Longrack's
     </a>
     mold with the Cyber
Key-activated shovel-arm while switching out Longrack's head for Armada
Hoist's! It's always been remarked at how similar Hoist's head looked to
Dinobot's, and now that's finally come to fruition with this toy. The paint
apps are spot-on Dinobot, certainly, but although it's easy to see Dinobot
in the face, it IS a little chubby for the guy. Also, like all the other
toys in the Botcon set, the Cyber Key used in the Cybertron version has
instead been replaced with a solid gray Planet X Key bearing a Predacon
symbol and a painted bit of Golden Disk detailing over the main part of
the Cyber Key, hence the new name "Golden Disk Key".

     Darksyde Dinobot has
an excellent, very attractive color scheme, with some quite ingenious paint
applications to relate the toy further to his Beast Wars form. The blue
being a shade or two too light is my only real complaint in that respect.
Definitely the best color scheme this toy has had so far, though obviously
it will cost you more than the other versions of the mold if you want to
own it.

       Like many of his Predacon brethren,
"Dinobot" is a proud warrior. He feels a sense of entitlement borne of
being descended from the powerful Decepticon Empire. During his studies
of military history, Dinobot decided that the fall of the Decepticons largely
stemmed from dishonorable infighting and power struggles within the Decepticon
army. He resolved to live his life in an honorable fashion both in and
out of battle. He believes such discipline is the key to ultimate power
and victory. In robot mode, Dinobot is one of the most skilled hand-to-hand
combatants among the Predacons. His study of numerous ancient martial arts
has allowed him to develop a unique fighting style of his own that conforms
to his present body-form. He specializes in channeling energy through his
large shovel arm, heating the blades at the edge ip to temperatures of
4,000 degrees Celcius, allowing him to slice through enemy armor with ease.
His desire to join Megatron was fueled by what he perceived as cowardice
and sloth by the Tripredacus Council in their lack of overt offensive action
against the Maximal Imperium.
