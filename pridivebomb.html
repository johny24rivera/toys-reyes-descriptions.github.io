    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Hunters
Windrazor toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original Beast Hunters Windrazor figure

     No, this isn't a mistake--
despite being a mold that is distinctly a Predacon, it looks like Divebomb
"found the light" and jointed the Autobots. I actually like this aspect
of this redeco, as it makes it a bit more unique and, in fact, the Autobot
insignias are hidden from most angles (they're painted on the bottom of
Divebomb's wings, only visible if you splay the wings all the way open).
It gives the dude a bit more "mystery". As far as the color scheme, Divebomb
is almost certainly a light Swoop homage, with his gray, red, and gold
definitely calling back to the G1 Dinobots' color schemes-- though there
are different amounts of some of these colors on Divebomb compared to the
traditional Dinobot scheme. The gray is roughly of the same amount, being
one of the main dominant colors-- unfortunately, it's of that really boring
shade of light milky gray that really should have had some metallic glitter
in it to make it more appealing, or at least have been a bit darker to
call back to the G1 Dinobots a bit more clearly. Red is considerably more
apparent on Divebomb than the G1 Dinobots', making up the shade of plastic
for almost his entire body, tail, upper legs, and upper arms. There's nothing
particularly mind-blowing about this shade-- it's just your regular shade
of red-- but it contrasts quite nicely against the other colors, the gray
in particular. There's also some gold on Divebomb, but it's considerably
less than on the Dinobots', being only a few paint apps on the talons,
beak, and robot face. It still looks good as an acccent color, though.
I'm actually glad there's more metallic blue on the toy instead (painted
on both sides of his wings), which looks better in large amounts than this
shade of pale gold would have and also contrasts against the red and gray
quite well, too. There's also just a titch of black, but it doesn't really
contribute to the color scheme, given that it's used so little. Same with
the color of Divebomb's crossbow weapon, which is a goldish shade of tan
that Hasbro tends to use for "gold" plastic, though this shade doesn't
have any metallic shine to it.

     Beast Hunters Divebomb
is an okay "Dinobot-lite" homage, but with all that boring light milky
gray he's my least favorite release of this mold, despite the nice contrast
colors. Add all this to the fact that he's pretty difficult to find-- only
coming out in Europe and the usual Asian markets, having skipped the U.S.
entirely-- and I'd only recommend tracking this down if you're a Dinobot-homage
completist or a Prime Predacon mold completist (of which I am the latter).
