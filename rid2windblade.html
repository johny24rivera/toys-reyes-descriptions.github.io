    The RID2015 version of
Windblade borrows heavily from her initial
    <a href="windblade.html">
     Generations
    </a>
    version, with her alt mode being a fairly slim-looking VTOL jet. In general,
this is a pretty good alt mode, at least when looked at from the top. The
proportions are mostly good (again, from a top-down view), with the sole
exception being that the wings could have been just a titch larger overall.
She's got unique blade "swoops" on the end of her wings-- which, of course,
fits her name perfectly. Her VTOL fans can rotate in place, and even the
fanblades are separate pieces and can rotate around if you really dig a
fingernail in there. The nosecone looks great and semi-futuristic, with
several angular details around the cockpit window-- she also has some intake
vent details on the sides of her cockpit, and she does have a flip-down
landing gear underneath. The back portion of this mode is, relatively speaking,
the weakest; it's generally solid-looking, but the robot hands are VERY
clearly sticking out from behind the wings, and her feet are fairly obvious
on the back end of this mode, with no real "thruster" details back there
either. The extra little wings on the top are odd, but help add to her
uniqueness. From a side view the arms are even more obvious-- they don't
really fit in with the shape of the jet at all, folks, though at least
they peg in solidly-- and you can see Windblade's chest dipping down a
bit obviously. Somewhat less obviously are the interior leg portions below
her back third or so in this mode. For mold detailing, beyond the aforementioned
details on the cockpit, she's fairly sparse, as is the norm for RID2015
figures. She has some neat vent detailing near where her wings meet the
main body, some surprisingly intricate little tubing details underneath
said wings, and some basic line details on her smaller wings; otherwise
she has a pretty angular, but sparsely detailed, look to her. For a color
scheme, Windblade is mostly a pretty eye-catching cherry red on her nosecone
and wings, and black on her rear third or so. It roughly flips the amounts
of the colors from her original Generations figure, with red now being
the more dominant of the two colors-- which is fine with me, particularly
with this great shade. On the sides of her rear black-colored section,
it's oddly broken up between "pure" black and a more charcoally black--
it's a bit of an odd mismatch. Keeping it all "pure" black would've looked
better, in my opinion. There's red paint on the sides of this back portion,
but it's much, MUCH darker and duller than her red plastic-- it honestly
looks kinda bad. Either use a shade of red closer to her plastic or leave
it black, Hasbro. There's also some charcoally, semi-metallic black paint
on her cockpit windows and her VTOL fans, as well as some silver on her
nosecone and a really nice light blue shade of paint on what becomes her
robot kneecaps. This last bit in particular goes great against all the
other colors; I wish it was used more. Her wings could use a bit more paint,
but otherwise she's adequate in this mode in this respect. One last thing
worth mentioning about this mode is Windblade's sword and holster weapon,
which in this mode peg in between her legs underneath the bulk of the jet.
It doesn't really hide it very well, though; it's so large it unbalances
the entire mode (nothing else-- not even the landing gear wheels-- now
reach down to the ground), and it really looks awkward sticking out down
there. Unfortunately there's no other place to put it, so you're stuck
with either this huge bulky piece below her jet mode that unbalances the
whole thing or leaving the sword accessory somewhere else.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    The transformation to
Windblade's robot mode is fairly simple; fold back the wings some, rotate
her back section around and unfold it to become the feet and rotate up
the legs; then fold up the long skinny piece containing her tailfins onto
her back, and fold the nosecone onto her back as well, revealing her robot
head. You can peg in her sword holster into the little slot on her hip
balljoint, though unfortunately it comes off just as easily as the original
Generations version's sword holster, also located there; it's just not
a deep enough peg to adequately hold that big of an accessory. Thankfully,
coming out of her holster is a pretty cool-detailed sword, with a mini
"VTOL engine" detail on the sword's handle like on the original and a very
sweeping look to the blade. (Unfortunately, it's completely black with
no paint whatsoever-- a real shame, as the VTOL engine detailing in particular
could've used some light blue or something.) The "core" proportions of
Windblade are pretty good in this mode, with relatively skinny arms with
sharp, stylized shoulder pads and fairly delicate-looking hands; a skinny
waist; and larger, longer legs with a little more bulk in the hips and
definitely more in the feet than in the knees. Her chest has a fairly skinny
stomach with a chest that looks like it has armor over it. Her headsculpt
is aces, with a collar around the neck joint, little red details underneath
her blue eyes on her white face (with red lips), and some charcoal black
hair. She also has a yellow-painted removable "hair comb", which she can
hold in a hand... though why you would want to do that, I'm not sure. The
rest of her head is red, though, which I'm not crazy about-- given how
most of the rest of her head should be the equivalent of "hair" keeping
it cherry red looks weird, here. Still, she's got a nice "sure of herself"
expression on her face, which definitely fits her RID2015 persona. Like
the other versions of Windblade, she does have her wings just hanging off
her back, which in some instances can enhance her silhouette a bit, but
I wish could at least retract a bit so they weren't so large proportionally.
Her nosecone sticking off her back is a bit more obnoxious of a vehicle
mode extra, as it's quite large, especially at the top where it has to
easily fit over Windblade's entire ornately-detailed head. The wing piece
also sticks out a bit behind her hips, which is a minor eyesore. For paint
specific to this mode, beyond the paint on her face already discussed,
she has some more of that really nice light blue on the sides of her chest
panels; silver on her stomach/abs; some semi-metallic charcoal black on
the pieces that form her hips (but oddly not on the pieces that form the
lower portions of her legs); aaaand that's it. Still, given how much detailing
is shared between this mode and her jet mode, her colors are still broken
up fairly well in most instances. (As mentioned earlier, though, her weapon
still desperately needs some paint, and her arms/shoulders could've used
some as well.) For articulation, Windblade can move at the neck, shoulders,
elbows (at two points), waist rotation, and movement at the hips (at two
points), knees (at two points), and a bit back-and-forth at the ankles.
She's a bit backheavy so this inhibits her articulation some, but otherwise
she's pretty mobile, overall.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Although the design
still has its definite weaknesses (obvious hands in alt mode, an overly
clunky weapon acccessory, wings and some other obvious kibble in robot
mode), overall this is a definite improvement over Windblade's original
Generations design. The stylized jet mode looks generally more solid and
less "fragile-looking", and I love the blades on the ends of her wings.
In robot mode the improvement is the biggest, with much better proportions
and a better ability to stand up and pose than her Generations predecessor.
Mildly recommended, though in my opinion, if you only get one version of
her RID2015 version I'd make it the slightly-improved Combiner Force variant--
but this is a good "silver" if you can't find that version for a decent
price...
