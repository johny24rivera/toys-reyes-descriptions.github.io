    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original SWTF Clone
Pilot/Trooper. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original SWTF Clone Pilot/Trooper

     The remold of the Clone
Pilot/Trooper mold is, quite honestly, the first Star Wars Transformer
that will really catch your eye right on the aisle pegs. All of the other
Star Wars Transformers have had fairly dull color schemes, necessitated
by the need to be accurate to their movie colors. It's obvious they had
fun with this one-- the vehicle mode has been painted to look like a tiger
shark! A typical military style "shark face" has been painted on the front,
while dark greenish blue tiger shark "stripes" and "gills" have been painted
all over the wings and the top of the main body of the vehicle mode. The
off-white is still the dominant color on the main body, just as it was
on the original use of this mold, but there's enough stylized color variation
to make up for this. The black and bits of red also contrast really well
with the off-white and dark blue-green, as well.

     There are two mold changes
made to this version of the Clone Pilot mold-- the most noticeable is that
the Mech mode head has been changed to resemble a Clone Commander more
than a Clone Pilot (or so I've been told, at least)-- and, an increase
in the "rank" of the toy aside, I think that head design looks better than
the one on the first Clone Pilot. Also, the miniature figure that fits
inside the cockpit has been appropriately changed to a Clone Commander
figure, as well.

     This new version of
the Clone Pilot mold has a really snazzy color scheme that catches your
eye very quickly among the other Star Wars TFs. The remolds also make the
mold look a little better in robot mode, as well. Although it's not for
everyone-- some might prefer a more realistic color scheme on a Star Wars
vehicle-- I think this one surpasses the original release of the mold in
everyway-- one of the best Star Wars Transformers $15 toys, in my opinion.

       This skilled pilot is part of the Republic's
most elite military force. Using a cutting-edge morphing technology developed
during the Clone Wars, he is able to engage his enemies on the ground,
then quickly morph into ARC-170 mode and bring the battle into space.

       It should be noted, however, that the Mech mode pic is slightly mistransformed--
the shoulders should be slid farther up on the main body, and the legs
should be extended out a bit more.)
