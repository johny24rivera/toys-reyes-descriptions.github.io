    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Legends
class Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original RotF Legends class Optimus Prime

     ...Oh, c'mon now, Hasbro.
I get that you want to cut costs where possible, but... geez. Optimus hasn't
had this design for TWO MOVIES now, and it's not like you can easily confuse
this design with his previous, as you can with a similarly-sized toy of
Bumblebee. Still, what's worse than re-using this Legends design again
is just comparing it to the original version in terms of paint apps. Seriously,
just look at the review linked to of this mold and compare it to the pics
above. SO MUCH PAINT and color variation is now missing. Optimus Prime
is now almost entirely dark milky blue in both modes-- though to be fair,
it's a rather nice shade of dark milky blue plastic. There's certainly
worse colors to dominate a Legends-class figure. There's a bit of black
plastic on the wheels and upper arms, as well as the waist, but the blue
is dark enough the black doesn't really contrast much against the dominant
color. There is some nice silver paint on the truck grill, truck windows,
and robot face, and some small dark red flame paint apps on the rear portion
of the front hood and on the sides (though it should be noted the flames
actually go THROUGH the side door details-- nice attention to detail there,
Hasbro). There's also a dark red Autobot symbol on the left leg, which,
like the flames, is a bit too dark to adequately contrast against the blue
plastic. Aaand that's it as far as color variety and paint apps on this
toy. No paint apps on the back end/arms at all, smokestacks unpainted,
side bits unpainted, much of the robot details unpainted... just all dark
blue plastic. Another reason Hasbro needed to make a new mold-- if you
have to take off this many paint apps just to meet the budget, perhaps
you should make a toy that wasn't so costly (relatively, of course).

     Surprisingly, mold changes
HAVE been made to this version of Optimus Prime, but they were cost-cutting
mold changes; the wheels now connect via clips, not pins. The peg that
connects the legs together is also longer, for some reason.

     TLK legion Optimus Prime
is just a sub-par release in every aspect except the mold itself. The toy
itself is actually okay for the size, but it's completely inaccurate to
the TLK movie, and it doesn't have the "exclusive" excuse like some other
redecoes. The lack of paint beyond the front grill and around the windows
is also just really a downer, especially when you compare this toy to its
original version. Only recommended if you want a small toy of Movie 1-3
Optimus and can't find a better-painted prior version.
