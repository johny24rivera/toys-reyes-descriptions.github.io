    Beast mode is a Transmetal
2 hyena. This is definitely the best Maximal Transmetal 2 beast mode I've
seen yet. The detailing on this toy is superb, with wires, blades, and
fur everywhere. One of the nicest features of this beast mode is the chainsaw
blade on Jawbreaker's back. It has a lever that you can push and make it
spin! There are spikes everywhere in this mode, and this makes this Maximal
look like one slicing 'n dicing machine. The only problem I have with this
mode, however, is that you can see the robot chest and head easily from
just about any viewpoint except the one shown above and if you look at
him from directly above. This body part doesn't really lock in place, and
if it is a little loose on the toy you have, it can flop around very easily.

    Before I go on to the robot mode, there
is something worth noting. While it is somewhat easy to transform the toy
from beast mode to robot mode, it is VERY frustrating and annoying transforming
him back to beast mode. Transform at your own risk!

    Robot mode is a disapointment
when compared with the beast mode, however. There are few extras, but these
extras are big and get in the way. The front two hyena legs fold up into
themselves, but are still big obstructions on Jawbreaker's arms and tend
to get in the way- a LOT. They just don't look right- they're two close
to the elbows to be shoulder armor, and they're too far away from the arms
to be used as any kind of weapons. Another downside to this mode is the
right robot arm- it's Jawbreaker's hyena head. It looks odd where it is,
and this arm looks too bulky when compared to Jawbreaker's left, normal
arm. (By the way, the spark orb is on the right side of the hyena arm.)
Jawbreaker's legs are oddly jointed as well, and it's hard to position
them exactly straight. There are a few good points about this mode, however.
The sword that Jawbreaker holds in his left arm is very big and has several
blades on it. This could quite possibly be the biggest deluxe Beast Warrior
weapon EVER. The detail on Jawbreaker's robot face is nice as well, and
has a cyborg look to it, like

    Beast mode on the transformer
is very nice, but Hasbro could have done a little better on the robot mode.

      The most aggressive of the Maximals,
Jawbreaker never backs down from a fight. Prefers combat situations where
odds are stacked against him. Most effective in close-combat battle, where
his powerful jaws can be devastating. Utilizes magnetic field generator
between his shoulders, drawing unfortunate Predacons into his spinning
deltoid blade. Possesses a twisted sense of humor; laughs a lot - but generally
laughs alone.

      (NOTE: Jawbreaker was originally named Cackle. I, personally, prefer
the old name, since the name "Jawbreaker" sounds more like something you
put in your mouth than something you fear.)
