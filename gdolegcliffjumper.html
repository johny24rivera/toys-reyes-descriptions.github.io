    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the "G1" Universe 2.0 Legends
class Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the "G1" Universe 2.0 Legends class Bumblebee toy

     I'm honestly surprised
it took this many releases of this mold to finally get a redeco of it as
Cliffjumper. By and large, this Cliffjumper redeco follows all the basic
Cliffjumper rules-- he's mostly black and red, with a bit of silver. The
red is of a particularly eye-catching shade of the color, and is a bit
darker than the reds usually used on Cliffjumper toys. This means that,
between the red and the black, there isn't as much as contrast as usual.
That said, the whole red/black scheme was never particularly original (or
exclusive to Cliffjumper) to begin with, and it still looks good. What
helps the mold "pop"-- particularly in vehicle mode-- is the silver. Used
on the headlights, windows (including the rear window, hurrah!), and face,
it really contrasts excellently with all that dark red. Putting silver
around the red Autobot symbol on the roof/chest was also a smart choice
to make the allegiance symbol pop, as well. There's also just a touch of
light metallic blue used on the eyes, which is a really nice shade to the
point where I wish it had been used a bit more on the toy (perhaps on the
headlights instead of silver, for instance).

     No mold changes have
been made to this version of Cliffjumper.

     The legion class "Dollar
Store" release of Cliffjumper is a solid recolor-- and finally, a usage
of this mold that isn't a Bumblebee variant! The color scheme plays it
by the book for the most part, with the only real difference from the norm
being Cliffjumper's red being slightly darker than usual. Thus this toy
isn't full of surprises, but that's okay-- it's still a good color scheme
on a pretty decent Legion class toy, and it fills in a gap that may have
been missing for many Legion/Legends class fans.
