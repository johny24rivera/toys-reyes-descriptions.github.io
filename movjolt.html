    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Crosswise. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Crosswise

     Originally intended to
be an homage to the G1 Micromaster Roadhugger, the name apparently wasn't
available, so the design team reused the name "Jolt" again. Homage or not,
Jolt works very well regardless. Purple is always a good color for a Decepticon,
and this toy is no exception-- the silver stripes and detailing in robot
mode looks ESPECIALLY awesome, and the black and gray make nice secondary
colors as well. It's a bit of a reversal over the "traditional black Decepticon"
colors where black and silver are the main colors, with purple being more
of a secondary color. The dark red used for the headlights and robot headlights
(pun intended) also works nice as an accent color. Overall, the only thing
I'm not totally sold on regarding Jolt's color scheme is the particular
shade of purple used for his transparent parts-- it's really dull, and
not obviously "purple" enough on the windows-- only the "exhaust" missile
really looks purple. Using a brighter purple would have worked better,
me thinks.

     No mold changes have
been made to Movie Jolt, though he does have a "standard" Decepticon Cyber
Key in place of the mold's earlier releases with an Earth Cyber Key.

     Overall, Movie Jolt
is a great-looking repaint-- purple and silver go together extremely well,
especially on a sleek-looking car. The accent colors just make it look
all the more awesome, homage or not. Recommended the most of any of this
mold's uses.

       Shortly after the final battle for the
Allspark, Jolt sought out Barricade for advice. Brought to life by the
energy bursts thrown off the Allspark during the fight, he wanted to learn
the finer points of lying and trashing stuff. After Barricade was done
beating on him, Decepticon Frenzy made fun of him for a while, and slashed
his tires. That was his first, and only, lesson, and he took it to heart.
