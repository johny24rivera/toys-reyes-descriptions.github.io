    Like most of the other
Scout class Cyberverse toys, Starscream's alternate mode is a sort of "partial
transform" between vehicle and robot mode. Basically, Starscream's "alt
mode" is a jet with the back half missing and instead with robot legs.
It's difficult to tell what exactly are supposed to be robot mode "extras"
in this mode-- the legs are obviously supposed to be visible-- but I'm
guessing the circular rotation pieces and the bits of robot chest framing
the sides of the cockpit shouldn't be quite so obvious. The jet portion's
body is pretty proportional, fitting in nicely with the Cyberverse aesthetic
with more basic, friendly detailing that is somewhere between "mainline"
and "Rescue Bots" complexity. There's some angles and ridges here and there,
such as on the intake vents, and the cockpit is nice and stylized. The
wings are a titch undersized and swoop back a fair amount instead of out
as much as you'd expect, but this works well with the gimmick and is somewhat
accurate to the show, so make of that what you will. The guns in front
of said wings give Starscream some firepower in this "mode". The legs are
pretty straightforward-- they're rather angular, being larger at the bottom
than at the knees, while the relatively small upper legs are tabbed in
at an angle in this mode to keep Starscream stable, since if you moved
them back to where they connect to his waist he'd fall forward. The colors
are pretty Starscreamy-- he's got some fairly light, milky gray plastic
used for most of the jet mode portions, which is a rather bland but certainly
accurate. His robot legs take a slight departure and are more aquamarine
than dark blue, and I honestly like the change-- it still contrasts with
the gray nicely enough, but is more unique. There's some red curved stripes
on the wings, as well as a bit around his cockpit, while the cockpit itself
has orange paint and the nosecone has a "charcoal" impure shade of black
used for it. There's also a Decepticon symbol on each wing, natch. All
in all the color scheme is quite varied for such a small toy, even if I'm
not a fan of the gray. The legs contain Starscream's only real point of
articulation in this mode-- at the knees, both legs can move forward one
"click", but only one-- they can't move forward much. Instead, they serve
as a "handle" of sorts for the gimmick in this mode-- move the legs as
a whole forward and back at the waist, and the wings will spin around.
Unfortunately, it's rather easily to accidentally mess up the rotation
with your fingers and get the wings off in terms of them rotating in unison,
though you can fix this easily by just repositioning them. It's kind of
a weird gimmick, but honestly kind of fun too. The wings do kinda dangle
there in this mode, but in robot mode they stay put, so they're not annoying.

    To transform Starscream
into his robot mode, just fold the legs down, rotate the arms out from
the sides (they do thankfully have pegs in the other mode to keep them
secure), then fold down the cockpit to become the chest and you're done.
The chest is a bit wide, with the biggest issue here being that the arms
are actually kinda "detached" from the body visually because of the transformation.
The head is also a little undersized-- or the chest oversized, take your
pick. Having the cockpit nosecone also not fold into the body at all doesn't
look all that great, either, and for a toy this small the gap between the
front and back of the body is noticeable. Obviously given that Starscream
is a "partial" Transformer, much of what's visible in the other mode is
visible in this mode, so the legs and wings still look good. What's new
really is just the arms and head. The arms are a bit undersized, and the
upper arms in particular are too square at the shoulders and then too skinny
around the elbows. The robot head is pretty accurate, though, taking Screamer's
traditional head design and making the sides more angular and the face
a bit skinnier, as befits his character. His smirking face is painted silver
and his eyes red, while the rest of the head is charcoal black. There's
also a bit of red paint on the shoulders, though the rest of the arms are
aquamarine-- a nice color, but not accurate to the show. With so many details
shared from the other mode, this means Starscream still retains a pretty
good, varied color palette in this mode. Beyond the slight knee articulation
already talked about, Starscream also has ball joints at his hips and shoulders
in this mode for movement.

    As with many Scout-class
Cyberverse toys, whether I'd recommend this version of Starscream depends
on how much you're up for a "partial-former". If you like the idea of a
legged "gerwalk" jet mode with spinny-wings, then the robot mode is good
enough where I'd say go for it, at the cheap price. If not, buy one of
the larger toys of him instead (though preferably not the original Warrior...).
