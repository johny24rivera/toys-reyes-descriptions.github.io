    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Beast Machines Deluxe Jetstorm.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Beast Machines Deluxe
Jetstorm

     The fifth (!) iteration
of the Beast Machines Deluxe Jetstorm mold, Skywarp, is most decidedly
the best. For one, he doesn't have the "sticky, flimsy arms" problem that
     <a href="stormjet.html">

     </a>
     and
     <a href="jhiaxus.html">

     had; and secondly, his paint job just freaking rocks. Black and purple
have always been a favorite color scheme of mine, and Hasbro just made
it even more awesome with all these added paint apps. The gray, used as
a secondary color as it is, mixes well with the black and purple; the silver
just rocks all around; and the orange makes a VERY nice contrasting color
in the back, while keeping this toy from being "just another black repaint".
There's also a few colors- white, yellow- and dark gray- that are used
on just one or two places, giving you the impression that extra care was
put into this repaint to give it all that more pizazz. (Although yes, Skywarp's
spark crystal just has a Decepticon symbol painted over it, like the other
Universe figures.) I have no complaints whatsoever about the paint job-
it's just that good, and a great homage to G1

     Universe Skywarp is
a great mold with an outstanding paint job. Although the mold does need
to retire after this toy- after all, this is its fifth color scheme- it
does make a great Skywarp. Mildly recommended if you have a previous version
of this mold; otherwise, highly recommended.
