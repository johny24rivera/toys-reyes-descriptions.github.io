     Of all the Iron Man 2
"Concept Series" Transformer Crossovers, this version is the only one that
sports remolding. Instead of Cap's shield that doubles as a "spare tire"
in vehicle mode, Iron Man has a roof-mounted machine gun weapon that can
pivot from side-to-side, and which can also be held in mech mode. In addition
to this, the piece on top of the chest has Iron Man's signature triangular
"power core" design, as opposed to Captain America's patriotic star (the
stars still exist in the middle of the wheel spokes, however, as a faint
hint at who this mold orignally was). The head mold has, of course, also
been changed to Iron Man's, but what's odd is that it seems to have been
carried
     <i>
      straight
     </i>
     over from the
     <a href="ironmantf.html">
      original
Iron Man jet mold
     </a>
     . Normally that wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing,
but on this mold it looks too small-- it should have been changed slightly
proportionally to fit in better. As for the color scheme, it's what you'd
expect from an Iron Man toy-- primarily red and yellow, with a bit of white
and black to serve as accent colors. I'm still not fond of how "primary"
that yellow is-- I wish it was a bit duller, more golden of a shade. The
red is darker than on most of the earlier Iron Man TF Crossover toys, though,
which I consider a plus. The metallic gunmetal gray used for painting the
windows is also a pretty nice, fitting shade and contrasts quite well with
the surrounding red. I'm not sure why light red paint apps were wasted
on the taillights, however-- it almost completely blends in with the red
plastic, and I would've preferred some more gray or white detailing on
the vehicle mode, which desperately needs some paint on the armor paneling.

     The humvee Iron Man
remold works surprisingly well for the character, and the new weapon is
pretty cool (though not quite as cool as Cap's shield). The new head is
definitely out-of-proportion with the red of the body, however, and though
you get a pretty big toy for your money, it really needs some more paint
apps in vehicle mode. I'd recommend this version of the mold
     <i>
      slightly
     </i>
     over Captain America, if only because the colors fit together better on
the vehicle mode here.

       In the rugged, untracked mountains,
air power is almost useless. Enemies can hide in caves, or beneath dense
tree cover. That's why Iron Man developed this tough, converting suit of
armor with full off-road capabilities and repulsor-strength horsepower.
When he's hunting bad guys in the wildest places on the planet, this is
the armor Iron Man brings.
