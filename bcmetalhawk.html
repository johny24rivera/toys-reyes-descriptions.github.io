    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Thunderwing.

     Metalhawk here is certainly
something that wouldn't see mass-release, being a full-blown human "Pretender"--
without any actual "real inner robot", given that like all Botcon toys
he's a remold and not a new toy that could take advantage of that gimmick.
However, the jet mode is a little reminiscient of the original toy's inner
robot's alt mode, so there's that. Metalhawk's color scheme is pretty basic
for the most part, and also very primary-- white, a light red, and dark
blue are used as his main colors. These patriotic colors go together fairly
well, though perhaps adding a bit of gold here and there as an additional
accent color would've helped him look a bit more varied. He certainly does
have many paint apps, but nearly all of them are of roughly the same white/red/blue
hues as his plastic-- along with some silver for good measure. In robot
mode is where all his paint apps really come together, with some pretty
extensive detailing on his legs and chest, in particular, to help emulate
his original toy's color layout. It's a pretty impressive job all-around,
and works well on Metalhawk given that the original release of this mold
was also modeled after a human-esque Pretender.

     Metalhawk has a new
head sculpt, but it's certainly one that's going to be polarizing-- it's
made to resemble his Pretender "fake human" head, as opposed to his inner
robot's! Thus, unless you know the backstory, he really does look like
a human in extensive armor in robot mode, as opposed to an actual robot.
Given the lack of his "real" head, this may disappoint some folks, but
for something aimed at a rather niche audience I think it works, and the
sculpting itself is fairly accurate, so no complaints there.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Metalhawk certainly
isn't for everyone-- his color scheme is neither outrageously kitschy neon
or anything approaching realistic, and his head is a human head. That said,
the idea was a pretty solid one, and in robot mode in particular it works
well with the mold. I wish his color scheme was slightly less primary,
but then again it IS, of course, accurate to the original toy this way.
I still think the

     release of
this mold is the best, however.

       Cool and calm, Metalhawk has earned
his position as leader of the Pretenders. Refusing to bow to any pressure
by making rash decisions, Metalhawk believes in formality. There is a way
of doing things and he sticks to those methods without question. During
the war, he witnessed many commanders make snap judgments, causing them
to lose thier lives and those of the bots under their command. Stationed
aboard the Skyhammer above Japan, he has gained the respect of Crossblades,
Vroom and Skyhammer's pilot. He is able to say the right thing to them
in times of trouble, which usually results in them getting out of a tight
situation.

       Metalhawk serves as the liaison between
Earthlings and the Autobots. The nose of his jet mode can become a separate,
aerial drone while the two missile launchers can detach as individual weapons
or join together to make a larger gun.
