    Like the other Prime
Master figures, Micronus Prime doesn't really look anything like how he's
traditionally looked (beyond being humanoid of course); he's been traditionally
presented as a little, fairly chubby Mini-Con guy, but for Titan Master
cross-compatibility he shares the same proportions and transformation as
all the other Titan &amp; Prime Masters. In robot mode, Micronus is pretty
darned generic overall. He's got your typical fists molded into the arms,
fairly bland rectangles for his feet, and a fairly normal-looking head,
with a "normal" face and a square helmet surrounding said face. There's
a central vent-like detail on the chest, but that's about as unique as
Micronus gets, here. His color scheme is mostly red and dark gray, which
isn't an amazing color scheme but does the job, with the colors contrasting
against each other fairly well. There's a bit of periwinkle paint on the
face, which looks particularly good against the red, but isn't otherwise
used on Micronus. Like all other Prime/Titan Masters, in this mode Micronus
can move at the neck, as well as back-and-forth at the shoulders, hips,
and knees (the latter two as one for both legs, since the legs are molded
together). In his Prime core mode, Micronus is sort of "symbolic", and
is used in combination with Prime Armor pieces or other PotP toys to "power
them up", at least figuratively. Micronus' symbol looks kind of like a
cycloptic jester, really, complete with what looks like a mouth. What it
actually is, of course, is meant to be emblematic of the chest of a TF
with the arms out to the sides and power emanating from the circle in the
center, which shows how Mini-Cons (of which Micronus is supposedly the
first) power-up the TFs they link to. There's a couple of angular decorative
details around the emblem, but given that the emblem itself is painted
a pale gold, these are definitely just decorations around the symbol and
not part of the symbol itself.

    To add to the Prime
Masters, instead of accessory sets they come with a "Pretender shell" homage.
Micronus is paired with/can fit in a Cloudburst shell, which was your typical
"human in armor" Pretender in G1. From a front view he's replicated pretty
well here, with a dome head, fairly curvy proportions with some angular
details on the chest, and a nice "belt" on the waist. He's got the same
red and dark gray plastic colors from Micronus, with the addition of more
periwinkle on the helmet, chest, and waist. There's also sone off-white
paint on the chest and upper legs. From the side you can see that, beyond
the front part that opens up, it's mostly one piece in the back, minus
the arms which can move forward-and-back (that's all the articulation in
this mode, sadly). Pretty much the entire back portion is dark gray. Cloudburst
has a two-pronged red rotary gun with off-white paint that he can either
hold in one of his hands, or that you can clip on and fold onto his back
in this mode. As with all Prime Master "Pretender" accessories, if you
fold the weapon on his back forward and then fold out a peg that's between
the Pretender shell feet, this forms the weapon mode-- which, given the
weapon, is basically a larger dual-pronged rotary gun. You can peg in Micronus
(or another Prime Master) in the back to "power" the gun mode if you so
wish. There's some nice details on the back, like some circular and vent-like
details, but this is definitely an afterthought of a mode, like all the
Prime Master weapon modes. I mean, you've just got the whole Pretender
shell right there behind the front, arms most obvious/egregious. Still,
it does give the small toy some way to interact with larger PotP toys.

    PotP "Prime Master sets"
are largely the same in terms of playability and proportions/gimmick, so
ultimately whether one's better than the other comes down to the color
scheme and the weapon. Micronus' dual rotary gun is a pretty neat weapon
for the front, and the red/blue/gray/perwinkle color scheme is decent,
albeit not mind-blowing. The Pretender shell look itself is a bit bland
in terms of just looking like a humanoid spacesuit, and Micronus' symbol
is decent but nothing special. Still, overall a slightly above-average
Prime Master set.
