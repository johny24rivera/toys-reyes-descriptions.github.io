    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Thundercracker.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron
Thundercracker

     For a change of pace,
Thundercracker is now repainted as Starscream! It makes for a fairly convincing
Starscream nonetheless, even though the mold was originally designed for
a completely different character. The traditional gray/blue/red color scheme
that Starscream's almost always had is, as expected, present on this Legends
class figure, but there's a few tweaks to the colors that really make them
stand out, in my opinion. For one, Starscream usually has a rather bland
shade of gray for his main color, but this time around it's a milky brownish
shade of gray, which actually works striking well with the other colors,
particularly the blue. And speaking of the blue, there's more of it than
usual on Starscream, which I think it is a good thing. There's also less
red (again, a good thing), being used only for the traditional stripes
in jet mode. Starscrean still retains his orange cockpit and black headcrest,
though, to help increase the "Hey, it's Starscream!" value of the toy.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Universe 2.0 G1 Legend
class Starscream (Egads, that's a lot of prefixes!) is a mighty fine repaint,
even if it's of a rather mediocre mold, with a nice twist on Starscream's
classic color scheme. He's tied with Universe 2.0 Legend class
     <a href="specialteamleaders.html">
      Silverbolt

     as my favorite version of this mold. If you like Legends class figures
and don't mind repaints/don't have this mold yet, by all means pick this
bad boy up.
