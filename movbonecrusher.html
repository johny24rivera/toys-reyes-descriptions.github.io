    Bonecrusher's vehicle
mode is something that's never been done before-- a Buffalo minesweeper
vehicle (that's what the fork-like arm in the front is for). It's always
great to see new vehicle modes being used, and Bonecrusher's alt mode looks
pretty darned solid. The robot feet are a TAD obvious on the underside
of the rear portion of the vehicle, given that they don't quite match up
with the underside of the front portion of the vehicle, but that's a minor
quibble. Other than that, there's no robot extras whatsoever in this mode,
and the proportions are spot-on accurate. There's also TONS of mold detailing,
though the paint detailing is oddly rather lacking for some reason. The
color scheme itself of various shades of tan, green, and black is a little
dull, but the Movie aesthetic is realism over slick looks, and the tan
colors certainly fit this mode very well, so what would normally be a complaint
over the colors isn't one regarding this toy. The minesweeper arm can also
move from one side of the vehicle to the center to deploy it outwards,
to either sweep for some mines or just spike some annoying Autobots. The
arm itself can move at seven different points, in fact, so you can get
it into a lot of different positions.

    Bonecrusher's robot
mode is also incredibly awesome. It's got LOADS of personality, due its
quirky gimmicks and odd proportions and face design. His head is pretty
small in comparison to his body, with no discernable mouth, and looks like
a cross between an owl and some sort of insect. His arms are also very
long proportionally, and they can be made even longer by folding out his
lower arms into a super-freaking-long arm configuration, as is shown on
his right arm in the picture above. His legs are also rather short, with
wheels on the bottoms to let him pseudo-skate like in the movie. Surprisingly,
his toes prevent the wheels from turning so much on their own that they
make him unstable-- definite kudos to the designers for preventing that.
All this comes together to definitely makes him look like the tough Decepticon
grunt he's supposed to be. What's especially cool about this mode, however,
is Bonecrusher's "scorpion tail" made out of the minesweeper arm of his
vehicle mode-- it's incredibly inventive and just too freakin' cool. Plus,
it can fold out of the way if you don't want it deployed. Bonecrusher also
has great articulation-- he can move at the head, shoulders (at two points),
knees (at two points), six points on his "tail", the hips (at two points),
the knees, and his front toes. He also has an additional three points on
each of his extendo-arms, so you can get a ton of awesome poses out of
this freak. The only thing I don't like about this mode-- and it's a pretty
minor complaint-- is that a few parts of his vehicle mode just hang off
his lower arms without looking like anything. I mean, Bonecrusher has a
few other obvious vehicle pieces in this mode, like the wheels on his shoulders,
but they complement the look instead of subtract with it and at least fit
in with the overall shape of the toy. Those lower arm plates don't.

    Bonecrusher is an incredible,
unique figure in both modes, with almost no downsides whatsoever, and he's
quite playable as well. One of my favorite movie toys-- HIGHLY recommended!

      Bonecrusher hates everything, and what
Bonecrusher hates, he destroys. He hates this planet, and all its inhabitants.
He hates the Autobots for getting in his way. He ever hates Megatron and
the other Decepticons; the only reason he stays with them is because Megatron
scares him. Bonecrusher lives for the day when he's the only one left standing
atop a pile of smoking rubble and shattered robots.

      (NOTE: Bonecrusher was also released in a Target Exclusive 2-pack entitled
"Freeway Brawl" with
      <a href="movvoyprime.html">
       Voyager class Optimus
      </a>
      .
However, even though Voyager Optimus was changed slightly, that release
of him was the exact same as the initial version.)
