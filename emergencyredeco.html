       This time around, Firebot
has a color scheme that is definitely a throwback to Generation One Hot
Spot, a combiner fire truck with almost the same color scheme, at least
in vehicle mode. Overall, it looks very nice on Firebot. The red is a shade
or two too bright to be ideal, but it's not that big of a problem. Also,
Firebot could use a little more paint detailing on the top in vehicle mode,
but otherwise he looks pretty nice. However, although I do appreciate the
fan nod, this kind of light blue just isn't quite as fitting for a fire
truck as red is, which is why the original Firebot pulls ahead oh-so-slightly
of this version.

         Makeshift has a blue-and-red
color scheme this time, with a bit of black and yellow thrown in for good
measure. It's not a BAD color scheme, persay, it just could be better.
The red and blue don't really mix well together, which is very odd considering
that they usually do. I guess it's just because that's pretty much all
there is, or maybe it's because the red is a little bit too bright... I
do like the yellow highlights on the weapon mode, though. They contrast
very nicely with the blue. Still, I'd have to say I like Makeshift's original
scheme noticeably better.

           My comments on this version
of Armada Prowl are pretty much as they were for Makeshift. It's not a
bad color scheme, but the red and blue don't quite match up, and I liked
the older version of Armada Prowl slightly better. (Although at least most
of his body and legs aren't made up of transparent plastic this time around...)
I really like the silver and gold paint detailing that they put on Prowl,
though. It looks really spiffy on the red and blue. Oh, and don't forget
that this is yet another Generation One fan nod- this time it's to the
original Smokescreen, given that he had the same sportscarsy alt mode,
the same general color scheme, and the number "38" on his hood. Pretty
cool, there.

            Overall, I'd have to
recommend the original Emergency Team over their redecoed version. Although
the color schemes certainly aren't bad at all on these Minicons, all three
of them are a slight step below their previous versions. Still, if you
like Minicons or just enjoy the Generation One throwbacks, it's worth picking
up.
