    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Activator
Lockdown. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Bandit Lockdown isn't
just a random redeco, he's a bit of an homage to

     . The kooky skeleton graffiti paint apps in vehicle mode
are the main clue-- and may I just say they look awesome?-- and in robot
mode, he also has his left optic "blacked out" by a paint app so as to
make it sorta look like an eye patch or injury. They're great touches on
a repaint, and gives it that extra amount of inherent personality to make
it pop. Lockdown still keeps his trademark black for most of his plastic
parts, but the other main color is now a dark blue, which may not contrast
as well with the black as the original's light green did, but it still
looks good. Lockdown has plenty of lighter paint apps to help with contrast,
including a nice light red down his torso and some REALLY nice-looking
metallic greenish teal used for his windows-- this makes him look particularly
good in vehicle mode. He also some worn-looking rusty red on his chest
and part of his engine, as well as a very cool spray paint-app down the
front bumpers to make them look worn. His face and engine have also been
darkened somewhat from silver to a gunmetal gray, and it works given the
overall darker color scheme.

     No mold changes have
been made to Bandit Lockdown-- it still has a bit of a problem staying
together in vehicle mode, unfortunately.

     Bandit Lockdown is a
fantastic redeco, not only being an homage to one of the greatest repaints
ever but also just looking really interesting on his own with a worn, "pirate-y"
color scheme and some really nice paint apps, particularly in vehicle mode.
It's better than the original color scheme, and it's a shame this is on
the medicore-at-best Activator mold-- I'd have liked to see these colors

       Lockdown knows that if he can strike
fear into the Spark of his target, he has won the battle before it even
begins. That's the origin of his new paint job. He wants his prey to know
he's coming, and that there's nothing they can do to stop him.
