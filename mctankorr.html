    Vehicle mode is a cybertronian
tank. This mode is pretty nice and very show-accurate, especially for a
Happy Meal toy. The only rather odd parts about this mode is that, for
one, the large cannon is connected to Tankorr's head, not his shoulders,
so he can't move his head while keeping his cannon straight. Secondly,
Tankorr's robot arms are rather visible from the middle of his back tank
treads, as they're a different color then the surrounding plastic. Other
than that, though, this mode is well-done. There is plently of detailing
as well, both mold-wise and paint-wise. There are all sorts of mechanical
details etched into the chest and the sides of the treads, and this toy
has quite an array of colors for a Happy Meal toy. Tankorr's "sunglasses"
are painted quite well in this mode. Tankorr's allegiance symbol is visible
on a small transparent red orb in the middle of his chest.

    Although the transformation
to robot mode is very simple, it is rather effective and show-accurate
anyway. Even though this mode isn't quite as good as the vehicle mode,
it's still rather nice, considering the size of the toy. Tankorr's feet
are both simple and effective, although a bit small; basically, you just
fold them into two halves so that they resemble short legs and feet. His
chest is a bit large proportionally in this mode, however, and his arms
cannot extend all the way out. Small tabs only allow the lower arms to
come out halfway, which is rather odd- there is no need for those tabs
at all, and it would have made this mode a bit better to do without them.
There is also a telltale gap in the chest where a rod connected to Tankorr's
neck pivots during transformation. It's rather detracting from the mode,
and makes it more "toy-like". Still, the detailing and paint detailing
are still quite nice in this mode, as they were in the vehicle mode.

    A pretty-well done Happy
Meal toy; but again, it IS just a Happy Meal toy, and as such, it's small
and has limited playability. Still, this toy is my favorite of the Beast
Machines Happy Meal bunch, and I recommend it if you enjoy collecting the
little buggers.... and if you like McDonald's food, of course.
