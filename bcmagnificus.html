not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Perceptor.

     Magnificus is an updated
version of an earlier e-Hobby exclusive of the same name, who was also
a repaint (of the original) Perceptor. This version stays largely true
to "G1 Magnficus" in terms of having the classic "evil" color scheme of
black, gray, and red. The black is a pretty deep, pure black that looks
fairly nice, and the light red is also quite eye-popping, particularly
when it contrasts against the black. (That said, the front windows being
a transparent red means that they have a rather different shade of the
color than the windows that are merely painted.) The chrome also looks
pretty snazzy, being the accent color that it is on the lower arms and
chest. However, the light gray is the same dull milky shade that's used
on far too many Transformers nowadays, and the milky dull bluish gray could've
been a bit lighter to contrast with the black better-- honestly, it could've
just as well have been silver like many of his other paint apps. The sole
bit of light red plastic-- used for Magnificus' shoulder-mounted gun in
robot mode-- is a bit too pale for my liking as well. In vehicle mode,
Magnificus' license plate is a bit of nod to his bio, essentially spelling
out "Mebion", where he was a military affairs advisor.

     Magnificus has a new
head mold (not made specifically for this release, but made with the mold
and never released with it until now); it's based off of the
     <a href="g1perceptor.html">
      G1
Perceptor toy's

     faceplated head. It looks pretty well-sculpted and
detailed here, and I particularly love the yellow eyes on Magnficus as
well as the two silver lines running down the top of his head.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Magnificus may not have
all that original of a color scheme, but it works for the most part, with
the silver, red, and black playing off of each other quite well. The gray
is a bit boring, and there's a couple of minor places where I would've
changed the color, but overall this is a pretty cool redeco. However, it's
also rather expensive even for an exclusive like this, and I think Autobot
Alliance Perceptor's colors are slightly better than Magnificus'-- thus,
I think the recommended audience for this toy is definitely limited.

       Once Military Affairs Advisor for Mebion,
Magnificus was betrayed by an unknown comrade and banished to frontier
space. Forced to serve as a gun-for-hire, he has spent long years on the
run from bounty hunters with his comrade-in-arms, Gamede. But the pair
has finally found a means to achieve their revenge: body data stolen from
Perceptor using Gamede's ability to shrink to atomic size! Redesigning
his body using this data, Magnificus has successfully mastered the art
of "Psychometry", which is the ability to see residual images by scanning
objects and other lifeforms. Can Magnificus master this ability and use
it to determine the identity of his betrayer?
