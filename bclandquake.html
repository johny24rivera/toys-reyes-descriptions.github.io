    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Kickback. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Kickback

     Landquake is the second
part of the Club-exclusive combiner that will take until 2009 to complete,
with one component being part of each years' membership. Like the previous
combiner component
     <a href="skyfall.html">
      Skyfall
     </a>
     , Landquake is composed
primarily of transparent plastic. He keeps the same general color scheme
as Skyfall, but the amounts of the colors and their placement have been
changed. Now, a transparent red is by far the primary color scheme, comprising
the tank body, the Energon weapon and star, and the lower robot legs. In
fact, I think there's a bit TOO much of the transparent red-- another transparent
color should have been used to give the figure a bit less uniformity in
vehicle mode. The dull bluish periwinkle, black, and dull gray make excellent
contrasting colors to the red, and contrast amongst themselves pretty well
too. They're very Autobot-ish colors, though, so it's pretty weird that
they're on a Decepticon. (And speaking of which, considering Skyfall is
an Autobot-- it looks like this'll be the first multi-faction combiner,
folks!) Landquake certainly has more paint apps than Skyfall did (who barely
had any at all), but he still has less paint apps than the mold's previous
two uses as Kickback and
     <a href="blight.html">
      Blight
     </a>
     . All of the paint
apps do look very nice and contrast well on the colors they're next too,
however, and there is one new paint app that was on neither of the mold's
previous versions-- Landquake's forehead vent is painted black. It's a
pretty minor paint app, to be sure, but still worth noting.

     No mold changes have
been made to Landquake-- however, many of Landquake's joints are a less
tight than on previous versions of the mold-- the knee joints, especially.
    </font>
    <br/>
    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Landquake has a nice,
if not very Decepticon-y, paint job that looks pretty cool if you have
a strong light shining from behind him. However, his color scheme doesn't
match up to the awesomeness of Blight or Kickback, and he doesn't have
as many paint apps as them either. If you live in the U.S. or attend Botcon
regularly, than the Collectors' Club subscription is worth the money and
thus you'll get Landquake regardless, but if you aren't a member of the
club I can't recommend going out of your way to hunt Landquake down.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Landquake has served Megatron since
the very beginning of the Cybertronian Civil War. As an Energon flow analyst
at the Kalis refineries, he had become obsessed with the idea that his
destiny held a greater purpose. With the first attacks on Mini-Con settlements,
he threw in his lot with Megatron, seeing in the Decepticon cause a means
to achieve this greater destiny. Centuries of association with the Decepticons
have proven to him that the movement he once believed in is little more
than a vehicle for its leader's ego. He undertakes the missions he is assigned
with less than total dedication. Preoccupied as he is with self-doubt,
and desiring the rigid structure of a real army, he often finds his duties
for Megatron almost as boring as his old refinery duties. Landquake is
a terrifying opponent in battle. His EM pulse cannons can scramble the
circuits of even hardened targets, and the blast from hi Energon plasma
weapon is formidable enough to destroy many small to medium-sized targets
at close range. Rocket-assisted leaps and glides can offer a devastating
surprise to an unwary enemy. His long exposure to raw Energon has given
him Energon refinement and shaping capabilities superior to even the Omnicons.
With a sufficient supply of raw Energon, he can create an array of formidable
weapons.
