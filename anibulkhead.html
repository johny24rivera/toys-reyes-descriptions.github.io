    Bulkhead's vehicle mode
is one of the most unidentifiable out of the initial waves of Animated.
It's... a really chunky military transport thing. Really don't know how
to describe it better than that. Out of all of the Animated bots that has
an "Earth mode", this is definitely one of the toys with the most exaggerated
style-wise with its extremely round proportions. I'm not all that fond
of proportions quite THIS exaggerated, honestly, but on the plus side there's
no real robot extras visible in this mode. There's an abrupt curvature
on the roof of the vehicle near the back end as a side effect of those
parts forming the lower arms in robot arms, but no actual "robot parts"
like hands or anything are visible, so I hestitate to call those "extras".
As expected from an Animated toy, his mold detailing is rather sparse,
though his paint detailing is fair, particularly on the front end. His
back end-- namely, the molded-in doors-- could really use some paint, howeve,r
and the front end could use some more paint on the bumper.

    Bulkhead's robot mode
definitely has some good and some bad to it. The most obvious bad point
which I'll get to is that he has a LOT of backpack kibble. Pretty much
the covering to the entire back half of his vehicle mode is hanging off
of his backpack, and unfortunately most of it doesn't lock into place.
This is especially annoying on the side panels, which though fairly tight
aren't quite tight enough to stay flush with the surrounding parts. On
the plus side, the two large panels that hang up and over his shoulders
have a way to angle slightly away from each other, which looks quite a
lot better sitting over Bulkhead's shoulders than if they were just to
stay as one solid piece above his head. Bulkhead's proportions are also
very love-or-hate-- they're fairly accurate to the show, but his legs are
very tiny, and his waist and arms very large. (The only real difference
proportion-wise when it comes to his main body is that the upper arms on
the toy are skinnier than they are on the show.) I don't mind it, though
it's not my favorite Animated look. It does give Bulkhead a TON of personality
just from a casual glance, though, and his "strong jaw" look etched into
his face really accentuates that personality. He has only three oddly-positioned
finger-claws at the end of each arm, which also accentuates his whole "clumsy"
personality, as it's hard to imagine anyone being particularly dextrous
with those hands. As for his gimmick, Bulkhead's got three. The first has
to do with his transformation-- as you bring his lower legs into their
set position in robot mode, the head flips around into its proper place
AND the arms swing forward-- a pretty impressive "Automorph" gimmick, I
must say. Bulkhead has a second gimmick on his right arm, though I'd barely
call it a gimmick-- straighten out his arm and then press on the large
black lever on his upper arm and them the lower arm jerks up in a weak
"punching" action. Pretty lame. Bulkhead's combat-oriented gimmick has
to do with the "wrecking ball" he uses often in the show-- open up the
claws on his left arm and press up on the lever near his elbow and his
wrecking ball will launch out, on a tether. (You fold up the tether in
the lower arm again and push the ball back in while pressing down on that
same lever to reset the gimmick.) It's a fairly cool gimmick, though the
wrecking ball could use some paint. And speaking of his overall color scheme,
military green and black isn't the most exciting scheme in the world, but
it works for Bulkhead, and the green military stars make him look like
a bit of an homage to G1 Hound in terms of paint apps, honestly. The milky
brownish-gray and bronze serve as nice accent colors, as well, so no problems
there-- and his more of his paint apps go towards breaking up his robot
mode compared to his vehicle mode, so he looks noticeably more interesting
in this mode. As far as articulation goes, Bulkhead can move at the neck,
shoulders (at three points), elbows, at the base of each claw, and at the
hips (at two points) and knees (at two points). However, he is a bit back-heavy,
which can limit his poses when combined with his tiny legs.

    Animated Voyager Bulkhead
is honestly one of the weaker Voyager-class toys, due to his kibble-tastic
robot mode, though he's definitely not the worst. He still has a lot of
character and a kibble-free (if funky-looking) vehicle mode. If you like
the character and money isn't an object, I'd go for the

    instead, easily-- however, this one isn't too bad of
a substitute.

      If there's one thing Bulkhead is really
good at, it's smashing stuff. It's his specialty. In fact, he's so good
at it that he's even good at it when he doesn't mean to be. In a fight,
you can count on him to smash the Decepticons, nearby parked cars, other
Autobots, low-floating billboards, and occasionally himself. The irony
of it is that he's a natural builder who loves to make things. He'd much
rather be creating something, but when you're as big and strong as he is,
stuff just sort of seems to get smashed.
