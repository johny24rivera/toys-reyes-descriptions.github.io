    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance deluxe
Optimus Prime. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot

     The original
     <a href="bcprime.html">
      Shattered
Glass Optimus Prime
     </a>
     was one of the most heavily-desired toys that Fun
Publications (the people behind Botcon) had ever produced, and so they
released another version of the character, to help placate those who wanted
a Shattered Glass Optimus Prime but didn't want to spend as much as the
original was going for on eBay, and to get more mileage out of the mold
as well, I would imagine. Regardless, Shattered Glass Prime's color scheme
remains pretty much the exact same as on the original 2008 exclusive version--
that is, pretty darned awesome. The reddish purple and black/charcoal black
serve nicely as a "Prime viewed under a dark light" look, and despite being
upgraded, it's still obvious he doesn't take care of himself. He's got
silver "paint scratches" all over the place, particularly on his legs.
It's SO MUCH paint it makes it that much more special, considering there's
no way a retail release could've gotten this much paint on this size of
a toy. He's also got some great accent colors, like the bright green headlights
that contrast perfectly with the purple, as well as some off-white and
some nice metallic gold paint apps that go well with either the purple
or black. The transparent plastic used for this toy is a really nice shade,
being a metallic shade of yellow almost to the point of being gold, and
it just looks choice as the windows. To fit in with the slightly over-the-top
deco, Shattered Glass Prime also has lightning bolts on the sides of his
truck mode, a "worn" large Autobot symbol on his front hood, and "I Shall
Stand... The Rest Shall Fall" logo painted on both sides of the nose of
his truck mode, continuing his schtick of having "evil" versions of Optimus
Prime's famous mottos painted on him. The Autobot symbol is the only paint
app I'm not crazy about-- I'm not a fan of huge faction symbols.

     No mold changes have
been made to Shattered Glass Optimus Prime 2.0, beyond the shortening of
one of the shoulder connector tabs that's been done to all but the initial
mass release of this mold, which allows better shoulder movement.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     The 2nd Shattered Glass
Optimus Prime has just as great of a color scheme as the first and is extremely
eye-catcing, with an amazing amount of paint apps and an appropriate amount
of a "tongue-in-cheek" feel to him. This is my favorite release of the
mold, but I still like the original Shattered Glass Optimus Prime better,
considering how superior that mold is to this one.

       During a major offensive in Sector 17
of the Mirtonian Quadrant, Optimus Prime was severely damaged and his Laser
Core almost extinguished. Abandoned by his own warriors, he managed to
drag himself to a CR Chamber in a remote outpost nearby. With the help
of a local tech, he was able to fashion a new, upgraded body. Reborn, this
body not only provided Optimus with more strength and faster processing
power but it also affected his psyche making him believe that he was indestructible
and the true embodiment of power. Returning to Polyhex, he destroyed several
of his warriors who had abandoned him and re-established his role as leader.
In addition to upgrading his body, Optimus also updated his weaponry by
fashioning a sword out of the mysterious "G-Metal", allowing him to slice
through enemies in a single blow.
