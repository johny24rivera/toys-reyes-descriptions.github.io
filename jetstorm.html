    Beast mode is a dragonfly.
A nicely done mode on top, but his robot legs are clearly visible and can
get in the way. His insect legs are extremely small. His robot head can
also be easily seen in his beast head. Detailing is decent, but nothing
extraordinary.

    Robot mode is okay,
but it has a lot of extras. His missle launchers on his sides can be fired
too easily, also. Some of his extras are his four wings, and his insect
legs on his robot legs, and his dragonfly back. The dragonfly back can
be filled up with water through a pump in his tail, and then he can spit
acid out of his mouth by pushing up on the lever on his dragonfly tail.
This can also work in beast mode.

    A nice transformer,
although he has quite a bit of extras in both modes.

      Predacon...until it's too late! Striking
silently from the sky, Jetstorm's internal coolant capacitors produce a
toxic venom that, when regurgitated from his mouth, can destroy an enemy
at a range of 500 feet. To keep his aerial competition in check, Jetstorm
can launch twin air-to-air missiles that explode on impact in a blaze of
destruction!
