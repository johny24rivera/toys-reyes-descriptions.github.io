    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Voyager Leobreaker.

     As part of the 5th anniversary
of Fun Publications' taking over of Botcon, they released a special set
of exclusives in 2009 that actually came from ideas seen in their earlier
sets. Razorclaw here is one of them, briefly seen in the "Dawn of Futures
Past" comic from Botcon 2006. This same idea of doing Razorclaw from Leobreaker
has actually already been done from the
     <a href="specialteamleaders.html">
      Legends
class toy
     </a>
     of the character in Universe 2.0, but here is gets the bonafide
Voyager-class treatment. I'm not usually a fan of yellow, but the G1 Predacons
have always been an exception to that usual rule, and Razorclaw here is
no different. The golden yellow is quite fitting for a lion, and goes really
well with the black and orange/red to create a very "fiery" color scheme,
but without being too loud in my opinion. The gunmetal gray used for the
technorganic "muscle fiber" is a particularly nice detail, but overall
he's got a pretty good amount of paint detailing, the sole exception being
the lower arms, which only have the claws painted. The only color I'm not
fond of on Razorclaw is the milky metallic off-white-- it looks good against
the black, but the other colors are too light for it to effectively serve
as a contrasting color-- particularly against the golden yellow, it can
be hard to see in those cases. Also of note is that Razorclaw has a slimmed-down
version of the Predacon symbol on his upper arms, which looks pretty interesting.

     Razorclaw has a new
head mold, based pretty heavily on his G1 self. The mane "ponytail" still
looks remarkably good hanging off the G1-head, though, and the sculpting
on the new head is pretty solid. I do wish Razorclaw's visor was a slightly
different from his faceplate to help differentiate the two visually, however.
Like most Botcon exclusives, the electronics on the toy have been gutted.
The Cyber Key on the figure has also been changed to resemble the "Golden
Disk Key" that came with most of the 2006 exclusives, though it's also
transparent on this toy for some reason.

     Botcon 2009 Razorclaw
is a nice homage with great colors, but the mold leaves much to be desired.
Combine this with the fact that this toy has already essentially been released
at mass-retail (just at Legends class), and only the biggest collectors
and/or Predacon fans should consider hunting this guy down.

       At the end of the Third Cybertronian
War, the Decepticon army, at long last, was no more. With many Decepticons
destroyed or in hiding, Razorclaw came to realize that if the Autobots
were to ever be defeated, a new army must carry on the fight. A Predacon
Army! In time the "Predacon" empire became the main opposition to the Autobots.
They attacked Cybertron with ferocity never before seen. The Predacons
appeared to have a chance at achieving what the Decepticons never could...
victory! However, just as with the Decepticons, treachery and deceit existed
within the Predacon ranks, and the three who would become the Tripredacus
Council assassinated Razorclaw... or so it was believed. Now, many stellar
cycles after the reformatting of Cybertron, the Predacons have returned,
with Razorclaw once again leading the army. What happened and how he returned
is a mystery. What is known is that he is stronger and more determined
than ever, and he will do what is needed to take back Cybertron and destroy
every last Maximal!
