    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Beast Wars
Rattrap Transmetal. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of
the original Beast Wars Rattrap Transmetal

     Unlike the other Beast
Wars 10th Anniversary repaints, Rattrap's re-release is not of his original
form, but of his Transmetal version. This is likely because A. Rattrap
Transmetal is a deluxe-sized toy, and the
     <a href="rattrap.html">
      original
Rattrap
     </a>
     is not, and B. The mold for the original Rattrap toy is lost.
(Didn't stop Hasbro from including a DVD with him that stars him in his
original form anyways-- le sigh.) Anyways, 10th Anniversary Rattrap is
almost unchanged when compared to his original Transmetal version. The
only differences are that the light gray plastic has been made a shade
or two lighter on this version, and the robot optics are show-accurate
red, not green anymore. Plus, he has a new Maximal symbol painted on the
left side of his chest. Other than that, he's the same.

     The new version of Rattrap
is a decent buy if you A. Like the character or B. Don't have the original
version of this mold, but otherwise, there's better toys out there for
your money.

       Getting stranded on a remote, empty
world to serve as a spy and sneak-thief for Optimus Primal wasn't high
on his list of priorities for Rattrap. Smart, sneaky and sarcastic, Rattrap
often rubs other Maximals the wrong way. He's never been too keen on lobbing
artillery around like the others; a stand-up fight just isn't his thing.
Give him the chance to bust into a Predacon base and snatch some juicy
data though, and that's when he really shines.

        Put together from the
parts of all six of the Series I 10th Anniversary figures, it's kind of
hard to really recommend Transmutate as a good TOY-- he really has more
value for fans of the character or the Beast Wars series than as an actual,
playable toy. Reason being, Transmutate can't transform, he looks weird
(as is the point, obviously), and he has limited articulation. He can move
at a ball joint at the base of the neck, and back and forth at the shoulders,
and at the left hip, but that's it. Yes, that's right-- due to an incredibly
stupid design decision, Transmutate CANNOT move at the right hip. Try to
move him there and you will break the leg off, despite the fact that it
looks like it can move there. So overall, I'm not really recommending unless
you really have a thing for the character, given his low playability and
what you have buy in order to complete him.
