    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Swelter. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of Swelter

     Glacius is Swelter's
element-opposite brother... or cousin... or redeco. Anyways. It's ice Swelter
(not to be confused with
     <a href="rid2minicon4pk1.html">
      Blizzard Strike
Swelter
     </a>
     ). He's mostly a dark blue plastic, which has a bit of glitter
in it so it is a semi-metallic shade of the color, which gives it just
a nice bit of "sheen" to make it icy. Although it's not easily visible
in either mode (it's mostly used on the back and the tail, as well as the
feet), Glacius also has a decent amount of dull pale blue which has a definite
"arctic" shade to it, like partially frozen sea slush. It both complements
and contrasts against the blue, though I wish it was used more on the front
of the figure for more prevalent color differentiation, as there's just
too much unbroken dark blue plastic on the toy. There's also some white
on the waist and the headcrest on the robot mode, which looks GREAT against
this shade of blue and I wish was used a little more on the toy. Glacius
also has dark red eyes, which are a bit TOO dark to the point where they
don't contrast enough against the blue plastic. Finally, the armor bits
have been recolored into a transparent light icy blue, which is a pretty
nice shade and, again, complements and contrasts against the dark blue
pretty nicely. That said, in terms of the mold details the color doesn't
make as much sense-- we've all heard of flamethrowers like those on Swelter,
but re-coloring those pieces so they look like... uh... icethrowers? Yeah,
that doesn't work as well. That said, much of the "fiery" armor bits now
look like frozen ice bits, which is cool.

     No mold changes have
been made to Glacius-- so unfortunately, his icethrower armor pieces are
still attached by pegs that are entirely too shallow and can fall off at
the drop of a hat.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Out of the three versions
of this mold, I like Glacius the best. Although there's too much dark blue
in terms of plastic, the lighter arctic blue plastic and transparent blue
armor complement and contrast against it pretty nicely, and the couple
of bits of white paint are nicely placed, as well. It's a nice color scheme
overall-- not quite as good as Blizzard Strike Swelter's, but the latter
doesn't come with armor pieces, so there you go.
