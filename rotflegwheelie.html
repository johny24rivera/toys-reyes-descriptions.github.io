    Wheelie's alternate mode,
already meant to be a toy version of a monster truck, works pretty well
at this small scale. Heck, if anything it looks a bit MORE "real" than
his
    <a href="rotfwheelie.html">
     deluxe toy
    </a>
    , what with more square angles
and more realistic-proportioned tires. From a front or slightly angled
view, this mode looks great, and the dark blue and gray color scheme, though
not particularly eye-catching, is pretty decent. The mud-brown, light metallic
blue, and silver paint all contrast quite well aginst the dark blue, the
brown used for the windows being an odd choice, but one that makes a bit
of sense given the alt mode. Unfortunately, if you look at this mode from
a side view-- or, even worse, a back view-- the robot mode extras become
readily apparent. Wheelie's face sticks out quite blatantly from the backside
of the driver's seat area, and his chest is pretty obvious on the rear
end of the vehicle-- it also sticks down almost to the ground, elminating
the high clearance the main body of the truck should have from the ground.
Plus, his arms are merely folded across in between the four wheels, making
even more kibble obvious in between his wheels.

    Wheelie's robot mode
is definitely where the design was focused, and it looks great-- in some
ways, in fact, even better than the deluxe! His main body has some great
mold and paint detailing on it, and his head is very well-sculpted and
considerably more movie-accurate than the head on his deluxe toy. His appendages
are a bit TOO stick-like, but at this scale there's little that can be
done about that, considering that they ARE rather skinny on the actual
movie model. I do wish his hands looked less like mere hooks, though. His
feet are just as they are in the movie-- wheels-- with a small part of
the front bumper sticking out unceremoniously behind said wheels to stabilize
the figure. It's not a particularly pretty solution, but it's better than
having Wheelie unable to stand up. Wheelie can move at the neck (at two
points), shoulders, elbows, and hips (at two points), which is fairly good
for a tiny toy like this.

    Legends class RotF Wheelie
is an excellent and faithful recreation of the character in robot mode,
but although he looks good in vehicle mode from the front, from most other
angles his robot parts are a bit too painfully obvious, knocking his score
down a fair bit. Given that he's a tiny Wheelie and thus more in scale
with most other deluxe-and-larger TF toys, he's a pretty decent little
toy given the inherent restrictions, but I think the deluxe version is
a bit better of a toy.
