    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original DotM legion
Bumblebee toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original DotM legion Bumblebee toy

     Well, we all knew it
was inevitable; pretty much every movie Bumblebee mold gets repainted in
reverse "stealth" colors, and the new DotM legion-class toy is no exception.
As with Moviebee's other "stealth" redecos, black is now the main color,
with yellow being used mostly for the stripes in vehicle mode and some
of the robot mode paint detailing. However, on this Stealth version there's
a bit more yellow than usual; the lower legs (which also make up the back
third or so of the car mode) remain the same old type of orange-yellow
that movie Bumblebee's always had. If there were some sort of "fade" paint
apps near the back end to have the black gradually transition into yellow
it would've looked better, but there aren't. It looks a bit sudden, particularly
on the roof. (This thankfully doesn't carry over to the robot mode, where
the yellow lower legs are definitely visually separate from his other parts.)
On a lesser note, Bumblebee has the same silver/blue window paint apps
that most of his toys have, and they look even better against the black
than they usually do against the yellow. (His rear window still isn't painted,
though... grrr.) The gold Autobot symbol near the front is also a bit of
a nice touch; makes me wish the rest of his yellow paint was tweaked like
that...

     The Cyberverse DotM
Stealth Bumblebee redeco offers most of what you'd expect from a "reverse
colors" paint job of BB, but with a few surprises-- most of them not in
a good way. Even though it's been done a lot, I quite like the "stealth"
color layout, and adding in more of the same ol' orangish yellow along
the back end/legs of the figure doesn't really click with me as much as
if they had been black plastic like most of the rest of him. Still recommended
above the original release of the mold, but not as much as it otherwise
would have been if it had stuck solely to tradition in this case.

      A new paint scheme can confuse Decepticon
targeting systems. They might think Bumblebee is less of a threat if he
looks like a different Autobot.
