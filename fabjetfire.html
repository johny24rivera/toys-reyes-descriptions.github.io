    Since Fast Action Battlers
are aimed at a younger audience than the "normal" Transformers, their alt
modes tend to be a bit more rounded and "kiddy-looking" than the mainline
Transformers, but Jetfire here is an example of this principle taken waaaay
too far. Forget slightly younger audience, this looks positively Go-Bots-ish
or Power-Bots-ish. It's waaaay superdeformed, with everything super rounded,
the nosecone waaay too short and fat, and the main body of the plane too
small. Still, if this was all that was wrong with Jetfire's Blackbird SR-71
alt form, it would be somewhat forgiveable. But in spite of these superdeformed
proportions, he's got some major robot parts hanging off his bottom side--
his entire robot arms and face, namely. Having "boosters" formed from the
tips of the arms in one way or another helps to offset it slightly since
it makes them look a little like exhaust fumes (even if they're gray and
coming from the wrong places), but they're still incredibly obvious and
ruins and remaining sleekness the toy may have had. The robot face also
looks RIGHT AT YOU from rear view, which is rather disorienting. On the
plus side, there are quite a lot of mold details on Jetfire, including
myriad panel detaling in this mode and the requisite robot pistons/robotic
detailing in robot mode. The red line detailing also looks quite good against
the black, and the metallic blue used for the cockpit is a nice color.
The otherwise all-black-and-dark-gray color scheme is accurate, but rather
boring, though.

    As many problems as
I have with Jetfire's vehicle mode, his robot mode is even worse. The proportions
are just abhorrent, even allowing for the simpler transformation of a Fast
Action Battler. His hips stick out waaaay too far from his main body, and
his upper thighs are way too large in proportion to his lower legs, which
bend backwards a bit TOO far in their "chicken leg" configuration. In comparison,
Jetfire's arms are too small and a little on the skinny side, not to mention
the shoulders are attached too close to the chest-- they aren't broad enough.
The face detailing, while... okay... is off overall, with his "beard" and
"ear hair" not sticking out nearly enough to make it obviously Jetfire.
It looks more like he just has a ridged faceplate on instead. The added
metallic copper coloring in this mode makes the color scheme pop a bit
more, though, and the chest detailing and pelvis detailing is great. The
vehicle mode bits flip up behind Jetfire's main body pretty well without
getting in the way of what articulation he does have. (He can move up-and-down
at the head, as well as at the shoulders (at two points), hips (at two
points), knees, and ankles. Even most of these limited points are rather
restricted, though, and given Jetfire's odd proportions on top of that,
he's not very posable at all, even for a Fast Action Battler. Each one
of Jetfire's arms has its own gimmick-- the right arm has a spring-loaded
missile launcher attached, while his left arm has his trademark cane that
can flip out and provide him with some extra balance.

    Photon Missile Jetfire
is a pretty bad figure all around, from his superdeformed and extra-laden
vehicle mode to his horribly-proportioned and badly-articulated robot mode.
If you want a Jetfire figure but don't want the super-complicated Leader
class version, get the cheaper Legends figure instead. I really can't recommend
this figure to any kind of audience.

is ready to rejoin the fight! He realized the error of the Decepticon way
