    Mold History
   </b>
   : Silverstreak's mold
was originally planned for release in the Go-Bots line for Transformers:
Generation 2, but it never went through. His mold was finally released
in RiD as Sideswipe, and now it's been repainted as Silverstreak!

    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Spychanger Sideswipe. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of the Spychanger Sideswipe

     Out of all the G1-Themed
Spychangers, Silversteak is probably the least like his
     <a href="silverstreak.html">
      G1
counterpart
     </a>
     . Of course, his robot mode doesn't look like anything resembling
his G1 version, but that's common among all of this particular line of
Spychangers, minus
     <a href="g1spyprime.html">
      Optimus Prime
     </a>
     . He's a
sportscar like the original Bluestreak, and his color scheme has some similar
colors, like the silver, but that's where the similiarites end. For one,
he really doesn't have all that much silver on him, unlike his G1 counterpart,
which was covered with the stuff. On this Spychanger, it's mostly limited
to the front bumper and hood. The rest of his car mode is a dark blue-gray-
not unlike silver, but not close enough to really be considered the same
color. It looks fairly good, although I wish there was a few more brighter
paint apps, as his vehicle mode does come off looking a bit dull. The white
helps a lot in the robot mode, although his almost complete lack of the
color red really doesn't make him that much of a homage in robot mode at
all. In fact, if he hadn't been named Silverstreak, I really wouldn't have
made the connection to the G1 character.

     Silverstreak is a decent
repaint, and about on par with his mold's predecessor, Sideswipe. His car
mode may look a bit duller Sideswipe's, but the colors in robot mode are
pretty nice, if not a G1 homage like the other G1 Spychangers. However,
he is slightly more expensive ($4 U.S.), so I had to rate him ever-so-slightly
lower than his predecessor.

       Always on overdrive, Silverstreak is
an incessant talker whose sharp humor can lighten tense situations. Formidable
weapons and incendiary speed make him an impressive adversary, although
the memory of his home-city's destruction has left him with a lasting distaste
for war. Equipped with long-range bombing capability and 80,000 volt attack
beam.
