    Slog's alternate mode
is a brachiosaurus-- he's not in the movie, but was added to the tail end
of the AoE line likely to help round out the "traditional" Dinobot cast,
essentially being a replacement for G1 Sludge, who was a brontosaurus.
Slog's core proportions in this mode are quite good-- near-perfect, even.
The front legs are longer than the back legs just like you'd expect on
a brachiosaur, and the tail is rather short. There's also no robot mode
bits sticking out in the mode at all except for the kneecaps behind the
rear legs, but given how well these pieces blend in with the back of the
legs, this is a minor downside at best. More than the other Dinobots, Slog
has less of a "EXTREME spikey" look and more of a "armored-up, fossil-like
bony" look to him. There's tons of extremely well-sculpted ridges all over
him, with the sides of the body, tail, and neck looking especially good.
The only parts that could really be considered "spikes" on Slog are the
large ridges coming up out of the sides of his main body and shoulders,
though these look more like halves of ribcage bones than spikes (they are
made of rubbery plastic for safety purposes, though). The piece for Slog's
lower neck is also rubbery, and it's here that we run into my main issue
with this toy-- you HAVE to bend this rubbery bit to get it into its assigned
slot in this mode between the shoulders, and it's quite difficult to get
it all lined up so it looks "just right". There's also a noticeable gap
in between the bottom of his neck and where the actual "meat" of the body
begins, about a third of the way back behind his body. From most viewpoints
it's only a minor issue, but it still bugs me. For a color scheme, Slog's
is honestly largely boring; he's mostly just light milky gray and black,
with some red along his back and extremities to give at least some color.
There's also just a touch of silver paint on his front legs and head crest,
and he has the usual Autobot-blue eyes, but these don't really add much
to the color scheme. I do really like the red "vein" paint apps along his
shoulders that extend from the 5mm port in said shoulders, almost like
they're veins of "power"-- it looks quite cool. Still, overall way too
much of him is just blah gray or black, and nothing that stands out that
much, particularly when compared to the other retail AoE Dinobots. Slog
also has two quite large and long lances that are slotted into holes above
his shoulders in this mode, and it's not hard to see them being guns in
this mode, along with the two smaller double-gun accessories that are pegged
into his shoulders proper. The lances can be removed, but if you do there's
rather obvious round black protrusions sticking out of the sides of his
neck, so I recommend keeping the lances inserted. For articulation in this
mode, Slog can move at the jaw, head, neck (at two points), shoulders (at
two points), front knees (at two points), and rear knees (at two points).
His hips LOOK like they can move, but because of the transformation and
parts surrounding them they actually can't without unpegging his rear section.
The lance-guns can also move at three points-- all in all, pretty good,
hips aside.

    From the front at least,
Slog's robot mode looks pretty good. His brachiosaurus parts are largely
absent (obvious tail pieces on his hips aside, which do get in the way
of articulation there some). He's got a nice, bulky look to him, and the
intricate detailing on his chest fits in perfectly with the rest of his
heavily-armored look, with the different pieces on said chest looking like
interlocking bone armor quite nicely. The rubbery "skirt" made from part
of the brachiosaur's rear top is pretty nicely done, too. The headsculpt
is one of the more "out-there" headsculpts for the Dinobots, but still
looks like a knight, with a visor and faceplate-- though it's a bit wider
and more powerful-looking headsculpt, with the ridges on the forehead helping
to make him look more unique. His leg transformation is absolutely ingenious,
involving folding his dino mode main body parts around the rear legs and
then keeping it all together with the kneecaps from said rear legs pegging
securely into the front while the typical AoE Dinobot "pointy knight shoes"
fold out from the main dino body. On the other hand, I do wish his arms
transformed a bit more-- they're literally just the dino front legs with
small fists folded out below the dino feet. From a side view, one can see
the problems with Slog, and that it's related to his main issue in dino
mode-- that is, that darned rubbery plastic lower dino neck/chest piece.
His dino upper back, neck, and head all just hang unceremoniously from
behind his robot back. The dino head in particular sticks out too far back,
and the rubbery plastic piece sticks out below his waist in a rather unsightly
manner, even if it's mostly hidden from a frontal look simply because of
how beefy and spiky the robot legs and skirt are. You also have to stretch
and move around this rubbery piece a bit-- I'm concerned about this piece
warping over time, depending upon which mode you tend to keep Slog in.
A bit of the upper back piece does protrude obviously behind Slog's head,
but it doesn't bug me that much-- honestly, a guy as beefy as Slog probably
shouldn't have his robot head sticking up above everything else, but rather
sunk in a bit to emphasize how "muscle-y" he is. Slog's dual-gun pieces
still can stick into his shoulders in this mode, and he can hold his large
lances somewhat loosely in his fist holes, though the black pieces attached
to them-- which help them connect in dino mode-- are a bit of an eyesore
in this mode, and make the rear end of the lances a bit overly bulky. For
articulation, Slog can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points; three
if you include the "shoulder armor" bits), elbows (at two points), slightly
inwards at the wrists, waist rotation, and at the hips (at two points),
knees (at two points), and at the ankles. However, the tail bits at the
hips and the kibble around them do interfere with waist and hip movement
a fair bit, along with a connection betwen the "core" of his main body
and his waist being a little weaker and coming undone a little easier than
I'd like. The wrists also could really, REALLY use some rotational movement,
as the way the arms are set up it's difficult for Slog to hold his lances
in a natural pose. Still, overall he's fairly good in this department,
and despite his back kibble, he's quite stable.

    AoE Slog is a pretty
interesting and unique piece, with an awesome brachiosaurus mode and a
generally good robot mode, even if the latter does have some kibble issues.
Some parts of his transformation-- his feet in particular-- are just flat-out
ingenious, but it is worth noting I'm concerned about the rubbery plastic
piece that forms the lower neck/chest of his dino mode becoming warped
over time considering how much you have to stretch and bend it in both
modes. His color scheme is also rather boring compared to the other mass-release
AoE Dinobot toys. Mildly recommended, so long as you keep the aforementioned
rubbery plastic issue in mind and don't mind mildly complex transformations--
I could see little 'uns getting confused by his leg transformation.

      Slog is low on brainpower, even by Dinobot
standards. He's slow, lumbering, and absolutely gigantic. When you're that
big, most problems get stamped out pretty quickly, sometimes before you
even know they're there. But what Slog lacks in brains he makes up for
in brawn. Anything he tramples snaps under his massive feet. The Dinobots
know that he can clear a path through any enemy line... as long as they
point him in the right direction first.
