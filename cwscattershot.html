    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Silverbolt.

Scattershot is a remold of Silverbolt, although not as extensive of a remold.
Nearly all of the robot parts are the same; most of the changes have been
made to the vehicle mode, to make it more futuristic and closer to G1 Scattershot's
alt mode, which is a futuristic spacecraft... thing. The wing pieces have
been considerably thinned out, and instead of being solid are now mostly
diagonal and horizontal bars criss-crossing each other, each ending in
a tip that looks a little like a gun. The mold detailing is rather futuristic
on them, as befits Scattershot. The wings' plastic-- without being reinforced
by being more "solid"-- does feel a bit flimsy, however. It likely won't
break by accident unless you outright step on the figure in the wrong way,
but it would be quite easy to purposely snap them (so don't do it, natch).
My biggest issue with these wings is that, since they aren't as solid,
the robot parts show through them in vehicle mode considerably easier.
The nosecone has also been completely re-done, into what essentially is
a long, narrow gunbarrel with a tiny black-painted cockpit window above
it. I love thinking of Scattershot as essentially a flying gun, so I love
this change. The middle tailfin has been changed to also look like it's
got a gun at the top, and has more futuristic detailing. The only robot
mode mold change (besides the reinforced robot ab/gestalt neck piece, used
in later runs of this mold that makes it harder to break during transformation)
is a new headsculpt, which looks a fair bit like a more modernized, better-proportioned
G1 Scattershot head-- but with an oddly large, wide Jay Leno-esque chin.
I also wish his visor and face were a different color, as together they
don't contrast all that well with the off-white used for the rest of the
head.

     Speaking of colors,
Scattershot's main colors are two different shades of red-- a rather semi-metallic,
milky shade and a dull shade-- and off-white. The red and off-white go
together fairly well, even if it isn't the most exciting color scheme in
the world. That said, there's too much unbroken red, particularly in vehicle
mode. The two shades of red aren't different enough to contrast against
each other, and the paint apps are mostly used on the gun and on the head
and chest area in robot mode. I really like the light pastel blue used
on the chest, waist, and head, and wish it was used on more of the red,
as those two colors contrast extremely well together and "pop" nicely.
The gun is coated in silver paint, along with the "nozzle" of the vehicle
nosecone and two small stripes on the main wings. Other than that, silver
isn't used outside of the Autobot symbols and the gestalt faceplate, which
I feel is another missed opportunity for more color contrast. Same with
the light orange used for the gestalt antennae-- it's another great color
that isn't used anywhere else and really would've looked good. Or, heck,
include some of the brown from the G1 toy for some more color variety.
This toy definitely needs something more color-wise, though.

     The single-packed version
of CW Scattershot is rather difficult to recommend. Except for the skinny,
flimsy wings, he's a pretty decent Silverbolt remold, and the color scheme
isn't outright bad, but the paint apps are too clustered together in robot
mode. The vehicle mode looks way too bland with too much red, and certain
parts of the robot and especially the torso mode suffer from this issue
as well. A greater variety/number of colors was definitely needed-- as
well as a new gestalt headsculpt, as Computron's headsculpt is not Superion's!
As is, this is the weakest of the three variants of this design used in
the Combiner Wars line, and I would only recommend this to people who definitely
want

       Scattershot can form Combiner robots
that aren't slowed by the conflict that comes from merging five personalities
into one. He's the secret weapon the Autobots call on when they need to
quickly form and re-form new Combiner robots during battle.
