    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations Drift. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations Drift

     Deadlock was Drift's
Decepticon alter-ego/persona before he became Drift in the IDW comics,
and this redeco-- shared between e-HOBBY and the Transformers Collectors'
Club-- is colored like Deadlock (although in the comics Deadlock had a
slightly different body, which isn't reflected in this release). Deadlock's
main colors are black and purple-- certainly very Decepticon-y colors,
and the transparent cherry red used for the windows makes Deadlock's alt
mode in particular look VERY evil-- it's a nice color combo. That said,
the purple is a bit duller than I'd like, and doesn't contrast against
the black or stand out as much as I'd prefer. What really helps to make
Deadlock's color scheme are his accent paint apps, which are mostly visible
in robot mode. There's some dull gold on his wheel hubs, his waist, and
lower legs; some red on his knees, feet, waist, chest, and shoulders; and
white on his head, lower arms, and waist. The gold helps Deadlock look
a bit more "royal", and contrasts against the white and black pretty well.
The red carries his "eeevil" look a bit farther and is good in the amounts
used, and the white contrasts against the other colors nicely, but is thankfully
used sparingly so the toy doesn't look TOO much like Drift. The head does
still look a bit too much like Drift, but I figure if one part should be
similar between Deadlock &amp; Drift it's the head-- the pale purple face
and the large black "eyebrow" still helps differentiate Deadlock enough
while still making it obvious "hey, this guy becomes Drift"!

     No mold changes have
been made to Deadlock, but he does come with
     <a href="genblurr.html">

     sniper rifle and smaller guns in addition to Drift's long sword, which
makes sense since Deadlock wasn't big on swords initially.

     Deadlock is a pretty
good redeco, and this is definitely a recommended purchase for Drift fans
who have the money to be in the market for foreign/club exclusives. He's
got a lot of nice paint apps and a unique color scheme, and it's one of
the best early Generations molds to boot. The dull purple is my only real
issue; it needed to be lighter or something. He's not quite as well-done,
as, say,
     <a href="bcsgdrift.html">
      Shattered Glass Drift
     </a>
     , but he's pretty
close.
