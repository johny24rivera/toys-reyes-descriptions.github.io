    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Shockblast. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Shockblast

     Six Shot is certainly
an interesting redeco of Shockblast. Yellow, purple, red, and black, in
this combination isn't particularly my idea of a great color scheme for
a transformer. However... I don't think it's nearly as bad as many people
make it out to be. For one thing, the yellow used as the main color is
a very dull yellow, and hardly gaudy. The purple is a delicious metallic
purple, or a more dark purple that's only distinguishable from the charcoal
black under somewhat strong light. (Though as for the black itself, I would've
preferred a more pure black instead of this color-- it just looks a bit
better on a Transformer, I think.) The red is also the same red used for
     <a href="engalvatron.html">
      Energon Galvatron
     </a>
     , and looks REALLY great.
Individually, all of these colors aren't bad. In fact, if they had made
red or black the primary color and yellow the secondary color, I think
this would've been a GREAT color scheme. It's just that using yellow as
the main color doesn't fit well, and coupled with the hokey purple "camoflauge"
paint apps used, it makes Six Shot stand out, but in a way that's hardly
menacing. (I mean, really, a PURPLE and YELLOW camoflauge scheme? ...Huh?)
The camoflauge patterns also take away from details on the gun-hand and
the back of his other hand that could've been filled in with different-colored
paint apps that would've looked a little better. Though on the plus side,
I do think the red optic on Six Shot's face looks more menacing than Shockblast's
green optic. And I have to stress again how much I love the metallic purple
and red used on Six Shot.

     Six Shot isn't as bad
as much of the fandom has made him out to be-- he's not very gaudy, it's
just that yellow should NOT be his main color, and the purple camoflauge
patterns are pretty hokey. But I'd still recommend Shockblast over this
guy, no question.

       Six Shot is a powerful and cunning Decepticon
warrior. In tank mode, his treads can crush anything that ends up beneath
them. His Energon-enhanced cannon is so powerful, it is credited with bringing
down two Guardian robots during the Powerlinx Battles on Cybertron. Six
Shot's armor is nearly impervious and he loves to bash Autobot metal in
battle-royale fashion. His ultimate goal is to defeat Optimus Prime in
hand-to-fist combat and he patiently waits for the day this opportunity
will arise.
