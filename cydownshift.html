    Downshift, although not
in the Cybertron TV show, is a new version of the
    <a href="endownshift.html">
     Energon
Downshift
    </a>
    character, who WAS in the Energon TV show. Even though it's
a continuation of that mis-named Wheeljack character, it's nice to see
Hasbro showing us what's happened to older characters in this TF Universe
that aren't in the show anymore. They also labored to make Downshift a
bit more different from G1 Wheeljack this time around, seeing as how...
y'know, he isn't named Wheeljack anymore, so I guess they figured to just
go with it and differentiate him from Wheeljack a bit more. His vehicle
mode is a now a funky looking '60s, '70s-era muscle car. Green and black
are odd colors for a car, sure, but that was obviously the intention, both
to differentiate Downshift a bit more from being "just another Autobot
car" and because a few muscle cars actually ARE in those colors. However,
that doesn't keep the colors form being a bit ugly on a car, in my opinion.
However, it at least works to this figure's advantage in one respect--
although I would have found the transparent orange windows rather gaudy
on most other Transformers, it fits right in with this already-gaudy Autobot.
As for the overall proportions and look of this mode, they're spot-on,
nearly
    <a href="tfalternators.html">

    </a>
    -quality. No robot extras
whatsoever, seats molded inside the windows, and a roof molded to look
like leather to boot! Unfortunately, because of the realism of this mode,
there's also rather little mold detailing, though that's a pretty small
quibble. Downshift does have a good amount of paint detailing to help break
up all the undetailed plastic, however-- the gray-and-black lines on the
sides of the car look especially good, as does the exposed silver engine.
One of the great things about this mode, thoguh, is that if you want to
soup up Downshift to look less realistic and more "ruff 'n tuff", you can--
Downshift's rather large missile launchers peg into the sides of this mode,
and each missile launcher has a Minicon port on the top of it, so you can
add even more bulk to Downshift's frame. In addition, Downshift's Cyber
Key feature is pretty cool. Fold up a small panel on the rear window of
the vehicle and then insert the Key, and sharp-looking "jaws" pop open
from the front bumper, complete with what looks like a grinder in the center
of them-- now Downshift can do some serious melee damage even in his car
mode! This is a pretty cool gimmick, given that the actual place where
you insert the key is so far (relatively speaking) from where the gimmick
actually pops out, and that this gimmick is still able to be activated
after the transformation as well.

    Although Downshift's
vehicle mode is the better of his two modes, his robot mode is still fairly
good. I think his arms a tad on the puny side, and his chest is definitely
too big and long, but otherwise his prportions are good enough. His articulation
is also pretty good-- he can move at the waist, hips, knees, shoulders
(at two places), and knees. His head can't move at all, though, which is
a bit of a bummer. The headsculpt itself is great, though, with more defined,
less cartoony features than Energon Downshift had. The car windows and
hood on his back are the only real extras in this mode, and they stay out
of the way well enough not to get in the way of articulation or stick out
too obviously, so I don't mind it. Downshift's guns can be held in his
hands, or, if you want his hands to be free, you can hook them on his shoulders
instead-- a nifty feature. I guess my big problem with this mode is that
this same transformation of "car front as chest, rear as legs, doors and
shoulders and arms" has just been done so many times already, it's gotten
rather boring, especially since the "straight-out car front-as-chest" doesn't
look all that great. Still, overall, it's a pretty good robot mode, even
if it has a "been there, done that" look to it.

    Cybertron Downshift
is a decent mold with some great versatility in its features and weapons,
but its boring, overdone transformation and robot mode look, coupled with
its somewhat ugly color scheme, keep it from being a must-buy. It's still
a pretty good deluxe mold, however. Mildly recommended.

      A few years of experience in the Energon
Wars have gone a long way in Downshift. Once an impulsive speedster, he
has learned patience and consideration from his mentor Hot Shot. Where
he once would have raced straight into battle against even overwhelming
odds, relying on his speed to get him out of tight spots, he has now learned
to observe and enter a fight cautiously. His keen eye and quick reflexes
allow him to exploit even the smallest opportunity to bring down Decepticons
much bigger and stronger than him.
