    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Titanium RiD Optimus Prime.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Titanium RiD Optimus
Prime

     "Hot Zone", the new trademark-friendly
name for the G1 Protectobot Hot Spot, is, like his namesake, a light blue
firetruck-- an emergency vehicle coloration of a different kind than the
usual red you (or, at least, I) see on the streets. By itself the light
blue would be kinda blah, but using black and red really contrast well
against the pastel blue, and just make the whole-shebang look pretty nifty.
This particularly pertains to Hot Zone's robot mode, which is brimming
with excellently done paint apps-- the red sash, the silver paint detailing
that's almot prevalent in this mode as the black, the bits of metallic
gold for a bit of added color-- it really all comes together quite well,
not just referencing G1 Hot Spot but adding a bit to the "baby blue/red/black"
emergency vehicle color scheme. Unfortunately, this corucopia of colors
doesn't extend quite as well to vehicle mode, with the rather-nifty-looking
Autobot emergency symbols, the painted windows/window wipers, and a long
red stripe lengthwise across the sides being the only paint apps of note.
(The red line also tends to be a bit messy on most copies I've seen, sadly.)

     Hot Zone doesn't have
any mold changes, but the RiD Prime look in robot mode really exemplifies
his "Protectobot general" side, so I think even with the Prime-esque head
it works well for this character.

     Titanium Hot Zone is
a pretty nice color scheme on one of the better 6" Titaniums, and a unique
twist on the typical red fire truck color scheme. Overall I like it a bit
more than the 6" Titanium RiD Prime color scheme... but it's also $5 U.S.
more and doesn't come with a stand, so as far as value goes I'd have to
recommend RiD Prime more. If it's pure looks that matter most to you, though,
then get Hot Zone instead.

       Filled with what seems like boundless
energy, Hot Zone never stops moving. It is never a restless motion, but
the movement of an individual constantly ready to spring into action. More
than any other Autobot, he is ready for battle at a moments notice, diving
in and fighting with a warriors instinct that is second to none. Other
Autobots take inspiration from his energy, following him cheerfully into
the very heart of danger, and, thanks to his skills, always emerging unscathed.
