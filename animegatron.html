    Megatron now has an Earth
vehicle mode, and it's of an osprey helicopter! This mode is good in some
aspects, but just as bad in others. The color scheme of grey, black, and
red isn't exactly exciting, but it's spot-on classic Megatron, and it certainly
doesn't clash, so I certainly don't mind it. The transparent red cockpit
with all its molded-in circuitry looks particularly cool, and the cannon
at the front fires a spring-loaded missile if you push in on its barrel.
If you push on the transparent red Decepticon symbol on Megatron's underside,
a "helicopter taking off/hovering" sound will emit from the toy as lights
in the cockpit blink off and on for a bit. The blades of the helicopter
also look really cool and sharp (though they're not, of course). Unfortunately,
you can't spin them via a button or anything-- you have to twirl one manually,
which will twirl the other in a slightly delayed rotary gimmick. Given
how big the propellers are, though, and how the blades can smack against
each other pretty easily in the center, this is pretty darn lame. There's
also two really obvious robot mode extras in this mode. Although folded
up, his entire robot arms are REALLY obvious underneath his wings in this
mode, and his feet are also obviously the rear end of this mode. Megatron
has three landing gear in this mode, though only the rear two are retractable--
the one under his gun is "permanent".

    Megatron has an exceedingly
simplistic transformation for a Leader-class toy-- you do something inventive
with the lower legs that involves them folding over other parts, but otherwise
it's a mostly "stand me up, take my gun off, fold my vehicle parts back"
transformation. Also as you push his cockpit back during the transformation,
a classic "G1" transformation sound is emitted from the toy along with
the typical blinking lights, but it's very easy to activate multiple times,
and can get rather annoying. Megatron's robot mode is where most of the
toy's strengths lie. The proportions are spot-on perfect, and although
some helicopter extras are obviously present-- like part of the wings and
the cockpit-- they fold up behind his back rather nicely and keep out of
the way. The detailing, though relatively sparse as is the Animated style,
is still great where used, such as the robot head, which looks really nice,
and is a lot more "G1-y" than
    <a href="anicybmegs.html">
     Cybertron Mode
Megatron's
    </a>
    Movie-esque head. I also love all the red transparent details
on his chest, which look especially great when you activate his electronics.
Megatron has great articulation, as well-- he can move at the neck, shoulders
(at four points), elbows, wrists, hips (at two points), knees (at two points),
and a bit at the ankles, as well. He is a bit back-heavy because of the
aforementioned vehicle mode extras, however, which keeps him from being
as posable as he otherwise would be. His shoulders don't peg into anything,
and can slide outwards a bit to their vehicle mode position a little easily,
which can get a bit annoying. As far as gimmicks/weapons go, Megatron has
some pretty cool ones. For one, his cannon from vehicle mode can he attached
to either arm (though if you want to keep it show-accurate, put it on the
right arm), and it holds on pretty well. His blades also come off and fold
to become very cool-looking swords-- quite an inventive idea, there. By
pressing in on the transparent red Decepticon symbol on Megatron's appropriately
broad, wide chest, red lights will blink in his chest and head, his mouth
will open and close as you push in/out the button, and he'll say one of
three things-- either "Crush the Autobots!" "Where is the AllSpark!?",
or he'll laugh eeeevilly. In addition, if you have
    <a href="anileadbulkhead.html">

    , you can fit the Headmaster unit can fit over Megatron's head--
though it doesn't change his electronics, sadly.

    Leader class Megatron's
robot mode is just all-around excellent and cool-looking and he has excellent
gimmicks though his transformation is really simplistic for a Leader class
toy and his vehicle mode could be better. Mildly recommended, though honestly
this is my least favorite of the Animated Leader class figures. If you
want only one version of Megatron and don't care about show accuracy, I'd
get the much cooler-looking

      Now that he has finally been able to
build a body for himself, Megatron is more powerful than ever, and no force
on Earth can stand against him. He is a fighter without equal anywhere
in the universe. Backed up by his Decepticon soldiers, he is also an expert
battle leader, without peer. He is as ruthless as he is ambitious. Megatron
will stop at nothing to gain the AllSpark, and destroy Optimus Prime and
his Autobots.
