     Evac's vehicle mode is
reasonably accurate to his larger version, with a few important differences.
For one, a normal shade of yellow is used on LoC Evac, while his "normal"
version has a kind of "cheesy" orange color instead. Second, his propeller
has only two blades, while the larger version has four. No doubt this was
so that the propeller wouldn't break too easily-- already it feels rather
flimsy-- so I can't blame the designers for doing this. (In fact, good
thing the propeller is removable, since otherwise I could see it snapping
in half during transformation.) The propeller rotates on its axis, but
it doesn't spin by itself-- you have to push it along by hand, it doesn't
move freely at all. The Cyber Key-activated cannons are also always deployed
in the LoC version, but obviously at this scale they can't fire, nor can
the side-mounted winch work either. What I'm really not fond of is the
back half of the main body of the helicopter, however-- it doesn't look
at all like an actual part of the 'copter, given that, first off, it's
a different color, and secondly, there's noticable gaps in between several
parts, so that you can see right through some parts of the back half. It's
a bit too obvious from this construction what parts are made from Evac's
robot upper legs and shoulders, whereas this is not the case on the larger
version. Another more minor quibble is that Evac's mold detailing is rather
lackluster-- most of his structure is too smooth and undetailed when compared
to the other LoC figures. The paint detailing is pretty good, though, especially
the white and red on the tail.

     Evac's robot mode, sad
to say, got the short end of the stick when it was downsized. Unlike on
the larger version, the robot legs reach far too high up proportionally,
to the point where Evac has very little of an actual chest-- there's not
much space at all between his head and his waist! The arms also could use
more paint detailing to make them look more accurate to the larger version,
though the paint detailing on the head is pretty good. Evac's articulation
is good in the legs, with ball joints and swivel joints at all the necessary
places (including the waist), but his arm articulation is practically non-existant-
he can rotate his arms at the elbows/shoulders (it's hard to tell, he doesn't
really seem to have any elbows on this version), but that's it. It's also
a bit of a shame that Evac's cannons on his back can't fold down onto his
shoulders, it only would have required two more pieces of plastic.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     LoC Evac's helicopter
mode is a decent miniature version of his larger self, even with its couple
of see-through holes, but his robot mode proportions really need some work,
namely his non-existant elbows on his arms and his ridiculously high-up
waist. You're probably better off paying the $20 for the larger version.
