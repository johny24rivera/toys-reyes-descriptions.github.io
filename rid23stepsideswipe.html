    Sideswipe's 3-Step Changer
version has a VERY spot-on vehicle mode. Usually some of the simplistic
changers have some minor proportional issues, but not here-- pretty much
everything's perfect. All of the angles on the car mode are there, along
with the usual fairly simplistic mold detailing. At this scale the lack
of detailing on the hood, roof, and sides is a bit much-- even just a few
more lines would've worked wonders-- but again, show-accurate. He's got
the slim, angular grill and headlight details on the front-- the grill
is painted a metallic charcoal black, while the headlights have a VERY
nice light blue paint that contrasts against the major color of dark red
pretty darned well. The charcoal black is okay, but I think a "straight"
black would've worked better. This charcoal black paint is also used on
the windows and rear spoiler. (The wheels are plastic, and are of the "normal"
black variety.) The back end also has some nice grill and taillight mold
details, but sadly none of them are painted. He does have some somewhat
metallic pale red Japanese symbols near the rear of the mode, as is accurate
to the show and complements the red a bit while adding in some more paint
detail (though making them more on the white end of the spectrum would've
looked better). The only detail that isn't accurate in this mode are the
two little bumps near the back end of the roof, which become Sideswipe's
kneecaps in robot mode (which are also painted charcoal black). Still,
they're pretty minor and look like little intake vents, so I think they're
not really a downside.

    Sideswipe's transformation
is identical to
    <a href="rid23stepbee.html">
     3-Step Bumblebee's
    </a>
    , but
up-side down, where the REAR section extends out, rotates, and is then
pushed back in again to auto-transform the rest of the toy compared to
the front section on 'Bee. It's just a solid a transformation as on 'Bee,
with everything feeling very solid and not at all cheap. The end result
has some minor proportional maladies-- the chest is a little oddly chaped,
and the legs are just a tad short proportionally-- but otherwise he looks
pretty good. He's got the nice waist and stomach details from the show,
and a pretty nice, accurate headsculpt with his "punk hairdo" helmet. The
arms are just a tad 2-D from a front view, as the arms are merely molded
onto the inside of the car doors, and the car headlights on the shoulders
are a bit inaccurate, but for a 3-step changer it's to be expected and
it still looks okay. Unfortunately, just like with 3-step Bumblebee, the
head doesn't look straight, but instead looks down a bit because the waist
doesn't QUITE shove in that last click for the transformation. Double-unfortunately
(Is that a saying? I'm making it a saying), Sideswipe's chest is constructed
like 'Bee's, so you can't simply unscrew two screws and properly reset
the head (plus it does need to flip down for vehicle mode, whereas Bumblebee's
head doesn't really need to do anything for his transformation). As for
paint exclusive to this mode, there's silver on the face and abs, that
nice light blue on the eyes and faux chest headlights, some pale gold only
on little bits on the stomach (I really wish it was used more), and some
metallic charcoal black on the lower arms and waist. (The charcoal black
is rather unneeded because it's surrounded by black plastic-- gimme more
of that light blue instead, Hasbro!) For articulation, Sideswipe can only
move back-and-forth a bit at the elbows. It's not much, but that's about
average for a 3-step changer, since the point of these is not articulation
but large simple-to-transform toys.

    Sideswipe is largely
a pretty solid 3-step changer, with a great transformation, a near-flawless
vehicle mode, and a pretty nice robot mode as well, given the gimmick.
His arms are a touch weak, and I really wish his head could look straight-forward
and he had a few more points of articulation, but given the age this size
class is aimed at, this is one of the better ones. Recommended the most
out of the simple RID2015 Sideswipe toys.
