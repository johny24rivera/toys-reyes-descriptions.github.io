    Hulk smash, but Hulk
tank smash better! Hulk have to thank Iron Man and Stretchy Guy for making
Hulk Tank for Hulk... Anyway, Hulk really like tank mode-- nice detailing,
and looks like it make lots of booms! Panel detailing all over, especially
on treads, which Hulk especially like. Even battle damage on front! Using
gold and dull blue to accent Hulk's natural green also make for good color
scheme, Hulk think. Hulk does have two complaints about Hulk's tank mode,
though-. First, tank has no real back! Hulk can see robot waist right there,
plain as day! Plus, turret can't rotate! How Hulk supposed to smash things
that attack him from side!? GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!

    As good as Hulk think
Hulk's tank mode is, Hulk's robot mode even better! Since Hulk already
on subject, though, Hulk cover the few things he NOT like about robot right
off bat. First, Hulk's head look like Frankenstein! Hulk not THAT old yet!
Second, tread panels on bottom of arm tend to come off pegs easily, and
some other tread panels on lower arms not peg into anything-- that probably
Hulk's biggest thing that makes Hulk mad about Hulk tank, in fact. Other
than that, though, Hulk LOVE robot mode! Good proportions, make Hulk look
big and beefy with huge shoulders, like Hulk really is! Hulk also love
chest design-- beefy and with rivets, Hulk really like! Hulk also not really
have any big tank extras, big plus! Hulk also have really good artc-- articl--
movement. Hulk can move at neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows, wrists,
at base of thumb, at two points along four fingers of each hand (which
are each one piece), hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles!
That lot of movement, Hulk can get into lots of cool smashing poses to
smash stuff in Hulk tank! Hulk can also turn at waist, but then Hulk snap
back into original position, because of stupid "super punch" gimmick that
not really work well.

    Hulk love Hulk tank--
though not quite perfect, Hulk think it definitely best of first wave of
Marvel Transformers, with really neat robot mode! Hulk-- and Beastbot--
highly recommend!

      This mech suit was built specifically
to match the power and rage of the Hulk. Its armor is indestructible, like
the shield of Captain America. Its hydraulic joint flexors absorb the HulkÂ’s
energy, so that the battle suit becomes stronger as the Hulk gets angrier.
In vehicle mode, a powerful sonic cannon knocks other mechs to the ground,
and scrambles their audio sensors.
