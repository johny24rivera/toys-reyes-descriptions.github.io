    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original AoE deluxe
Crosshairs toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the

     The toy is named Hot
Shot, and it may bear a slight resemblance to
     <a href="cyhotshot.html">
      Hot
Shot's Cybertron form
     </a>
     in that the alt mode is a blue car-- but really,
this is an homage to
     <a href="g1tracks.html">
      Tracks.
     </a>
     Why didn't they
just call him Autobot Tracks? Beats me-- maybe they think it's too likely
they'll use that name for a character actually in the movies in the future?
Regardless, Hot Shot's main colors are a dark blue and various shades of
dark gray/black. The dark blue is a pretty nice shade of the color, having
a little glitter in the mix-- not quite enough to make it look outright
metallic, but just enough to make it pop a little. The dark blue plastic
and paint match each other perfectly, so no worries there. The clear plastic
is tinted this time, which works better with Hot Shot's generally darker
color scheme-- plain clear plastic would've looked a bit ugly with all
the dark colors on this toy, and the tinted plastic helps hide some of
the robot parts behind the windows in car mode. Most of the black and dark
milky gray is on the robot parts, with the dark gray making up much of
Hot Shot's legs, waist, and upper arms. The legs could've used a bit more
paint, but otherwise it serves as a decent neutral color for the blue to
play off of. The black is mostly reserved for the feet/front grill, the
guns, and the wheels-- I would've preferred the black in place of the dark
gray in robot mode given the greater contrast, but this is a minor quibble.
The best parts of Hot Shot's color scheme are definitely the red and white
paint apps used on parts of his robot mode-- namely, the red on his lower
arms and the white on his shoulders and crotch. They really contrast extremely
well against the otherwise dark color scheme, and look great. That said,
the white head with a painted red face just looks weird, especially for
a "more realistic" movieverse ultra-detailed headsculpt. It doesn't look
good, and not much like either Tracks OR Hot Shot. The vehicle mode, sadly,
is basically bereft of either red or white paint apps, with only an Autobot
symbol on the hood and some gunmetal gray paint on the headlights. No paint
on the front or back bumpers at all, or on the sides-- just blue and black
(or tinted clear plastic, in the case of the windows). Given that this
is supposed to be a Tracks homage, why not some flames on the hood? SOMETHING
to make the toy stand out a bit more in car mode...

     AoE Hot Shot is an okay
redeco taken by itself, but it's not nearly close enough to Hot Shot in
terms of overall color scheme to really qualify as a "new version" of that
character, and although he looks like Tracks, he doesn't have iconic Tracks
bits like flames on the hood-- in fact, his vehicle mode looks very boring
overall, with only bits of white and red in his robot mode really saving
his entire color scheme from being rather dull. I'd recommend Crosshairs
slightly over Hot Shot, mass-release version of the former or otherwise.

       The only thing Hot Shot likes more than
winning is winning and going home a hero. The fearless Autobot will charge
into any situation, blasters firing at every target in sight.
