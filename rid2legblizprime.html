    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RID2015 legion
Optimus Prime toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Gotta get another Optimus
Prime in this size class, so time to make him the "Blizzard Strike" color
scheme that's taking the RID2015 figures by storm! Optimus' major colors
are very similar to his major colors on his
     <a href="rid2blizprime.html">
      Warrior
redeco
     </a>
     , with a moderately dark "arctic-y" blue mostly on the cab section
and the top of the trailer, and a dark navy blue on the trailer/leg section.
The two colors complement each other pretty well, but the lighter shade
of arctic blue could have stood to be a bit lighter for better contrast.
A fairly dark milky brownish gray is also used for Optimus' wheels as well
as some connector bits, like his waist, hips, and the sides of his robot
chest. Honestly this is a pretty ugly color-- dark gray by itself I don't
mind, but the brown mixed in with this just looks rather ugly, like it's
just a mix of bunch of dark plastic colors. I GUESS for the wheels you
could say it's like the wheels are covered in ashy slush similar to that
on the sides of roadways in the winter, but it's still just not that great
of a color and isn't light enough to contrast with the blues, either. I
do quite like the white paint on the upper legs and shoulders which provides
some excellent contrast in robot mode, and there's a bit of silver on the
robot faceplate. There's also some dark blue paint on the sides of the
arms, and some arctic blue paint on the knees. This helps a bit when it
comes to keeping the toy from having too large of an area of just one shade,
but the two colors again just don't contrast against each other enough
to look interesting.

     No mold changes have
been made to legion Blizzard Strike Optimus Prime.

     The legion class version
of Blizzard Strike Optimus Prime is pretty dull, overall. He definitely
looks arctic-y with his two main shades of blue, but they should've been
had better contrast between them. The brownish gray is blah, and the only
highlights of the scheme are the nice white bits in robot mode and the
silver on the faceplate. Out of the three releases of this mold, this is
my least favorite.
