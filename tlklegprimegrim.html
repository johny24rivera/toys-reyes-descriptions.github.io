       Grimlock's base color
of plastic for most of his body is the same here as on his
       <a href="tlkleggrimlock.html">
        general
retail release
       </a>
       -- a kind of dark brownish gray with some glitter mixed
in to make it semi-metallic. The light gray plastic used for his appendages
is a bit different this time, though-- in contrast to the official pics
used here, which are rather airbrushed a bit, they're actually a noticeably
duller shade. Still what I could classify as light gray, but just so, not
the nearly "pearly" gray the mass release has. It makes for less contrast,
but counteracting that-- and then some, in my opinion-- is the replacement
of glossy black paint on the original with a metallic bronze-gold paint,
used not just on the robot chest but also on the top of the fins, beast
head, and tail. It's a nice little addition to the color scheme, even if
it largely fits the same "earthy" shades as the mass release. As is fitting
for the "Cyberglyph" gimmick, Grimlock's name is spelled out in Cyberglyphs
on the right side of his back-fin. The face paint apps are the same colors
and in the same place as on the mass release.

in these stock pics).

         If Grimlock wasn't a
big change, Optimus here is even less so from the
         <a href="tlklegprime.html">
          mass
release
         </a>
         . All of the base plastic colors are the same-- black in the
same places, dark milky blue in the same places as well. Most of his silver
is also in the same place, though some more has been added to the stomach
and upper legs, helping to break up all that blue a titch more. The red
paint apps are also changed a little-- the flame apps on the sides of his
truck mode are smaller, but the flame apps on his truck nose slightly more
extensive, with "Prime" written in blue Cyberglyph in said flames (small
enough you'd be forgiven for not noticing it-- it doesn't look like the
stock photographer did, given the angle of the vehicle mode image). Oh,
and the Autobot symbol has been moved from his left leg to his right lower
arm, for some reason. Still pretty much the same with a similar vibe.

         <font face="OCR A Extended">
          This Legion 2-pack not
only uses the wrong designs for both of the characters (still), but the
changes are too minimal to really warrant another purchase for all but
the most diehard completists (Optimus in particular). Both of these molds
have also been released a ton already, and in better colors, too. Generally
there's just no need for this pack and it's best ignored, even if the individual
toy molds themselves are alright for the size.
