    Activator Starscream's
jet mode, from a top-down view, doesn't look so bad. Of course, as is befitting
the age range the subline is targeted at, Starscream's proportions are
a bit chibi-fied, with smaller wings, a larger nosecone, and a much larger
main body of the jet. However, the shape still hearkens to an F-22 Raptor
quite well. All of Starscream's wonderful "tattoo" paint detailing is on
this mode, along with the usual mold details you'd find on a jet like this.
However, when not looked at from directly above, it's blatantly obvious
Starscream has his entire robot mode as the undercarriage for this mode,
and it's a pretty big, thick undercarriage. However, at least everything's
folded up underneath the outline of the jet, with nothing jutting out and
making the undercarriage junk even more obvious (with the exception of
bits of the hands and lower arms).

    As an Activator, to
transform Starscream to robot mode you simply push in on the Decepticon
symbol in the middle of his jet mode and he'll unfold into robot mode on
his own, with only some minor tweaking with the arms and feet needed. You
do have to hold his arms and legs into a certain position to lock him back
into vehicle mode, though, so he's a tad harder to get back into that mode.
Also, the button trigger for getting him into robot mode gets stuck often
on mine, likely because of how the legs are tabbed into the undersized
of the cockpit. As for Starscream's robot mode itself, it's... it's...
hahaHAAAAAAAAAAAAAhahahah... erm... ahem... excuse me. *snirk* Well, I
    <i>

    the attempt was to make Starscream look comedical with how "superdeformed"
the toy is, and not at all threatening. Because with that hugely oversized
noggin of his and the (relatively) small and thin arms and legs... heheh.
He looks like a little kid with a Halloween costume on. Anyways, if you
ignore that huge bit, the rest of the mode is fairly good. The jet parts
tuck behind the back for the most part (though the nosecone can flop around
a bit back there). The mold detailing is quite good, particularly on the
chest and head (snicker). The paint detailing's quite impressive in this
mode too, with the tattoos placed where they're appropriate, along with
a well-detailed mouth and chest. The gold on the cockpit and the deep purple
bits on the chest contrast quite well with Starscream's generally fairly
dull color scheme, though the brown/bronze bits-- which become visible
in this mode-- help a bit with that as well. The articulation is pretty
good for an Activator as well-- Starscream can move at the neck, shoulders
(at two points), elbows, wrists (at two points), hips, knees (at two points),
and ankles. Since he's not really backheavy (the pieces on his back are
hollow and made of the bendy kind of plastic, and thus don't weigh much),
you can get him into some pretty neat poses.

    Activator Starscream
is easily the weakest of the Autobot Alliance Activators subline. Although
the mold and paint detailing-- as well as the articulation-- is pretty
good on this toy, the jet mode has the entire robot mode hanging off the
bottom, and in robot mode Starscream takes the slightly chibi nature of
the line and exaggerates it to absolutely ridiculous-looking proportions.
If you're a collector of oddities and think the look of the robot mode
has a bit of a bizarre charm, this might be a buy, but otherwise it's an
easy pass.

      There was a time on Cybertron when other
robots were afraid to take to the skies, because Starscream had claimed
them as his own. He is the master of the air. There, no one can challenge
him-- not even Megatron.
