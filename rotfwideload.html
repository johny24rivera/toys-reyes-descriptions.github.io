    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Rollbar.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge of the Fallen

     Wideload's color scheme
is a bit more reminiscent of a UPS delivery truck than his mold's predecessor's--
and the "Energon Express" logo on the sides of his vehicle mode seem to
support that that's the kind of truck he is-- it takes a few more liberties
than slavishly looking like your average delivery truck. It's sort of a
like a delivery truck that delivers breakfasts or something. Wideload certainly
has a color scheme that reminds one of a morning sunrise, with a rather
nice creamy whitish tan being his predominant color, and light orange being
a major accent color only helps that image. The bits of dark blue he has
are a great dark contrast color against all that light plastic, but I'm
not fond of the light gray. First off, it's a really bland color, but secondly
as a major color in robot mode it doesn't either mesh well or contrast
well against the whitish tan. If it was a bit darker like the silver it
really would've worked better, methinks. As far as paint apps go, Wideload
has a pretty decent amount of them, particularly in vehicle mode, with
the silver and the "Energon Express" logos helping to break up the colors.
In robot mode he's a bit sparse, though-- this is made doubly odd by the
fact that two of his paint apps were rather wasted on the light paint apps
on the inside halves of his shoulder connector pieces. Um, since those
are definitely pieces of vehicle kibble, shouldn't the purpose be to draw
attention AWAY from, not TO, them?

     RotF Wideload has a
pretty unusual, but original, color scheme that works fairly well. I think
the light gray would've been better used as a dark gray or perhaps a bit
more dark blue, but he'll definitely stand out (in a good way) on any Movieformer
shelf. Recommended over Rollbar.

       Wideload thinks about two things: doing
his job well, and looking good. So when a Decepticon scum like Sonar ruins
not only his perfect polish, but also a cargo of sensitive electronics,
he swears revenge. He doesn't know how he's going to take out the sea bound
warrior, but he's determined to sink Sonar if it's the last thing he does.
