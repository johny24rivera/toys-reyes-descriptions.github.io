    Beast mode is a transmetal
tarantula. This mode is very nice, with practically no extras. The only
major extra is the little "chainsaw" weapon that Tarantulas has- this is
stored under his mandibles. This gets in the way a bit, and makes the middle
of the tarantula head pop up sometimes. The other, less noticeable, extra
is the vehicle mode wheel under the back of the abdomen. This doesn't get
in the way, however, and actually complements the abdomen with its addition,
looking like a "spinning spinneret". The detailing to this mode is very
good, and complete with a crafted "turbo engine" on the top of the abdomen.
The color scheme for this version of Tarantulas Transmetal, however, is
a bit too drab in my opinion. There is not much color to this mode, or
the other two modes, for that matter. It is mostly just silver, gray, and
black. While the red does complement a little, it doesn't help much, and
the neon green looks odd in its placement. The color scheme makes this
'bot look more like a transmetal wolf spider than a transmetal tarantula.
Still, an incredible beast mode, though.

    Vehicle mode is merely
flipping out the wheel and chainsaw weapon under Tarantulas and pushing
his spider legs up to prevent interference. While this isn't much of a
vehicular mode, it still looks very nice, especially when complemented
by the turbo engine. This mode is a bit unstable, however, and can't stand
up very well, although the extra spider legs (which look odd in this mode)
may help a little.

    Robot mode is very good.
The most noticeable extras in this mode are the spider legs, but this makes
the mode look all the more scarier. The only other major extras are the
panel that covers Tarantulas' robot head in beast mode, and the halves
of the wheels from the vehicle mode. The head panel just looks odd and
sticks out a bit, but the wheel halves on the shoulders make Tarantulas
look a little more buff, although they are a bit wiggly. The rest of this
mode is practically flawless in its construction- the legs are nice and
pointy, the arms have little spider-like claws on the ends of them, and
the chainsaw blaster fits perfectly in its hole in the hand. Again, however,
I think the color scheme hampers the overall effect that this mode could
have had. The lime green looks odd next to the grey, and the face looks
like Tarantulas has a mustache.

    A very nicely constructed
toy, but the color scheme is slightly on the drab side, in my opinion.

      There are few Predacons spinning webs
of violence and deceit as skillfully as the eight-legged ninja warrior
Tarantulas. After the quantum surge, Tarantulas was delighted to discover
himself as a meched-out arachnid with motorcross vehicle-like capabilities.
Instead of constantly relying on stealth and surprise, Tarantulas now races
into battle on his wicked new wheels, converting into a new animalized
robot mode that makes him virtually unstoppable in battle!
