    Roadbuster's vehicle
mode is a "non-weaponized" version compared to that seen in the movie,
but it still looks darned cool. The proportions are pretty much spot-on,
as you'd expect for a vehicle mode based on a licensed car (a Chevy Impala,
in this instance). All of the decals are also based on Dale Earnheardt
Jr.'s race car, which is a bit oddly specific of a disguise, but hey, it
still looks awesome. There are no robot mode extras whatsoever in this
mode-- even with the see-thorugh windows, you can't really make out much
inside (other than that there aren't seats and a steering wheel). The dark
green and white go really well together in this mode, and they pop out
a bit from most other movie figures which generally have dull colors. All
of the logos also help to give it that authentic NASCAR look-- AMP Energy
drink and National Guard logos, as well as paint apps replicating Earnheardt's
signature above the doors. Because of all the decals and the white stripes,
Roadbuster certainly doesn't look boring here-- I honestly have no complaints
at all when it comes to this mode. As for Roadbuster's Mechtech weapon,
it's simple, but kinda pointless-- it's a gun with a chainsaw blade on
the front that, when activated, because a gun with a chainsaw blade...
further out in the front. Oooo...kay? This is honestly one of the Mechtech
weapons where I don't mind that it can't stay stuck in its "activated"
position. There are 3 Mechtech ports on Roadbuster-- one on the roof, and
one on each car door on the side. The peg holes where you push the Mechtech
weapons in also "raise up" when a weapon is not attached so that they don't
create obvious gaps in the paint apps-- something very much appreciated.

    Roadbuster's robot mode
does a pretty good job of evoking how he looks in the movie-- with a few
exceptions. For one, his side doors are merely hanging off his arms (or
visa versa, whichever you prefer), and it makes the lower arms look a little
flat in the process. Also, most of Roadbuster's vehicle roof simply hangs
down behind his back, all the way down to his knees-- it doesn't really
get in the way of articulation, but it IS a bit unsightly. Another sore
point is that most of the parts around his shoulders are loose and can
pop off rather easily-- his shoulder ball joints, the small dark green
panels in front of the shoulders, and the small translucent blue panels
on the backside. They're all easy to pop back on, but it's still worthwhile
noting. As far as his "core" robot mode proportions go, though, they're
quite good (with the aforementioned exception of the lower arms), and I
love that his chest is two-thirds of his front hood, segmented up and angled
towards each other. It makes for a pretty neat-looking chest. Having the
rear end of the car form shoulder-mounted missile pods was also an awesome
idea, and helps to give him a bit more individuality. His head is also
sculpted fairly well, and it looks like he's wearing sunglasses and a hat,
which helps to give him some character as well. The mold detailing is also
great on his robot mode with "bars of iron" detailed on his lower legs
and an insane amount of little "robot-y bits" on his waist and lower chest.
Unfortunately, a rather dull greenish gray becomes a major color in this
mode, and it simply doesn't look good (nevermind that it's boring). The
paint apps on his robot mode bits are also pretty sparse (pretty much just
his head and knees are detailed, here)-- understandable, given how many
paint apps his vehicle mode has, but still unfortunate. Roadbuster's articulation
is pretty good-- he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows
(at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles. One last thing to note
is that in additon to the Mechtech ports he has on his lower arms/car doors,
Roadbuster also has clip joints on the underside of his forearms in case
you want to armor him up with C-clip weapons.

    Roadbuster is definitely
one of the better deluxes in the DotM line, with a rock-solid vehicle mode
and a pretty nicely-proportioned robot mode with a lot of weapons and personality.
My only major issues with him are the loose shoulder bits and how far down
behind his back his car door kibble hangs in robot mode. Recommended, and
my personal favorite of the various toys of his DotM self by a hair.

      Roadbuster might be a little rough around
the edges, but he's got it where it counts. For as long as any of them
can remember, he and his partners have specialized in traveling the galaxy,
kicking Decepticon tailpipe and taking names. To them, Earth is just another
battleground.
