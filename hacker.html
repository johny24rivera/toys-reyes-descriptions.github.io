    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Power Up VT6. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of Power Up VT6

     If this mold was a real
portable game player, Hacker X-3 would be the one that all the guys would
be buying while Power Up VT6 sat on the shelves. Simply put, Hacker's color
scheme is GREAT. I've always liked black as a main color, and it works
even better on a game player, with some particularly nice metallic gunmetal
gray used on the front and back of said player. And FINALLY, Hacker actually
has a screen shot of the
     <a href="tfmovieps2.html">
      Transformers Movie video
game
     </a>
     on her screen, which certainly fits better than Power Up's Cybertron
screen capture. There's only an Autobot symbol on the corner of the screen,
though, so it looks less like a video game screen and more like a screen
cap, sadly. Hacker has the same multi-colored buttons that Power Up has
for a bit of added realism, and the display of "Hacker X-3" in the corner
almost looks like a game company logo or something, so I don't mind it.
(The Autobot symbol on the left side is a bit extraneous given the Autobot
symbol already on the game screen, though.) The blue shoulder buttons help
give a light color to this mode and add some contrast to boot. In robot
mode, Hacker has a nice mix of light gray and blue, both nice shades that
work as excellent secondary colors against the black and mix up the color
scheme a bit. The same great shade of metallic gunmetal gray is used on
Hacker's face, and the transparent blue optics certainly fit with the overall
color scheme.

     No mold changes have
been made to Hacker X-3.

     Hacker X-3 has an awesome,
somewhat original color scheme, that's improved over the somewhat gaudy
Power Up's in every way. And you gotta love that metallic gunmetal shade
of gray. Recommended over Power Up.

       According to Hacker X-3, there's no
such thing as secret information. He looks at computer security as a personal
challenge, not because he wants whatever's behind it for himself, but because
he likes to share the things he discovers with the world. The Decepticons
are fond of secrets, which bugs him, so he goes out of his way to share
their private plans with as many Autobots as possible.
