    Mold History

   : Although based off
the Super version of the same character, the Spychanger version of Scourge

    Scourge's vehicle mode
is a truck. This mode is pretty cool- black trucks with red windows have
to be- but it's definitely missing something. Say, the trailer? Somehow,
Scourge just doesn't look..right...in vehicle mode without his tanker trailer.
And those stupid feet halves sticking up from the back of the truck don't
help much either. :PÂ  Also of note is that, even though Scourge has
six "real" wheels, only four of them actually roll. The middle two are
actually molded into the pieces behind them. However, this is necessary
for the transformation, and at least they ARE real wheels, unlike on

    .

    Scourge's robot mode
is also pretty nice (which pretty much singles him out as the only really
good-looking Spychanger in robot mode). This mode is pretty dead-on accurate
with the larger Super version, and the toy even has a similar transformation
to the bigger version. His shoulders are a bit oversized, but it's not
big deal. The paint detailing on this toy really shows through in this
mode- teal detailing is everywhere in this mode, and loks really nice.
It's amazing how much detail Hasbro managed to squeeze on such a small
face. What really does hurt this mode, though, is pretty much the complete
lack of articulation. The only parts that can really move are his arms
at the elbows. His shoulders can also technically move, but this is a side
effect of the transformation and merely makes him look like he's shrugging.
As such, this really, REALLY limits Scourge's playability in this mode,
and makes him...well...boring, despite his looks.

    Although Scourge has
it in looks, he suffers quite a bit from a lack of articulation. Neat if
you like to merely sit your TFs on a shelf, but it you like to play with
them, I'd suggest the

this one.
