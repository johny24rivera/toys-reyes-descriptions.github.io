    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Animated Voyager
Lugnut. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original

     Lugnut's new "atomic"
color scheme is actually, for the most part, more realistic than his original
scheme. I mean, how many purple-and-teal bombers have you seen flying around?
Atomic Lugnut's primary color scheme is a mix of a very dark bluish black
and pale light blue. Those colors are certainly much closer to what you'd
expect to find on an aircraft. However, Lugnut certainly has some "atomic"
coloring to him-- namely, the yellowish-green that has a very "nuclear"
feeling to it that is used for his tail fins, cockpit/chest, and robot
head. He's also got some yellow "danger" stripes on his bomb-fists and
some spiffy red line detailing on his rear end and on his wings. Of course,
one of the most obvious new paint apps are the "shark mouth" decos around
the nose and sides of his cockpit, which look mighty nice. He's also got
a "nuclear symbol" deco on the back end of the plane. By now it should
be obvious that Atomic Lugnut is hardly bereft of paint apps-- he's got
quite a few, and definitely doesn't look boring, particularly in vehicle
mode (in robot mode his legs are paint-less). However, it seems like Hasbro
couldn't decided what they wanted-- a more realistic-looking deco with
stylized military markings like the shark-mouth or a green nuclear-themed
deco. It's sorta-half and half, to the point where the green sticks out
a little, and in the bad way. Used to a fuller extent, I think the green--
particularly if the transparent plastic had been light green-- could've
worked, but with this particular shade you better go all the way or don't
bother.

     No mold changes have
been made to Atomic Lugnut.

     Atomic Lugnut has a
lot of really cool paint apps, and his color scheme isn't outright bad
per se, but he seems a bit mismatched, being partially a stylized, more
realistic military deco and partially a cartoony green nuclear deco. The
green just doesn't work all that well with the other colors, though otherwise
he looks pretty nice. I'd recommend the original Lugnut's paint job over
this guy's, though.

       Exposed to malfunctioning experimental
power reactors at a remote Sumdac factory, Lugnut absorbs more power than
he can handle. Now, atomic energy spills from the cracks in his armor,
and shines from his eye. His power mace thunders with the might of an exploding
sun, while nuclear fire crackles along the edges of the footprints he leaves
behind. He's not just a danger to the Autobots-- he's a threat to Earth
itself!
