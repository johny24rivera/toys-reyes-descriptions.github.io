       Like the other "Generation
2"-painted Combaticons in this set, Blast Off has-- in typical '90s "EXTREME!"
fashion-- a completely nonsensical purple camoflauge deco. Because of all
that naturally-occurring purple, of course. What makes it even weirder
is that, contrary to normal G2 fashion, Blast Off's new color scheme otherwise
       <i>
        makes
complete sense
       </i>
       , much moreso than his traditional G1 colors-- he's otherwise
mostly white and black with some silver, the colors of an actual space
shuttle. Admittedly, these colors are a bit boring by themselves, but the
black and white do contrast against each other well enough. Still, complaints
about the weirdness of the purple camo aside, it DOES add some nice color
to an otherwise monochrome color scheme, and for that I'm quite glad of
its presence. I wish there were a few more purple camo paint apps, in fact,
particularly on the inwards-facing side of his legs or guns, which are
simply big patches of solid white. There are a few other colors on this
version of Blast Off, though both are reserved for his head-- he's got
light red eyes and a bit of periwinkle coloration along his head vents,
the latter of which in particular looks VERY nice against the white, to
the point where I wish it had been used a bit more, accuracy to the original
G2 Blast Off toy be darned.

         Poor Brawl. All the other
Combaticons get all sorts of different colors in their various releases,
but you get stuck with green every time. In fact, the shade of green on
this "G2" version of Brawl is pretty much the exact same shade of the color
used on the mass release version-- maybe a
         <i>
          slight
         </i>
         shade lighter,
but very very close. The only immediately obvious change made to this version
are the purple camoflauge paint apps, which thankfully are on a pretty
good portion of his vehicle mode, thus definitely increasing the visual
interest of the mode (though obviously not its realism-- but hey, it's
a space tank, so whatevs). His black is also on the same spots here as
on his mass release version, though the side "tread"-like details near
the front of the vehicle mode are painted purple this time, but NOT the
robot mode bits that form part of those "treads", making those latter parts
look a bit too obvious in this mode. His silver paint is a touch lighter,
and is used a little more extensively on his robot chest, which frames
his robot mode G2 Decepticon symbol nicely. (He also has a rather obnoxiously
large G2 Decepticon symbol in tank mode, in front of his turret.) His eyes
are also an orange shade now, which makes him look like he's getting angry--
appropriate for Brawl, to be sure. The price of the extra camo apps in
vehicle mode is that, unfortunately, his rear thrusters aren't painted
at all-- but given a choice between the two, I prefer the camo for visual
interest's sake.

           Onslaught's G2 color
scheme is mostly yellow this time around, with the prequisite purple camo
paint apps that are on all the toys in this set. There's also a fair amount
of purple plastic, as well-- his waist, upper legs, weapon, and most of
his arms are all purple plastic. His regular robot head is also purple,
which is a pretty interesting color for the head-- and given the "G2-ness"
of this set, it works well in this instance. There's also some black along
his wheels, combined mode head, and a few other minor parts/details. Now,
I'm not normally a fan of yellow as a main color-- and I'm still not--
but combined with the purple plastic, purple camo, and black, it doesn't
become too overwhelming in either mode, and both the black and the purple
(the latter, in particular) contrast very nicely against the yellow, making
him quite visually interesting. There's also a few accent paint apps of
silver on his chest, waist, and Bruticus head, and both his regular robot
head and Bruticus head have light red painted on the eyes, as well. They're
both nice colors, but the silver doesn't really add much, and the light
red is used far too sparsely to do anything other than make the eyes look
more "evil" and fitting for the character. About the only part of Onslaught
I would say doesn't look great in terms of the paint app/plastic color
mix is the robot waist-- having only part of the upper waist painted silver,
and black hip joints while the rest of the upper legs are purple, looks
a bit haphazard.

             Swindle's main color
for his G2-homage version is a rather magma-like shade of reddish orange
(it looks a little more red in pictures than it is in real life), and looks
well as the main "bright" color. Black is his other main color, serving
to ground the scheme in a darker shade, and of course he has the same purple
camo paint apps on his vehicle mode that his other "G2" Combaticons all
have. He does have some silver paint apps on his grill, engine, and a few
bits near the back feet, but nearly all of his paint is used on the top
of his vehicle mode. This makes that mode look fairly nice, as the purple
goes fairly well with all the other colors and there's no big space of
unpainted plastic here. Unfortunately, this also means that significant
portions of his robot mode have no paint (his orange visor and black fists
are the only robot mode-specific paint apps this toy has). His arms practically
have no paint at all, and the same with his midsection-- to the point where
they look positively prototype-ish; this is all the more of a shame given
how much mold detailing is on parts of him, like on the wheels. At least
the reddish orange is a very eye-catching color and his camo paint apps
carry over to robot mode, otherwise his robot mode would be REALLY boring.

               Vortex's main G2 color
is a rather light pastel blue, which is generally just an eye-catching
shade of the color, nevermind that it fits well with all the purple plastic
on Vortex and the purple camo apps that he shares with the rest of the
Combaticons in this giftset. He's a bit unusual among his team in that
black is more of a secondary color for him, and it's more visible in robot
mode than vehicle mode. (Blast Off is the only other one that's like this.)
The black windows and front gun look nice in vehicle mode, but I'm sorta
glad they relegated most of it to the robot bits, as a lot of black in
'copter mode would have made him a bit too dark and not given that lovely
blue a chance to shine and contrast so nicely with all his purple. Despite
having a good number of camo paint apps in vehicle mode, Vortex is NOT
relatively un-painted in robot mode, like with Swindle-- his chest details
have a nice mix of both silver and black paint on them that looks quite
cool. His optic visor is also orange just like on Swindle and Brawl, and
his fists have been painted black, as well, fitting in with his mid-arms
in terms of color. Really, the only parts of Vortex that really could use
some more paint are his blade-weapons, which are all purple-- otherwise,
he's well-covered.

                 Bruticus' combined form
is still very obviously composed of five different toys-- each of his individual
components DOES have a different major color, after all-- but the black
and particularly the purple shared between all of the Combaticons this
time around helps to tie them all together visually when they're combined
like this. The purple camo paint apps shared among all of them makes this
particularly obvious, and in my opinion, is what tips the scales into making
this version of FoC Bruticus the most cohesive overall in his combined
mode-- the most obvious that these five are supposed to go together, if
you will. Of course, he's also the most "obnoxious"-colored of the different
versions of these molds-- I mean,
                 <i>
                  purple camo paint apps
                 </i>
                 --but that's
part of the feel of G2. I will say that the way his combined mode weapon
alternates between black, white, and purple abruptly doesn't look all that
great, though, particularly since none of the individual weapons have any
paint on them to "ease" the transition.

                   The "Generation 2" FoC
Bruticus set is definitely aimed towards a specific subset of Transformers
fans-- those who don't mind wacky, nonsensical color schemes if it means
that the individual bots' color schemes stand out on a shelf. If you want
duller, more "realistic" colors, you'll definitely want to look at some
version of the
                   <a href="focsdccbruticus.html">
                    SDCC game-accurate Bruticus
set
                   </a>
                   -- but if you're a child of the late '80s/'90s and/or simply want
something that looks "so gaudy it's awesome", I'd recommend this set over
the mass-released FoC Combaticons. (If for no other reason than the price--
at $60 U.S., you're basically getting a Combaticon free, and all in one
giftset as opposed to having to hunt them down individually.)
