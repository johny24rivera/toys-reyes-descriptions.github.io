    Starscream's F-22 Raptor
alternate form is okay from a directly top-down view, but looks really
unconvincing at any other angle, due to his rather obvious undercarriage
junk. His robot legs-- and especially his robot arms-- stick out very blatantly
from the bottom and rear of this mode, with there being no real attempt
to hide the hands at all from normal view, even the aforementioned top-down
view. His robot head also sticks out from the back end, though this is
a far less obvious and annoying piece of kibble as the legs and arms. Proportions-wise,
though, this mode is alright, at least when you ignore all the kibble--
the wings, nosecone, and the like are all of the appropriate size, though
there's a ovular gap right in the middle of the jet due to Starscream's
transformation. The color scheme of light dull tan and gray is hardly attractive,
but it is realistic, which is certainly what the movie look is going for.
The silver stripes on the front of the wings and the nosecone at least
at a little bit of much-needed contrast to this mode, at least.

    In robot mode, however,
any positives Starscream had in vehicle mode are lost. He looks like a
swollen deformed tick, and just about everything that CAN be wrong with
him-- outside of the aforementioned color scheme and mold/paint detailing,
which is actually very good on his chest-- is. His arms are the goofiest-looking
part of his body by far, being a completely different shape on the upper
half than the lower half, and still looking ludicrously skinny compared
to the huge main body anyways. The feet are also too skinny (and short
proportionally, but they're supposed to be the latter). His head molding
is... I don't know what's going on with it, it's like they molded Starscream's
optics in and then weren't sure what to do with his mouth so they just
threw a bunch of random details on it, it only vaguely resembles Starscream's
actual mouth in the movie. His body is also almost paper-thin, given that
it's essentially the underside of his alternate mode you're looking at
with the limbs unfurled, and he looks really fragile from a side view,
especially since his waist and legs actually rotate backwards during transformation
and stick out from behind his main body. This was mainly done so that the
cockpit would show through the hole in his stomach to approximate his "cockpit-chest"
design in the movie, but it just looks really poorly-done here. Starscream
can move at the hips, shoulders, and elbows, and his movement is pretty
restricted at the hips, so you can't get a whole lot of poses out of him,
either. Not to mention that no matter how you pose his arms, they still
look weird....

    Legends class Starscream
is the worst of the Legends figures, and probably the worst mold to come
out of the entire movie line. He doesn't look TOO bad in vehicle mode,
if you ignore all that unsightly kibble underneath, but in robot mode he
looks absolutely ridiculous no matter which angle you're viewing him from.
Not recommended except for hard-core completists-- get the
