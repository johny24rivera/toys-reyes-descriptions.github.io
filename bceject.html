    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original TFCC Rewind
mold. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the original
TFCC Rewind toy

     Eject was the "surprise
freebie" exclusive for the 2014 subscription service, though as soon as
Rewind was revealed pretty much everyone guessed he'd be redecoed into
Eject. Although both Eject and Rewind were the same mold in G1 and obviously
thus are sharing the same mold here as well, I wish the colors had been
mixed up a bit more-- all of the paint app placements are the exact same
on Eject as they are on Rewind, with a few palette swaps done. The biggest
and most obvious one is that Rewind's black plastic has been exchanged
for a moderately dark blue on Eject, which looks a bit better to the eye
and helps separate Eject more from, say, a Rumble/Frenzy, with a more unique
shade of blue. The other change made is that all of Rewind's red has been
replaced with a bright, "safety orange" on Eject (along with some paint
apps on the inner sides of the legs). The orange looks pretty nice against
the blue and complements the gold fairly well and again, is a bit more
"individualistic". The rest of the colors and paint apps-- the pale metallic
gold, the light milky gray plastic, and the light metallic silvery blue--
are all the exact same on Eject as they are on Rewind. My opinions on these
colors generally don't change when comparing this scheme with Rewind's--
I'm not a fan of the milky gray, the light metallic silvery blue looks
good on the head, and the metallic gold is an okay shade, but I wish wasn't
as pale.

     No mold changes have
been made specifically for Eject, though he shares the same head remold
as Rewind.

     Out of the two versions
of this mold released in the 2014 subscription service, I thnk Eject is
the clear winner here. His color scheme is more unique and looks slightly
better overall, but I also think the mold-- while not a perfect fit by
any means-- works for him better than Rewind (partially because Eject doesn't
have nearly as much characterization at this point). Given that Eject is
a sports nut, him getting a more "buff" robot mode and alt mode makes sense
for his character, and the "camera" molded on the head for Rewind being
turned into a "projector" fiction-wise is a nice touch. You still have
the same downsides to this mold like the really annoying hair-trigger piledrivers
so I still think this is one of the weaker TFSS 2.0 releases, but I definitely
think this makes a better toy for Eject than TSSS 2.0 Rewind does for his
character.

       If Eject had a mouth he'd be smiling.
Standing above the players' field with the thunderous applause from the
crowd filling his audio receptors is exactly what he was built for! He
flips the switch on his head-mounted camera and an image of the games below
gluts the giant screen hanging above the arena. Soon images from overseas
games join in and the audience roars. Eject manipulates their reactions
like a grand orchestra as each play and subsequent replay garners a different
chorus.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Even as the boisterous emotion from
the crowds brings him to the brink of ecstasy, Eject can't help but feel
a twinge of sorrow deep down in his Spark. The players-- Maximals and Predacons
from all across the world-- have been forced into the games. Games that
more often than not encourage their players to fight to their death for
the sole sake of answering the age-old and half-remembered disputes between
the now-ancient Autobots and Decepticons. If Eject was still the Autobot
that he once was, he would be moved to intervene. But now, the sports are
his addiction and there is no cure.
