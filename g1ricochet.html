    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to G1 Jazz. For a review on
the mold itself, read the review of G1 Jazz

     Ricochet hasn't been
seen before on U.S. shores, so I suppose it really isn't right to call
him a "reissue" over here. But for lack of a better word, I'm going to
call him that anyways, so nyah. Ricochet is a reissue of Stepper, a redeco
of Jazz previously only available via the Japanese market. Of course, Stepper
is a stupid name, so Hasbro wisely renamed the toy here. Just don't be
fooled into thinking that it's really a bonafide U.S. G1 reissue of a character
that you just forgot about, because it isn't.

     Now, with that said,
onto the actual toy itself. The black and white on Ricochet is essentially
reversed from Jazz, and when you add in the chrome gold, this color scheme
is REALLY awesome. Love love love that chrome gold. The flame deco patterns
on the car hood and side doors also look pretty cool. I think he looks
quite a bit better than Jazz, and Jazz didn't have a bad color scheme to
begin with. Now, there are a few mold changes made to the mold, and all
of them have to do with Ricochet's Targetmaster partner, Nightstick. There's
a hole near the rear of the vehicle mode that can hold Nightstick's (rather
bulky-looking) gun mode. A small connector piece has also been added to
the set-- this piece is mounted on Ricochet's upper back in robot mode,
and you can attach Nightstick on top of this piece in gun mode so that
he's poking over Ricochet's shoulder to add even more firepower. As for
Nightstick himself, he isn't much-- in his liddl' robot mode, he can't
really move at all except for forward at the hips, and his only paint detailing
is on his face. So he's easily forgettable, and he makes a rather odd-looking
gun, too. Other than those changes required for Nightstick, though, no
mold changes have been made to Ricochet when compared to his predecessor
Jazz.

     Ricochet is a very nice,
attractive repaint of G1 Jazz, and even though his Targetmaster partner
isn't much, it's still something new. However-- even though he has just
a few more parts than Jazz, Ricochet costs $5 more than Jazz's already
ridiculously inflated price. As such, I can't really recommend him any
more than his cheaper mold brother. If you find him on a pretty good sale--
say, for less than $20-- I'd pick him up if you have a thing for G1, but
otherwise, pass.

       Fellow Autobot warriors find it difficult
to maintain friendly conversations with this quick-tempered, easily provoked
Autobot, but Ricochet has an uncommonly strong sense of justice. Has the
most accurate marksmanship of the Autobots. Can hit a tin can from 10 kilometers.
Shoulder mounted automatic shell cannon fires shots at a rate of 30 per
second.
