not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the Prime voyager Dreadwing

     Megaplex-- for better
or worse-- closely follows the color scheme of his original Machine Wars
toy, with a mostly light gray and pale bluish-green color scheme. If you've
been following my toy reviews for any real length of time, you know that
I really don't like the bland, light milky shade of gray that's used on
a lot of Transformers in place of a darker, more metallic shade of the
color that I feel would work a lot better on toys that are supposed to
be metal robots. This goes double for expensive BotCon exclusives-- having
light milky gray being such a huge portion of Megaplex's color scheme is
major turn-off for me in terms of the color scheme, regardless of how accurate
it is to the original toy. That said, the dull green does complement and
contrast against the gray pretty well, and I appreciate that it's spread
fairly evenly across the figure. For all of the "bendy" plastic, FunPub
added another badly-needed color-- a rather pale shade of blue, which complements
the bluish green excellently and looks pretty nice. There's also a very
nice shade of translucent white used for the cockpit and other transparent
plastic bits on Megaplex, and it's a very unique, nice shade-- it's pretty
much the exact shade of a particular flavor of Gatorade Frost, if you know
what I'm talking about. A fair amount of black is also used on Megaplex,
mostly for the stripe detailing on the top of his main wings and tailfins,
which helps immensely to add visual interest to the vehicle mode, Unfortunately,
this black is not painted on the underside of the wings or really given
any real presence at all in the robot mode beyond the lining around the
cockpit window. This makes the robot mode look very, very bland in comparison--
FunPub really dropped the ball here by not adding stripes to the wing undersides,
or more black paint apps or just... SOMETHING else. On the other hand,
I do like how they added the Decepticon symbols over the greenish-blue
triangles on the wings that were on the original toy, and adding this same
sort of "Elite Decepticon" symbol to Megaplex's chest makes him look important.
As one final color addition, Megaplex has a good amount of his face painted
white, which contrasts with the blue pretty well.

     Megaplex has no mold
changes-- which is real bummer, since he NEEDS a new face sculpt. Apparently
FunPub got access to the Prime Dreadwing mold rather late in the process,
and didn't have time to make a new head mold-- which, in my opinion, meant
they should have trashed the idea. The entire IDEA behind Megaplex is that
he's a clone of (Machine Wars) Megatron-- given that he doesn't have the
other usual Megatron features, having a Megatron-y face was VITAL, and
instead he's got the normal Dreadwing face, which just doesn't work for
his character. Additionally, the "Powerizer" weapon that came with the
Dreadwing mold is missing, in apparently some miscommunication with the
factory. This is a double bummer, as perched on Megaplex's arm and extended,
it could have called back to G1 Megs' fusion cannon. Combine these two
and there is literally nothing on this toy that calls back to Megatron
beyond being gray.

     Botcon Megaplex is one
of FunPub's biggest missteps in a while, especially given how central of
a role he plays in their Machine Wars set. The color scheme-- though accurate
to the original toy-- could have used more paint apps and/or something
additional to make him look less bland in robot mode in particular. The
lack of any Megatron-esque details-- such as no new head and the lack of
a fusion cannon lookalike-- are also major missteps, whether FunPub's fault
or not. As such, he just doesn't really fill the role he's supposed to
at all, and just looks like a blander Dreadwing. He unfortunately joins
his fellow boxset pal Skywarp as being one of the weakest exclusives of
2013.

       Megaplex was built by Jhiaxus as a clone
of Megatron, copying the Decepticon tyrant's aggression, cunning, and battlefield
skills into a brand new body ready for the modern age. Charged with leading
an assault against the planet Cybertron and securing the heart of Jhiaxus'
new, unified Cybertronian Empire, Megaplex uses the traits he has inherited
from Megatron with chilling efficiency as he smashes through planetary
defenses and culls the planet below.

       Megaplex must be cautious, however,
since under his armor plating he can feel Megatron billowing to the surface.
Screaming to be let free. The chaos and destruction wrought by the invasion
of Cybertron has fed the psyche once buried by Jhiaxus' tutelage, and it
may only be a matter of time until Megaplex can do nothing else but let
Megatron loose against his enemies. Whoever they might be.
