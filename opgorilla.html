    Beast mode is a gorilla.
There are no obvious hints hes a robot except for the upper back of his
legs and his arm pits. His face is kind of big proportionally, though,
and his back legs are oddly jointed. There is decent articulation in this
mode, as all his appendages can move in at least two places.

    Robot mode is very nice.
He doesnt have his prime jets as in the TV show. But, he does have rocket
launchers, two of them on his shoulders, and two of them in a pop-out compartment
on his left arm. He has two samurai swords, which he can hold in either
hand. He also has a skull club, although it looks too nasty for a Maximal.
He can thump his arms against his chest by pressing a button on his back.
He also has a mutant face, which also looks too nasty for a Maximal.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    A recommended buy. A
fair beast mode, and a great robot mode packed to the brim with weapons.

      Move over King Kong, Optimus Primal
is ready to rock! The heroic leader has biogenetically re-engineered his
body structure into a gargantuan robotic gorilla! Cybernetically fused
musculature has enhanced strength to super-powered levels. Shoulder-mounted,
mega-blast missile cannons launch devastating attacks upon foolish Predacon
invaders. When they force him to fight, they force him to win!
