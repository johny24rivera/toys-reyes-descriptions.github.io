    Crosshairs' Chevrolet
Corvette Stingray alt mode looks pretty good for its one-step changer version.
Proportionally, it's pretty spot-on-- I really don't have any complaints
whatsoever about him in this respect. There are SOME robot extras, but
none of them are that big-- the front of the robot feet are a bit obvious
on the back bumper. Additionally-- because of his transformation-- the
"seam lines" in Crosshairs' alt mode are a bit more obvious. Not enough
clips together securely enough, so some bits-- particularly the halves
of the back third or so-- can wiggle around a bit in this mode, and the
lines in between the sections of his front hood are also a bit wider than
I'd like because of this issue. As far as the colors go, this version is
pretty close to Crosshairs'
    <a href="aoepbcrosshairs.html">
     Power Battler
version
    </a>
    , with the green being a moderately light shade of forest green,
which contrasts against the black very well. The black stripes on both
sides also look really nice, though the inverse "green stripes on black"
on the back side is missing on this version (the grill also isn't painted,
either). In fact, there's a bit TOO much black on Crosshairs-- there's
no taillights painted, and having his windows painted black when they're
also partially surrounding by black parts sort of makes them blend in too
much. (The side windows are molded open, so at least there's no issue there--
there's no detailed interior, just a flat green plank o' plastic inside.
So, not as good as a detailed interior, but better than obvious robot bits
inside.) I wish they had been painted the windows silver or silvery-blue
like on the Power Battler; as it is, only the headlights are silver in
this mode, so this mode could've had a bit more color variation. I'll also
say that the Autobot symbol on the roof is juust big enough to be a bit
obnoxious (to say nothing of how it's inaccurate to the movie).

and design is identical to
    <a href="aoe1steplockdown.html">

    </a>
    ,
so many of my comments about the specifics of the robot mode are shared
between these two toys. The transformation is activated in the same manner--
by pressing in on a button on the windshield to cause Crosshairs to "split
apart" a bit into his robot mode, with you just pushing the roof piece
into Crosshairs' back to get him back to vehicle mode. Unfortunately, the
button often gets stuck and then you have to gently pull apart the parts
yourself, which is definitely a big downside given that the whole point
of these toys is that even a little kid can transform 'em. The proportions
for Crosshairs are generally good for everything except the arms, which
are a bit skinny. The vehicle kibble on the robot mode isn't really movie-accurate
at all (there's only a tiny "cloak"-detailed piece behind his upper legs),
but hey, you gotta make some sacrifices for a one-step changer gimmick.
He's
got halves of his car sides and front grill hanging off his arms and shoulders,
but they enhance his silhouette a bit even if they're not movie-accurate,
so I don't mind them. The car roof on his back does stick out a bit, but
it doesn't look TOO bad, and given how many 1-step changers have proportional
issues and this one doesn't primarily because of the transformation, I
can't get too bothered about this issue. Unlike the vehicle mode-- which
has fairly minimal mold detailing because of how sleek the Stingray is--
Crosshairs' robot bits have an impressive amount of intricate mold detailing.
Pistons, pieces of "car armor", the fake headlights on the chest, all the
intricate detailing on the chest, amrs, and head-- it's all pretty movie-accurate,
with Crosshairs having his signature slight scowl molded on his face (really,
all his headsculpt is missing is a toothpick in the mouth to be perfect).
There's a bit of silver on the chest and his head is well-painted, but
otherwise his robot pieces are devoid of paint, which is particularly inaccurate
on the legs-- I wish a few more bits of silver were added, here. For articulation,
Crosshairs can move back-and-forth at the elbows, and that's it. Disappointing,
even considering how these toys aren't made to be super poseable.

    1-Step AoE Crosshairs
definitely has his drawbacks-- parts that wobble a little in vehicle mode
is the biggest one, along with some movie-inaccurate kibble in robot mode,
VERY limited articulation, a trigger button that doesn't always work---
but as far as this subline goes, this is one of the better designs, with
no real major proportional issues in either mode. Recommended over the
Power Battler if you want a simpler Crosshairs design.
