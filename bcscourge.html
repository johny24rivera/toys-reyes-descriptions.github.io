    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Sideways. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Sideways

     As far as mold homages
go, Cybertron Sideways' serves fairly well for Scourge. It's rather "pointed"
and "edgy" while still having a rather regal look (particularly in robot
mode) what with the detailing lines and all. The alt mode is also a fair
approximation, being a flat futuristic spacecraft, though no longer is
he a flying soap dish-- he has actual wings now (not that I'm complaining,
but it IS a bit harder to see the toy as Scourge in vehicle mode). The
main blue used is a very nice shade-- a bit of a "creamy" shade, not too
dark and not too light. It's definitely a "Scourge-y" color, but it's not
quite as light as his G1 toy, which I think was a good decision-- it allows
the silver and white to contrast against it considerably better, which
I think looks great. The transparent red plastic is also gorgeous, and
makes Scourge look pretty darn evil in vehicle mode where the cockpit windows
are his "eyes". He's also got quite a lot of silver paint detailing everywhere
so he doesn't look too plain anywhere, though I do wish there was a bit
more red paint and less silver, just to mix things up a bit more. Also,
though Scourge's Cyber Key gimmick still activates his arm-blades, there
are no faction symbols inside that little visible square on the middle
of that piece on the back of his left arm, so there aren't any new symbols
that show up when you activate his gimmick or anything.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Scourge has a new head
mold, which is very accurate to his G1 persona but with a smaller "forehead
light", due to space constraints. That in itself I don't mind, but his
head is TEENY tiny because of space limitations in vehicle mode. I understand
why it was done, and it's well-detailed and painted, but it still doesn't
change the fact that it's REALLY small. The Cyber Key is the same, but
it's been painted into Scourge-y colors with the Decepticon symbol de-emphasized.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Botcon 2009 Scourge
is a pretty cool exclusive with a nice choice for the mold. It's not perfect--
I would've preferred maybe one more color in there and, as mentioned, his
remolded head is way small-- but other than that it's superbly done with
great colors on an already great mold. If you have the money for Botcon
exclusives and are looking at some, I'd mildly recommend this one, though
I think Cybertron Sideways' colors are the best this mold's going to get.

       Born from the wreckage of fallen Decepticons,
Scourge is a merciless warrior without fear. He is often seen following
the lead of Cyclonus, but internally he is constantly calculating new ways
to maneuver the Decepticon Empire towards greatness through his service.
While loyal to the Decepticon cause, there is no one he will not defy if
he feels there is a better way to bring destruction upon the Autobots.
Scourge is a tracker by nature, using his vast array of detection equipment
to find his prey. Once found, he has an arsenal of weaponry at his disposal
to destroy his targets including disintegration beams, acid rays and tractor
beams. Scourge leads "The Sweeps," a tactical unit comprised of battlefield
specialists who serve as extensions of his will. Scourge's only weakness
is his arrogance.
