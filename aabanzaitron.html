    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Revenge of the Fallen Voyager
class Bludgeon. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Revenge

     Banzaitron here is a
bit of an homage to the G1 character of the same name, and the only
     <a href="bcbanzaitron.html">
      non-exclusive
homage
     </a>
     of him to date. Given that the original version of Banzaitron
was an action master, the alt mode of a tank--and his general robot mode
design as well-- isn't really an homage so much as the general color scheme
and the samurai-like theme and look of the mold. Since the original Banzaitron
had a pretty cool color scheme, it carries over quite well to this updated
version of him. The very dark bluish green-- so dark it's almost black--
serves as a nice base color against which Banzaitron has a number of relatively
light colors like light green, pale purple, and milky gray. The milky gray
is pretty blah and honestly I would've preferred either black or the purple
in its place, but the other colors look very good against the each other--
particularly the light green, which helps to make the tank mode pop visually
despite it being an accent color. The copper is also a great-looking color,
particularly in robot mode where, along with the silver, it helps him look
a bit more like he's covered in samurai-esque armor. I wish a few more
of those paint apps had been used in tank mode, however, as he is a bit
relatively bereft of paint apps there, the distinct bits of light green
aside. (It's particularly distracting on the treads, which due to the plastic
layout of the toy, are four different colors!) The upside of this, however,
is that he's quite colorful in robot mode, with everything meshing together
quite well-- except the head. The head isn't remolded from Bludgeon's at
all, and that head is SOOOO distinctly Bludgeon's (who else has a face
resembling a skull wearing a samurai helmet?). It looks very odd, painted
red and purple as it is, when a simple head remold would've really helped
to sell this figure that much more here.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Autobot Alliance Banzaitron
is a pretty nice redeco of an excellent mold, with most of the colors going
together extremely well-- particularly the light green and copper against
the dark, dull bluish green used as the base color. Even the milky gray,
which is boring, doesn't outright clash. However, with no mold changes
made, this mold is still very distinctly Bludgeon-- there's no getting
around it. I like the color scheme better than Bludgeon (despite it being
more unrealistic) and, as a toy, recommend this slightly more. That aside,
as an homage it falls a bit short in robot mode, and gets a little bit
taken off its score because of it.

       Decepticon Banzaitron is a master of
at least seven different martial arts for one reason, and one reason alone--
his fighting skills allow him to easily defeat and dismantle his opponents.
Then he gathers up the pieces and sells them to the highest bidder. No
one's parts are worth more than the Autobot leader's. He looks forward
to commanding the highest prices imaginable for even the smallest piece
of Optimus Prime.
