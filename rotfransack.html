    Hooray! At long last,
a biplane Transformer! And in vehicle mode is looks very good, too-- surprisingly
believable proportions, given that it turns into a robot. The cockpit seat
could be a little bigger, and the robot arms are a LITTLE on the obvious
side on the underside of Ransack's wings. That's really all the negatives
that I have to say about his design in this mode. It's quite amazing the
detailing that's gone into this mode, from the little bolts 'n such on
the exposed engines to the tanned "leathery" look of the wings to the spinning
propeller (though you have to spin it yourself, there isn't a gimmick that
allows it to spin by cranking something else up or anything). The color
scheme is pretty realistic for a biplane, too, being a mostly rather dull
brown/tan/gray coloration with some nice metallic highlights where they
need to be on the engine and main body. The bright red stripes on the tail
also help to give it a bit more "zazz". Ransack also has landing gear,
though just like with biplanes, they can't retract.

    Ransack's robot mode,
on the other hand... well, let's just say that it's clear the vehicle mode
took priority when it came to the design. Part of Ransack's "skinny robot
mode with lots of vehicle mode parts" look is to make him seem old and
clunky, while I'm sure another large part of it had to do with getting
a Transformer to become a believable biplane. However, visually Ransack
is just a mess and doesn't really work all that well in this mode. His
arms are ridiculously skinny, his chest sticks out a bit and he has a tiny
"engine cap" head (which is either goofy-looking or charming, depending
on your viewpoint-- I go with the forme), and his legs are skinny with
more vehicle parts hanging off of them. The vehicle parts sort of form
a "skirt" on his hips, which is alright I guess, though his tailfin makes
for some pretty weak-looking feet. A lot of stuff seems to collide in particular
around his torso-- you've got the wing bits that form the sides of it colliding
with the landing gear (which really don't go anywhere), then there's the
propeller that'll keep getting in the way of the aforementioned landing
gear parts and the waist and skirt pieces to boot. And his head, skinny
as it is, does a bad job at covering up some of the "holes" visible in
his upper chest in this mode. I do like how the wings partially collapse
and hang off his back like insect wings, though, and putting his double-barreled
machine gun and cluster bombs on his wrists is definitely a good placement
for his weapons. Ransack's articulation is fairly good in theory-- he can
move at the neck (at two places), shoulders, elbows, waist, hips, knees,
and ankles (at two points). Unfortunately, because of Ransack's aforementioned
problem of pieces bumping into everything, in reality his articulation
can get a bit restricted around the waist and legs.

    Ransack certainly has
kitsch value at being a biplane Transformer, and one that has a really
nice vehicle mode at that with an excellent color scheme and detailing.
Unfortunately, it seems that all the design effort went into his vehicle
mode, leaving his robot mode an overly cluttered, badly proportioned mess.
If you're going to get him, get him because of the novelty of having a
biplane Transformer-- but don't expect to be wowed by the engineering in
robot mode.

      Back in the distant past of Cybertron,
when flight was a new technology, Ransack was first of the flying aces.
He was a ruthless combatant, blasting his opponents out of the sky, and
then strafing the helpless troops stuck on the ground without cover. He
may be past his prime and equipped with outdated weapons now, but there
was a time when Ransack was the most feared name on Cybertron.
