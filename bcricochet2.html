    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Cybertron Crosswise. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Cybertron Crosswise

     Ricochet, who's traditionally
been a Jazz repaint, gets the same treatment in the mirror-verse, apparently.
Though, he doesn't have at all the
     <a href="g1ricochet.html">
      traditional
     </a>
     "reverse Jazz" color scheme of mostly black with some white-- rather, it's
a completely new color scheme, being red and black with some white. It
looks pretty good, if not quite as cool as the original G1 scheme what
with the lack of gold flames and all. Still, I can see why they went for
something different than the traditional Ricochet colors, given both the
whole "mirror verse" thing plus the fact that a lot of other exclusives
this year were primarily black, AND this mold was already released in a
primarily black color scheme. The colors all contrast with each other very
nicely-- particularly the white and dark red, that's a nice and somewhat
original color combo. I do like the white stripes down the center and sides
of the vehicle mode, but overall I feel like Ricochet could use a bit more
"oomph" to his color scheme, maybe a bit more variety besides just the
three primary colors. A few isolated spots of metallic silver and dull
yellow-orange just don't quite cut it, in my opinion.

     No mold changes have
been made to Botcon Ricochet. Of note is that in addition to being a Botcon
2008 exclusive, Ricochet was only available ("free") if you bought the
expensive preregistrant Primus package AND picked the set up in person
at the convention-- so this toy is no doubt going to be worth quite a lot
of money.

     Ricochet is a fairly
good repaint, even if his colors could stand to be a bit more varied and
less "good Autobot-y". I'd say he's about on par with

     -- i.e. good, but not as good as the mass-released versions of
this mold.

       Ricochet, the twin brother of Autobot
Jazz, is the result of Prime's experiment in splitting an Ember in two
and joining each with a new body. Though Ricochet and Jazz were activated
seconds apart, the two couldn't be more different. Trained by Prime to
serve as one of his elite bodyguards, Ricochet is known for his wild attitude,
acting first and asking questions later. Many times this leaves the Autobots
without a hostage or serves to eliminate anyone who plans to usurp Ricochet
and take his position by Prime's side. Ricochet works extra hard to betray
others first, believing that those around him are out to sabotage him.
Much to his annoyance, his twin brother Jazz has always been Prime's favorite.
Though Ricochet only "acts" crazy from time to time, some fear that this
knowledge will lead to it no longer being an act.
