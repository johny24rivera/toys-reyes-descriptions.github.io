Minicon, Clench. He has the same main color, black, although on Caliburn,
much of it is a weird kind of bluish "light" black. I think a solid black,
like that used on his upper legs and arms, would have worked better for
the whole body. The sky blue cannons also don't look quite right in contrast
with the other colors, although at least none of his other parts besides
the cannons are blue. The gray wheels work great with the rest of the color
scheme, though, as do the gold paint apps on Caliburn's chest and waist.
(Caliburn is a weird name, though. What, is this guy addicted to exercise
or something?) It's also nice to see some paint apps, like the white on
the optics, used only here and nowhere else on either Caliburn or Megazarak.
It just seems to show the care that went into picking the color scheme
for this toy.

      Caliburn is a rather
nice repaint, but due to his oddly bluish black plastic used for parts
of his body, as well as his sky blue cannons, I'd have to put him a little
below Clench in my book.

        Megazarak has a really
kickin' color scheme, and one that's definitely worthy of a Decepticon
leader. He has your classic evil black-and-red combo, with a few other
colors thrown in to spice things up. He's got plenty of silver, especially
on his chest (the people who chose the colors said they did it as a throwback
to G1 Megatron), and a few varying degrees of black plastic on his body.
He still has that odd bluish black plastic on him. I don't know why that's
been used so much in Transformers lately, since just plain black looks
much better. Still, it's not too bad. I'm not sure I like the sky blue
parts, though- they don't seem to fit in with the rest of Megazarak's color
scheme. It's like they were just thrown in at random, and that's not what
ANY part of an OTFCC exclusive toy should look like. Still, his color scheme,
overall, easily lets one overlook these minor flaws. Megazarak looks like
he could kick some butt and then some.

       <br/>
       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        No mold changes have
been made to Megazarak, although his electronics have been removed. This
is both a positive and a negative; although he doesn't make all those annoying
noises when he transforms, he doesn't make any cool cannon-firing noises,
either. Still, if this is what they had to do to make Megazarak cheaper,
than I'm all for it.

       <font face="OCR A Extended">
        Megazarak is a great
repaint of a great toy- the best colors out of any of the Armada Megatron
schemes. However, for the hefty price he's got going for him, you might
wanna consider the original Armada Megatron if you only want one version
of this toy, since he's almost as good. If you don't mind paying high prices
for great toys, though, then I highly recommend him.

          The sudden appearence of Megazarak on
Cybertron's political and military landscape shifted the planet's balance
of power forever. This new warlord had a thirst for destruction and chaos
unlike any other Decepticon leader before him. With no tolerance for weaker
species, Megazarak went on a genocidal rampage throughout Cybertron, beginning
with the Destruction of his reality's Matrix-bearer. The remains of the
Autobot army were soon dispatched with ruthless efficiency and in a short
period of time, Megazarak became the most feared despot throughout the
galaxy. In both modes, Megazarak fires a wide variety of lethal electromagnetic
attacks from his side-mounted cannon. His Micromaster partner, Caliburn,
doubles as a lightning blaster - discharging 60 kilovolt bursts at his
opponents, Although immensely powerful, Megazarak does have a weakness
- his preoccupation for hunting down the remaining Autobot who had eluded
his wrath - Defensor.
