    Icepick's alt mode is
a snowmobile, complete with two rear-mounted guns to give him a bit of
firepower. Proportion-wise, this mode is pretty good-- the front end is
a TAD bulky due to the curled-up robot legs that make up its sides, but
other than that this is a pretty solid mode, with no other extras beyond
the obvious robot feet on the sides, and even that's not a big deal. His
overall color scheme of white and black is certainly fitting and works
well for a snowmobile, though the accent colors really make it. The bronze
used for the tread interior, the transparent purple used for the headlights
and windshield, the purple "FreCon" symbol on the sides, the bluish silver
and gold stripes along the front end of the vehicle-- all of them help
to give him a bit more variety and contrast well with their surroundings.
That said, the upper back end is nearly devoid of paint apps, and it could
really use some. The mold detailing is a bit hit-and-miss with some parts
(like the treads) being exquisitely detailed, while others (such as the
top rear end) are a bit minimal, even considering the slim, sleek look
a snowmobile is supposed to have. The back two gun-weapons are each on
C-clips, and thus can be used on other applicable parts on the figure (such
as the front bumper) or on other figures with those kind of mounting points.
Icepick's human partner Sergeant Chaos isn't anything to write home about--
he just looks like your average military guy in snow gear, and has all
the same articulation as any normal human partner figure in this subline.
I do like his face mask, though-- it makes him look more evil, somehow.
His hands (or the hands of another Human Alliance human figurine) fit snugly
around Icepick's handlebars, but I wish there was some sort of indentation
on Icepick's seat to give him a place to rest firmly there.

    Icepick's weapon mode
is a bit weak, even for this subline. You literally take his treads, rotate
them out in front of the vehicle, and them split them in half. This is
his "chainsaw weapon" mode. Granted, the inverted treads is a pretty cool
idea, but the rest of his vehicle mode is just... back there. Not even
really attempting to try for anything else coherent in this mode. The less
said about this mode, the better.

    In robot mode, the first
thing that sticks out for Icepick are his odd proprtions. His arms-- formed
from the halves of his seat in vehicle mode-- are really overly skinny,
and look odd, particularly since he can't easily hold his guns. His "handle
piece" that allows him to be handled by larger Transformers in weapon mode
also hangs off his left arm unceremoniously. His legs are a bit on the
slender side, but not that bad themselves-- it's the fact that his hips
jut out so far from his sides that is disconcerting. The front skis from
vehicle mode also have absolutely nowhere to go here, and just sort of
fold up to the front of his chest in a really ineffective, ugly manner
that can also restrict arm movement some. In addition, I'm not sure WHAT
his face is supposed to represent-- there's no discernable eyes, just a
large visor with a bunch of lines going through it for some reason. This
all said, the front of his vehicle mode does make for a nice chest, and
the halves of his chainsaw-treads work to effectively "frame" his shoulders,
even though they don't actually tab into place anywhere. As for Icepick's
articulation, he can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows,
hips (at two points), knees (at two points), and ankles. However, his feet
are a bit small proportionally, and with his backpack it means he can't
strike quite as many poses as you'd think he'd be able to with that kind
of movement.

    Icepick w/ Sergeant
Chaos is definitely one of the weaker Human Alliance deluxe figures. Icepick's
vehicle mode is pretty cool and well-done, but his weapon mode is an unfortunate
sidenote and his robot mode is very oddly-proportioned and just generally
odd-looking all around.

      Icepick dislikes humans intensely, but
with his combiner team destroyed, he is desperate for an effective partnership.
Rogue soldier Sergeant Chaos more than provides, offering Icepick intelligence
on Autobot targets in exchange for a chance to go along on a destructive
ride.
