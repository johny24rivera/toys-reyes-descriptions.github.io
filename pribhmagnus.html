not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime "Robots

     Unlike his
     <a href="primagnus.html">
      original
Prime version
     </a>
     , this version of Ultra Magnus is a fairly extensive remold
of Optimus Prime-- as fits Magnus' model in the show, which presumably
wasn't an entirely new model because of budgetary reasons. Nearly all of
the remolding done is done primarily for Ultra Magnus' robot mode. First
and most obviously he has a new headsculpt, which is spot-on to the show
and has the appropriate stoic look on his face, with a nice dark blue paint
app on his central headcrest with a nice red "jewel" in the center and
a silver face, all of which looks great. The robot shoulders have also
been lengthened, with missile launchers near the top-- the tops of the
shoulder missile launchers can move forward-and-back slightly, though having
the missiles in their slots restricts this movement. There are little clip-holders
for the missiles on the sides of the missile launcher pieces if you don't
want to load him up, though. The robot chest has also been re-done, with
details to make it look much more like Ultra Magnus' traditional chest
design, complete with a red stripe running across it and even a little
extra piece that folds out below it for the robot mode. The biggest mold
change, though, is a rather extensive winged backpack that is not unlike
     <a href="pribhprime.html">

voyager Beast Hunter Optimus'
     </a>
     backpack-- this one, though, can be detached
in either mode. (Each section of two wings can rotate up-and-down at one
point and out at one point; the two wings on each side can't move independently.)
There's also clips on the sides of two of the wings to give you another
option of where to store Magnus' two missiles. The backpack section is
very well-detailed in terms of the mold, with little things like coils
and exhaust ports visible. Additionally this mold's original "Powerizer"
weapon and sword have been scrapped and replaced with the "Forge of Solus"
hammer, which is detailed quite like the show but rather undersized considering
how huge the thing is in the show. This all looks nice in robot mode, but
in vehicle mode unfortunately it makes the back half look like a mess.
The big backpack stuff doesn't really fit in with the back half of the
vehicle mode at all, though at least it pegs in securely back there; the
worst offenders are the added shoulder pad-launchers, which just sort of
angle out behind the main portion of the truck cab and look incredibly
awkward and out-of-place. Magnus' chest remold also means that his front
windows are almost entirely covered by a red bar-- making it hard to make
a driver see if one's inside him! On a lesser note, though, the sides of
the nose of the truck have been remolded slightly to give Magnus some 5mm
ports in this mode to hold compatible weapons if you want to pump him up
even more.

     Ultra Magnus' color
scheme is very much by-the-book, being primarily blue with some dark blue
and red and a lot of light gray. Unfortunately, this definitely isn't the
toy that pulls off the Magnus color scheme the best. The light gray is
that very blah, milky gray that is just incredibly boring and should have
been a more metallic-looking shade. The light blue is also rather flat
and should have been just a touch darker; as widespread as it is, it just
doesn't contrast well enough with the light gray. The dark blue-- mostly
on Magnus' vehicle roof and windows-- is so dark it looks too close to
the black on his wheels, and I would have preferred that it had been replaced
with Magnus' signature white and/or red, the former of which is missing
completely from this toy. The red accents on his shoulders, chest, and
lower legs look great, however, and I wish they had been used a bit more.
This is particularly the case with his backpack, which is almost entirely
that unpainted blah light gray (only the head of the hammer is painted
silver). The silver paint on places like the sides of his vehicle mode
goes great against the blue, however.

Ultra Magnus is a great toy--in robot mode. I appreciate the added big
flight-pack and hammer (undersized as it is), and the extent of the remolding--
however, it all ends up being a bit of a mess in vehicle mode. This version
of Magnus' color scheme is also "off" slightly, particularly with how light
the main color of blue is, and all that light milky gray isn't doing him
any favors, either. If you want a show-accurate Ultra Magnus, this is the
best version you can get, though-- as bad as some parts of his vehicle
mode are, it's still a much more solid alt mode than on the other releases
of his Beast Hunters design.

        Ultra Magnus sees the massive Predacon
coming from a mile away. He doesn't know who the big dragon is, and he
doesn't care. All he knows is that the dragons are dangerous, and must
be defeated. He converts to robot mode and leaps into the air, bringing
the Forge of Solus around in a shattering blow that would destroy a lesser
robot. Grimwing takes the blow, and is only momentarily fazed. The battle
is short, violent, and never in doubt. It ends with Ultra Magnus on the
ground, disarmed and barely functional. Grimwing stands over him. "Pathetic,"
he says. "I hoped to learn something from you, but this new race of Cybertronians
must all be liars and savages." He leans down to look into the optics of
his Autobot opponent, "Be warned. This world is in grave danger from my
fellow Predacons. I will restrain them. You and your fellows stay out of
my way or be destroyed." And then he is gone, leaving Ultra Magnus dented
and smoking in the dust.
