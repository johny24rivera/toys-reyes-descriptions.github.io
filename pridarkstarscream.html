    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original Prime First
Edition Starscream. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of

     Most of the Bigbadtoystore.com
exclusive "Dark Energon" redecos are an homage to something, and Starscream's
homage is the most obvious; given his primarily black-and-purple color
scheme, he's clearly an homage to
     <a href="g1skywarp.html">
      Skywarp
     </a>
     .
Most of his "black" plastic isn't solid black, though it may look it from
a casual glance. In keeping with "Dark Energon"-themed redecos, his black
plastic is transparent, though unless you've got a strong light behind
him it's dark enough where it looks like a normal black regardless. I would've
preferred a more "solid" black, but it still looks pretty good. The shades
of violet chosen for this redeco are very nice-looking, too, contrasting
with the black excellently and are well spread-out throughout the figure
to keep any parts from looking "all black". Some of the violet plastic
is glittery, giving it a semi-metallic shade (most obvious on his robot
legs), while some of the smaller "connector pieces" are actually a different,
more paler shade of violet that's not quite different enough to serve as
a complimentary color-- at a glance, they look like shades of the same
color. There's also a couple of accent colors, such as the silver on his
face and hips, a really nice-looking metallic bronze cockpit, and dark
blue where his "rubbery bits" are, such as on his nosecone and knee-spikes.
The blue in particular is a really eye-catching shade, complementing the
black nicely while contrasting against the other colors exceedingly well.
A few violet paint apps on Starcream's wings and cool "slashed Dark Energon
Decepticon" logos on the wings round out his paint apps. In actuality,
he doesn't have a whole lot of paint apps for an exclusive figure, but
his colors are so varied he honestly doesn't really need any more.

     Dark Energon Starscream
is a fantastic redeco-- not just because he's homaging Skywarp's awesome
color scheme, but because he's going a bit beyond it, with some really
nice dark blue plastic in there as well as some bronze cockcpit detailing
and a good mix of his colors in both modes, keeping him from looking too
"one-tone" in either mode. Recommended-- this is my favorite release of
this mold, and it's easy to repurpose into Prime Skywarp if you don't like
buying same-character redecos.
