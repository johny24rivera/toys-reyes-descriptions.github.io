    Just like his
    <a href="g1rodimus.html">
     G1
toy
    </a>
    , Rodimus Prime's vehicle mode is a futuristic "speedy winnebago"-type
vehicle. It's a bit more bulky and less aerodynamic than the G1 toy, but
it still looks great all around-- heck, he certainly has more mold detailing,
that's for sure. The flame paint applications on the front and on the sides
of the rear portion look great, but making them consist of more than just
a dull yellow-- perhaps an orange/yellow fade pattern-- would've made them
look even better. He still retains the typical Rodimus red, black, and
orange color scheme, and it still looks good even though it's been used
several times by now. He's also the first Titanium to have a see-through
cockpit, which is pretty cool. The orange "speed fins" behind the cockpit
on the original G1 toy have been moved on this version of the character--
they're not much smaller, and placed together in a verticle position between
the smokestacks. They don't look all that bad, but I preferred the old
placement of them better. There are also a few slight oddities with the
vehicle mode, even though overall it still looks pretty good-- for one,
the front wheels are too far back when compared to the front of the car--
it looks pretty odd. Secondly, though they're certainly not major extras,
the tops of the robot fits are a bit noticeable next to the smokestacks,
as are the robot feet on the back end of this mode.

    Rodimus Prime's robot
mode is outstanding, and one of the best 6" Titanium robot modes so far.
For one, it's awesome that the designer worked the trailer portion of the
vehicle mode into the transformation instead of having it split apart to
form a lame "base" like on the G1 toy. What's even more amazing is that
Rodimus still looks so much like the character, with no real changes in
his features, other than proportional improvements. Really, Rodimus' proportions
are great, and spot-on. The only problem I have is that his shoulder fins
are too small and too far back behind his chest. Plus, if you look at him
from the side, there's a noticeable gap in his torso. But those are the
only real downsides to this mode-- besides the aforementioned proportions,
he's got a great headsculpt-- it looks very Leader-ish while still retaining
Rodimus' trademark youth. He's also got fantastic articulation, the best
of the line up to this point--he can move at any major point on the body,
even at the waist, and he has more than one point of articulation at every
major point except the head and waist. And none of the joints are too tight
or too lose or anything. I also like how his little blaster was worked
into his transformation, that shows extra care went into the enginerring
of this Titanium. Rodimus' diecast parts are his chest, lower arms, and
lower legs.

    Titanium Rodimus Prime
is an outstanding upgrade to a pretty bad G1 toy who deserved better. He's
got a good vehicle mode and an outstanding robot mode, with great proportions
out the wazoo. One of my most highly recommended 6" Titaniums.

      Autobot prophecy spoke of a Chosen One
who would claim the Matrix and rise to defend Cybertron in its darkest
hour. No one ever suspected it would be Hot Rod. While no one doubted his
courage, his recklessness occasionally put other Autobots in danger. Few
Autobots were as fast, however, or as smart, and even fewer could have
been expected to survive the twisting, diabolical pathways within the body
of Unicron, or a confrontation with the mighty Galvatron.

      Survive he did, however, and became
Rodimus Prime. Yet even after the destruction of Unicron and the defeat
of Galvatron he was plagued by self-doubt. The power of the Matrix was
his to command, and the wisdom of past Autobot leaders lived within him,
but he lived always within the shadow of his mentor and idol Optimus Prime.
Leadership weighed heavy on on his shoulders, and though he never faltered,
he dreamed often of a simpler life.
