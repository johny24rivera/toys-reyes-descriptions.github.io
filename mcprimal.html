    Beast mode is a technorganic
gorilla. This mode is very crummy loking, and not very convincing at all.
For one, his head doesn't look like a gorilla's, it looks like an old bald
man's with his face contorted in disgust (probably from looking at this
toy). There also isn't any sort of connecting "hunchback" behind the head
to give this mode more of a gorilla appearance, either. The arms are also
just large rounded nubs, with no knuckles or whatever carved into them
at all. A very poor mode, indeed.

    Optimus Primal's transformation
to robot mode is very simple- TOO simple, in fact. Basically, you just
turn his arms around a quarter circle, and then do a quick head flip. Really
sad, actually. It just basically makes this toy look like its two "modes"
are the same guy with different faces. And they could not have picked a
worse color combo for Optimus Primal's face, as well. (Well, okay, they
COULD have, but you know what I mean.) At least his arms look better in
this mode, since they now have actual hands carved into the sides of them.
The legs are also rather accurate in this mode, too. Optimus Primal's allegiance
symbol can be found on a transparent red piece in the middle of his chest.

    A rather poorly designed
mode, and with a rather bad color combo, at that. As said before, the modes
barely look different from one another at all. I don't even know if I would
recommend this toy to completists....
