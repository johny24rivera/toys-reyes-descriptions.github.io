    Soundwave's new vehicle
mode is a reconnnaissance drone-- an incredibly apt alt mode, to the point
where I'm surprised he hasn't had this alt mode already on one of his many
incarnations over the years. Overall, the proportions of this mode are
fantastic, and the toy achieves what few aerial Transformers toys do--
namely, wings that are completely proportional to the size of the aircraft.
The broad, almost two-dimensional wings fit in well with Soundwave's sleek
body; about the only quibble I have with this mode in terms of the "plane
bits" are the lack of rear landing gear (he does have one small fold-out
wheel under the nose, though). Soundwave's color scheme is as-- per usual--
mostly blue, but it's a bit duller, paler shade of blue than he usually
gets, and combined with the black, doesn't look out-of-place on an aerial
drone at all. To give this mode at least a bit more contrast/visual interest,
there's a couple of really nice-looking light purple paint apps on his
nose and wings (though he does have considerably more of these "energon
lines" on his show model). There are a few robot mode extras in this mode,
though for the most part they're minor; Soundwave's feet stick out rather
obviously from below his nosecone and a small part of his lower arms stick
out EVER so slightly from under the wings, but the whole robot chest/Laserbeak
assembly on the back end is the biggest offender here, leaving Soundwave
with enough bulk on the bottom that a landing gear back here actually wouldn't
work if you wanted to keep him level.

    Soundwave's transformation
is pretty straightforward-- you basically turn him around, unfold his nosecone
to form his legs, move up and unfold his wings to become his arms, and
then swing out his head. It leaves Soundwave with a very unique robot mode,
however-- certainly the most unique he's gotten yet. He's VERY lithe and
stick-like, to the point of looking fragile (even though any parts that
are reakky skinny are made of bendy plastic, so no worries there). His
arms are very much two-dimensional, which I have mixed feelings about.
On the one hand, it fits in with his "lithe, creepy" vibe, but on the other
hand just a BIT more bulk on the lower arms-- to the point where we could
see an actual "arm line" there instead of just a couple of claws on the
end-- would have been preferable, from my perspective. There's also some
pretty blatant kibble behind his lower legs, made up of the front part
of his vehicle nosecone-- a bit of an eyesore, though at least it stays
out of the way of movement. He's also got a couple of wings behind his
back, but those fit in well with his general silouhette and don't "hang
off" in any manner whatsoever. His headsculpt is downright awesome and
creepy, having an exaggerated, pointier version of the Decepticon symbol
on his forehead crests while his face is a blank, emotionless visor, fitting
over the front of his chest to give him a slightly hunchbacked look. The
mold detailing on Soundwave in general is fairly minimalistic, a result
mostly of how skinny he is-- putting a bunch of detail on him would've
made him look too busy. There are a couple of hinges and decorative patterns
here and there, though, and his style of alternating between curved and
pointed areas helps him fit in with the other toys in the line. His color
scheme gets a bit more of a boost here, being broken up by black more often
but also adding a bit of silver on his forehead and a few more light purple
bits on his lower legs and waist. Again, I wish a bit MORE light purple
had been used, but he still looks pretty good, especially with the addition
of a nice dark purplish blue on some parts such as his inner arms and parts
of his chest, which complements the blue plastic very nicely and is just
a great-looking color. For articulation, Soundwave can move at the neck
(at two points), shoulders (at two points), elbows (at three points), waist,
hips (at two points), knees (at two points, due to his "chicken-walker"
stance), and at one point each on his toes and heels. This means you can
get some really creepy/awesome poses out of him, with hand and sideways
knee movement being the only real points missing here. (That said, his
skinny feet do restrict the number of poses you can balance him in slightly.)

    Soundwave's chest assembly
can detach and flip around a bit to become "Laserbeak", who is definitely
an alien-looking pet. Unlike previous Laserbeaks-- who were most definitely
birds of some sort-- this Laserbeak has no discernable head and is just
four wings attached together, more of a emotionless drone than a real extra
Transformer character-- which, actually, fits this Soundwave just fine.
Laserbeak can move up and down on both of his larger wings, and can also
move these two wings back-and-forth some, the latter being required for
his transformation. He has a peg on his bottom side so he can "perch" comfortably
on Soundwave's skeletal hand.

    Prime Soundwave w/ Laserbeak
is one very unique take on the character, and one that I love. His sculpt
bursts with (a lack of?) personality, being both creepy and skeletal while
also looking emotionless and cold with his complete lack of any real face.
He's got a few minor kibble problems in both modes, but other than that
this is a great toy of an interesting character in the Prime show, and
his partner Laserbeak is a cool extra. Highly recommended.
