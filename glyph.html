    Vehicle mode is a kiddie-fied
Volkswagen Beetle. This mode would have pretty good, if it weren't for
two major things. First, the proportions are WAY off, entirely too "kiddy"
for their own good. The car's almost as wide as it is long! Second, there's
absolutely no paint detailing in this mode whatsoever. The stickers of
a "spare tire" on the back and an Autobot insignia on top help some, but
not much. On a lesser note, the rubber tires stick on a surface if you
leave Glyph there for too long, although they do provide good traction.
The color scheme is pretty nice, though...

    Glyph's robot mode definitely
reveals the age of the toy, as it's a bit oddly proportioned, and the articulation
is very limited- only the arms at the shoulders can move functionally.
The legs can technically move up and down, and the feet can swing down
or up, but it doesn't look good unless it's in its default position as
pictured above. Glyph's arms also look rather odd because of the large
wheels hanging off of them. The head is also molded onto the front of a
silver square piece of plastic, so it doesn't have any discernable neck,
which is another downside. The head at least has some paint detailing,
though, which is more than I can say for the rest of the toy... Another
beef many people have with this mode is that it doesn't look feminine,
as Glyph is a female Transformer. I personally like it- after all, Transformers
are robots- technically speaking, they have no need for a feminine figure.
Glyph is also a bit back-heavy in this mode, although not so much as her
fellow exclusive

    , who almost always falls
over in his robot mode.

    Glyph might have been
a good toy back in 1984, but in this day and age, it doesn't cut the mustard.
The paint detailing is almost nothing, the articulation is very limited,
and the proportions are odd. Not to mention that she has a very similar
design to her partner exclusive Tap-Out, so she's essentially the same
toy in regards to playability. Her color scheme helps out a little, but
it's not enough to carry the toy by itself. Unless you really like exclusives,
I'd skip this one.

      One of the final survivors of a doomed
Autobot exploration mission, Glyph has spent several hundred years stranded
on a world that has become, for her, not unlike an immense science experiment.
A natural researcher and forensic scientist, Glyph's advanced hermeneutic
circuitry allows her to analyze and decipher even the most cryptic of patterns
and language structures. Exceptionally bright and intellectual, Glyph maintains
a nearly manic attentiveness to detail. Fascinated by the sheer complexity
of alien cultures and their histories, Glyph's eye for even the most obscure
of minutiae has become unmatched among her colleagues. While highly skilled
and intelligent, Glyph's robot form is neither particularly strong nor
durable.
