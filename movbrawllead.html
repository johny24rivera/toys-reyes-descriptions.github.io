    Brawl's tank form is
freaking huge-- and this is certainly appreciated for a $40 toy. It's been
a long time since we've really gotten a BIG tank Transformer, and this
toy certainly fits that bill. The proportions are pretty much perfect,
though there are two robot extras that are admittedly eyesores in this
mode-- the robot feet are VERY obviously hanging off the back of this mode,
and there's also a pretty obvious hole right in front of the turret where
Brawl's robot head pops up through during transformation. The detailing
on the toy is pretty good, with bolts, panels, rivets, and the like molded
in anywhere they'd be needed-- the tread detailing is especially well-done,
even if the treads aren't "real" because of the transformation (there's
just small wheels on the bottom of the treads to move Brawl along). The
color scheme is fairly good, with the different shades of green certainly
being appropriate for a military-type vehicle, though there are some oddities.
For one, on a few small section of this mode, like a few plastic parts
on the left side of the turrets and on the front middle area, a slightly
different shade of green is used than is used on the rest of the vehicle
mode. It's not a huge difference, to be sure, but the choice is rather
odd. Also, making the side missile packs clear plastic, even if it's for
the sound gimmicks, doesn't look all that great. I'd also liked to have
seen a few more of Brawl's bits of mold detailing brought out by the paint
detailing, which, though adequate, is mostly limited to just the dark greenish-blue
camo paint apps in this mode. As far as Brawl's gimmicks go, they're pretty
darned cool-- first, if you push in on the main turret, a red light comes
on at the end of the turret briefly as a "cannon firing" sound is emitted
from the toy. If you turn the smaller upper turret around about 45 degrees,
a longer "rat-a-tat-tat" sound is emitted from the toys, and the side-mounted
missile packs light up green. Also pretty cool, but considering you HAVE
to activate this gimmick during the transformation, it can get a little
annoying.

    Brawl's automorph feature
during transformation, like the other Movie Leader-class figures, involves
pushing up on a lever on his chest (in this case a large gray tab in the
middle of it) and then his head pops up and a few pieces on his chest slide
into place, along with several firing sounds emitted from the toy as it
does so as its green and red lights mentioned earlier light up. Unfortunately,
it can be triggered pretty easily in tank mode, which is rather annoying
given that otherwise solid-feeling alternate mode and the long string of
sound effects that are emitted. Brawl's other automorph features in this
mode involve his arm-mounted weapons, and are just really cool all-around
and well-designed. On his right arm, pushing a black slider on the top
of his gun extends the barrels in a really cool fashion, and lets a small
sight scope slide out from the side of it as well. On the left arm, if
you fold up the rotary machine gun on the back of said arm and then slide
it backwards, Brawl's scythe-like blades rotate forwards to give him even
more slashing action, if his actual hand-claws aren't enough. Yup, Brawl
is certainly PACKED with weaponry in this mode, and it really adds a lot
to the toy. As if the arm-mounted weapons weren't enough, the side-mounted
missile packs are rotated behind his shoulders in this mode, his smaller
tank guns are up behind his back (so it's not so hard to see him bending
forward to deliver another payload of weapons into his enemies that way),
and the main tank blaster swings to the right side of his body in this
mode, allowing him to use that gun as well. Unfortunately, the dual guns
on his upper back do come off a little easily (though they can easily be
snapped back on), and though I personally haven't had any problems with
his main turret-gun on his right side, I do worry about it, being a long
skinny piece of plastic that's not attached by a whole lot to the big,
bulky body. Brawl's mold detailing is just awesome in this mode, particularly
on his robot parts, little plates of armor, circuitry, hinges, and other
"robotic parts" are visible all over the place. His head is especially
well-molded, though I wish the paint on his mask-mouht had done different,
as the way it's painted currently it makes him look like he has a frowning
fish-face if you don't look at it the right way. The gold and off-white
paint apps on his robot parts really help add to the color scheme, as well,
and provide great contrast against the green and black. I especially love
Brawl's individually-articulated hand-claws, which can move at the base
of each finger and thumb-- and the thumb is even attached to another hinge
on the wrist to make it look more "mechanical" when it moves back and forth.
Besides movement there, Brawl also has movement at the elbows (at two points),
the shoulders (at three points), the head, the hips (at two points), and
the knees (at two points). His knee movement is restricted quite a bit
by his overly bulky legs, though, which is my main problem with this mode--
the entirety of the sides of his tank mode are stashed behind his lower
legs, and although this doesn't look bad from a front view, from a side
view it just makes his legs look ludicrously wide. Personally, I prefered
the simpler way the sides of the tank just hung off the sides of the lower
legs like on

    , as that
look better to me. This also makes his arms look really puny in comparison,
even though in actuality they're only a little small proportionally.

    Leader class Brawl is
a great toy in both modes, with tons of weapons, though he does have a
bit of a problem with kibble on his lower legs in robot mode, and some
of his robot parts are easily visible in vehicle mode. Still, he's got
great playability, awesome gimmicks and weapons, and looks really imposing--
recommended, especially over deluxe class Brawl.

      Decepticon Brawl is proud to be a big,
mean destruction-dealing machine. He's a one-robot wrecking crew, a mobile
mass of mayhem, and a serious problem for Autobots and humans alike. His
armored skin is thick enough to shrug off almost anything short of a point-blank
blast from a fusion cannon, and his built-in weapon systems are more than
adequate to bring down even the toughest enemy. He lives for the thudding
roar of his shells bursting among a cluster of enemies and the shrill crackle
of his lasers cutting through the armor of an Autobot warrior. He is a
fighter through and through, bored and moody during his standby cycles,
but happy as can be as soon as he rolls into battle.
