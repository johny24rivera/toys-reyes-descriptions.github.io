    Arcee finally gets a
futuristic car for an alt mode, just like her G1 version! Like many of
the Animated "Cybertronian" modes, this sportscar has some definite aspects
that seperate it from more traditional cars-- like the large rear wing-spoilers--
but it's not just a lazy alt mode with a robot mode done up in a yoga position.
The only real robot mode extras are the hands sticking out the back end--
otherwise, this mode is quite solid. As is traditional with Animated toys,
there's not much mold detailing due to the sleek alternate mode, but the
paint detailing on the front helps to keep Arcee from looking too plain
and boring. TheÂ  white-silver-reddish-pink design on the car's hood
is stellar, and helps to break up the reddish pink that makes up the bulk
of this mode. The white plastic itself looks nice, but it needed a bit
more contrast than that. (And indeed, the back end could use a bit more
paint detailing to break it up some.) I'm very glad they went with a more
reddish pink as opposed to a normal light pink for the main color, though--
that would've been a bit TOO girly for a boys' toy line, methinks. Her
wheels are partially hidden under the curves of the car mode, which gives
her aesthetic a bit more of a unique look-- like she's almost a hover vehicle,
but not quite. The cockpit is a nice transparent blue with a seat molded
on the inside, and the ends of her transparent blue swords sticking out
the back end look like trails of energy-exhaust-- again, a nice touch.
Too bad the headlights are merely little bits of yellow paint, though--
a bit of transparent plastic really would've suited her there. The middle
part of the car mode is also a tad questionable, with the parts not quite
lining up with the surrounding pieces very well, particularly on the sides--
she looks better from a top-down view compared to a side-view.

    Arcee's robot mode is
also fairly impressive for the most part. Her proportions are very close
to how she appears onscreen, with her limbs being fairly skinny. The downside
to this, though, is that her "car backpack" is fairly large, though not
a WHOLE lot moreso than the backpack she had in the cartoon show. (It's
honestly rather impressive, given that Arcee's initial robot mode design
for the show was a cameo and didn't really have an alt mode design in mind,
to my understanding.) Still, the backpack isn't so large to interfere with
her stability much, if at all. Her rear wing-spoilers from car mode can
be removed from the top of the car-backpack to make her look more show-accurate
and reduce back-kibble, which is a nice option. I honestly think they don't
look so bad, so I tend to keep them on, as it's not like the wings have
any other use or store anywhere else. Arcee has some really nice design
touches
that I like in this mode-- ones that arne't necessarily needed, but that
make the figure all the better for them. One is that the "waist holsters"
that are on so many Animated designs are actually seperate, movable pieces
on her waist, which is pretty darned cool. Little pieces of her car mode
also flip into her lower legs to make those parts of her look more solid--
it really wasn't needed at all, but it really adds to how her legs look.
Her ankles are on ball joints, allowing her to keep herself more stable
than she otherwise would have been. Also, her headsculpt is very well-done,
with nice light-piping-- the only thing I don't like about it is that her
lips aren't painted red, they're the same pink as the rest of her face,
which looks weird. I also like how her car windshield forms a bit of a
"skirt" in her robot mode-- an ingenious use of that piece of her vehicle
mode, there. As far as her gimmick, swords can be pulled out from her car-backpack
and placed in her hands. They look pretty cool, but be warned-- many people
have seen stress marks on Arcee's slender thumbs after putting the swords
in her palms. (It also takes a bit of a "push" to get them back in her
back-holsters.) Arcee's articulation is quite good-- she can move at the
neck, shoulders, elbows, waist (well, middle of the stomach, to be precise),
hips (at three points), knees, and ankles. However, her arms and neck are
on ball joints, so she actually has even more movement than this description
would make it seem.

    Animated Arcee is quite
a fine toy, and it's nice to see her finally get the sportscar alt mode
she had in G1. Her transformation is simplistic while still accomplishing
a lot, she's got pretty good proportions in both modes, and she isn't PINK
pink. Her backpack is a bit too big in robot mode, and there's a few other
niggling things, but overall I'd highly recommend her.

      Arcee has dedicated her life to the
power of information. As a teacher, she saw to it that young Autobots all
learned the value of the facts, and how to tell truth from lies. During
the war, she turned her dedication to the truth to carrying data for the
Autobot High Command, often from deep behind enemy lines. She will face
any danger to defend what is right, no matter what the cost.
