    Beast mode is a pillbug.
Looks very nice; no extras(except for on the bottom, but usually there
are). It can roll up into a ball, and looks nice, but cant roll very well
because of his pincers and tail slasher. This "rolling action" also hinders
any body movement except for this, though. The tail slasher and pincers
are both activated by pushing them back into the body, locking them in
place, and then pressing a button to release them. The antennae are individually
articulated, which is a nice touch. The detailing in this mode is also
very good as well.

    Robot mode is very disappointing.
Almost his entire body is an extra; his entire pillbug body is sticking
out of his back. His hands also cant move much; they stay in one of two
positions, due to the rolling action; stuck to his sides, or clamped to
his chest like he's hiding something. His legs are skinny and dont hold
him up well, but his face looks cool, like a gas mask with horns.

    A nice looking toy in
beast mode, but not very good in his robot mode.

      Burrowing deep into desert sand dunes,
Retrax survives in a series of cool, cavernous tunnels lined with the remains
of fallen enemies. His greatest defense is his ability to curl into a ball
and escape danger by racing across the desert like a turbocharged tire
screaming down a mountain. Or, when attacking, he can roll over a similar-sized
enemy and crush their body upon impact, then use his powerful front pinchers
to dissect them in seconds.
