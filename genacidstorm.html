       Venin is a bit of an
enigma as far as repaints go. As you may have been able to tell from the
name, he was originally going to be homaging the Insecticon G1 Venom--
but instead Hasbro changed his colors when it was determined his pack-in
buddy was going to be Acid Storm. The colors themselves aren't very obviously
homaging anything, though a common guess is that it's an homage to the
G1 Pretender Bugly (though again, this is just a guess). Regardless, Venin's
color scheme of purple and black is very Decepticon-y, and these two colors
pretty much always go well with each other; Venin is no exception. The
silver wings also serve as a nice lighter contrast color, and the green
eyes in both modes help to add just that extra touch of paint to give him
a nifty accent color that goes great with both the purple and black (and
helps to tie his color scheme in a bit more with Acid Storm's, to boot).
I do wish he had another paint app or two for the larger areas of his purple
and/or black plastic to break things up a little more, but by and large
his colors are pretty ace, albeit not particularly fitting for a bee/wasp.

          Acid Storm follows his
general "usual" color scheme rule of being primarily green and black, but
the shades of those particular colors-- and their accents-- are a bit different
on this Legends version. The light green is rather lime-like in its shading,
but not BRIGHT like, say on his
          <a href="mpacidstorm.html">
           Masterpiece
toy
          </a>
          . I rather like this shade, and hope it's used more often on inevitable
future Acid Storm toys. There's also a fair amount of black on the toy
in its usual places-- the nosecone, the tailwings, the guns, the robot
head-- but there's also a bit of silver on this Acid Storm that isn't on
most other versions of the character, with the silver taking up the same
space here that it usually does on Thundercracker and Skywarp-- i.e., mainly
the intakes on the sides of the cockpit and the robot chest and waist.
I like upping the color variety here, so I have no issues with the silver.
The paint used for the cockpit is an orangeish shade, compared to the usual
yellow that is used there on Seeker redecoes-- here I feel it's a negative
change, as yellow would contrast quite well with the green and would help
him fit in with his fellow Seekers better. Definitely the most interesting
change from Acid Storm's usual deco job, however, are the purple-and-white
stripes on his wings. Not only are they in the same style as on most other
Seekers to help him blend in on a shelf a bit better, but they also pop
VERY well against the green, to the point where I wish they were used a
bit more on the toy, perhaps a bit on his robot mode appendages. This is
another departure from the norm on this redeco that I hope is used on future
Acid Storm toys.

            The Acid Storm &amp;
Venin set both have great paint deco jobs. The addition of purple and silver
to Acid Storm's normal overall already-good color scheme does wonders,
and Venin's black-and-purple color scheme looks awesome on almost any toy.
That said, neither are particularly impressive molds, and thus I'd only
recommend this set to Seeker completists.

              Some warriors prefer an all-out frontal
assault. Acid Storm and Venin take a more treacherous approach. Acid Storm
can seed the atmosphere with toxins to create metal-melting acid rain.
Venin uses his stinger to poison any life form and rot them from within.
It might not be as flashy as triggering an explosion, but for the evil
purposes of the Decepticons, it's just as destructive.
