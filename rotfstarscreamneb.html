    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to the original RotF Voyager
Starscream toy. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of the
original RotF Voyager Starscream toy

     In Cybertronian, "nebular"
apparently means "mint chocolate chip". 'Cause man, this Starscream redeco
sure seems like he'd taste like a York patty. Starscream's core color of
tan has been darkened considerable to a chocolate-y brown, but the main
thing that catches the eye about this repaint are the cool metallic light
green tattoos. And, even though most of the tattoo paint apps are the same
as on the mainline release, there are a few extra added, like on the nosecone.
The tattoos really look striking against the otherwise fairly dull color
scheme, and really make Starscream stand out on a movie toy shelf. Starscream's
more minor colors-- like the black, transparent amber, and silver paint
apps-- have been unchanged for this release, but given the base brown color
they go just about as good with this color scheme as they did with the
original.

     Nebular Starscream is
a nice change from his usual fairly bland tan/black color scheme, and the
already eye-catching tattoo paint apps are made moreso by the conversion
of them to a nice metallic green color. It's certainly not for those who
prefer their toys realistically colored, but it's a nice "out there" redeco
that oddly works. Recommended slightly over the mainline release.

       On Cybertron tattoos are more than mere
decoration. They can be packed with super conductive materials and symbiotic
nano-machines to enhance a robot's sensors and strengthen his weapons.
Starscream designed his tattoos to help him locate the fragments of the
AllSpark, as well as extend his range and power in the air. When his new
sensor net detects any ancient artifact from Cybertron, they glow softly,
charging his weapons and boosting his engine output.
