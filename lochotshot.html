     Hot Shot's vehicle mode
is pretty accurate to his larger counterpart, so no complaints with this
mode. Plenty of mold detailing, and there's even the little flip-out Key-activated
"accele-wings" from the larger version (though of course, they aren't Key-activated
on this toy; you have to flip out the wings yourself). The gold paint detailing
used on the windows and headlights looks good, but those are his ONLY paint
apps visible in this mode, so Hot Shot still needs a few more apps, like
on his rear section or something, to break up all the blue.

     Hot Shot's robot mode,
however, got rather stiffed by being converted into a smaller toy. For
one, the car roof "backpack" swivels around on its central point far too
easily, to the point where it's hard to get it to stay in one place when
you're playing with Hot Shot. The arms look even odder than they do on
the origianl version, with a large skinny bit between the hands and the
shoulders. Hot Shot's articulation is also pretty limited-- he can only
move at the shoulders, slightly inwards below the shoulders, and at the
hips. And the shoulders themselves pivot around only if you move the roof
backpack out of the way a little, plus the knees tend to collapse into
the lower legs a bit easily, as the tabs that keep them in place aren't
that strong. This, coupled with his lack of fold-out feet like on the larger
version (thus rendering him more unstable), severely limits his posability.
On the plus side, though, Hot Shot's robot head and chest have pretty good
sculpting, and some nice paint detailing. Still, that's not nearly enough
to save the mode.

     Legends of Cybertron
Hot Shot has a nice vehicle mode, but definitely the worst robot mode of
the Legends of Cybertron toys, with odd proportions, looseness in the back
and knees, and very low articulation. Considering the "normal" Hot Shot
toy is only $10 anyway, you're better off springing for that figure.
