    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Energon Megatron. For a
review on the mold itself, read the review of Energon Megatron

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     And here we come upon
the Megatron repaint called Galvatron, now pretty much a staple in every
Transformer series. However, if any new Transformer is deserving of the
name Galvatron, it's THIS one. The mold itself is pretty much G1 Galvatron
as a jet anyways. In fact, this is the color scheme this mold should have
had in the first place. It's practically G1 Galvatron's to a T-- the purple,
silver, and orange go together absolutely MAGNIFICENTLY. And this time
around, Hasbro has added several a few other colors to liven up the mix
even more-- the metallic cherry red used for Galvatron's chest, knees,
and eyes is really striking, and looks positively beautiful. (They need
to make a Transformer just coated in this stuff one day...) The white covering
the various Decepticon symbols also helps to differentiate them from the
surrounding purple plastic, and also looks good, too. And the metallic
teal and bronze, used on the rear of the plane mode and a bit on Galvatron's
robot chest, also helps give Galvatron a bit of a "royal, kingly" appearance--
certainly appropriate for a Decepticon leader. About the only complaint
I have with the color scheme is that the tank-gun that comes with Galvatron
only has a few paint apps, and though the purple and gray do look nicely
together, there's a lot of mold details on the tank-- I would have liked
to see them brought out more. But I can't complain too much, as Galvatron
himself has got oodles of paint on him.

     No mold changes have
been made to Energon Galvatron.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     Galvatron is an absolutely
terrific repaint of Megatron, and a great G1 nod at that. All the colors
go flawlessly together-- this is, in my opinion, the best Energon repaint
there is. However, as cool as it looks, I still have trouble putting it
into the "must-buy" category of 9.0 or above, because of the fact that
the mold is still way too simplistic for a $40 toy. But still, if you can
get over that, this is definitely a recommended toy.

       Having undergone an intense reformatting
at the hands of Unicron, Megatron has become Galvatron. Now, more ruthless
and power-hungry than ever before, Galvatron possesses the same insidious
qualities as Megatron and is ten times more powerful. After striking a
deal with Unicron, Galvatron was granted an upgraded weapons arsenal that
has made him practically invincible. Along with his advanced arsenal, Galvatron's
hunger for conquest has grown nearly insatiable. The universe itself does
not seem to be enough for this ruthless tyrant. He will even use the god-like
Unicron as a pawn in his game of eternal conquest.
