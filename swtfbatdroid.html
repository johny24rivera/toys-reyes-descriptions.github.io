    The Battle Droid's vehicle
mode is an AAT-- a drone transport of sorts, which is pretty fitting. Unlike
most SWTF, the Battle Droid doesn't have a boring off-white or gray color
scheme, but instead makes use of some pretty interesting designs made with
dark blue against light blue, with a bit of black for accent colors. It
really helps him to stand out amongst other SWTFs, and the design is pretty
awesome. There's also some nice "blackened" paint apps near the holes in
the very front of the vehicle, which adds a little to the realism factor.
The AAT's main turret can rotate around 360 degrees, though it can't aim
up or down, sadly. It fires a standard spring-loaded missile launcher when
you press the tan button on the top. His two small side guns can rotate
up and down, however. Generally the proportions of the mode are spot-on,
but there is one noticeable addition-- the droid's arms stick out VERY
blantantly from the back near the rear, and are obvious at practically
every angle except a front one. They're made even more obvious by the contrasting
colors-- however, on the plus side those extra wheels on the bottom of
those droid arms give the vehicle mode some extra stability.

    In mech mode, the Battle
Droid is pretty iffy, however. It honestly looks like one of the droids
decided to dress up as an AAT for Halloween-- it's very clear which parts
are the robot parts and which are the vehicle parts, pretty much only the
chest and waist really "shared" in between the two modes. And even then,
given the structure of his chest and his the rear turrets folds down behind
his main body, it makes him look a bit on the fat side. His skinny limbs
only exaggerate this, though it being a Battle Droid the skinny limbs are
understandable. The biggest offenders in this mode thouhg are unquestionably
the huge halves of the front part of hte vehicle mode just hanging off
his waist. They don't even remotely look like anything or complement the
mode, and get in the way of movement and balance. (Speaking of movement,
the Battle Droid can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points), elbows,
wrists (at two points), hips (at two points), knees (at three points),
and ankles (at two points). The hip, knee, and elbow movement is a bit
restricted given the aforementioned vehicle mode kibble, but generally
he's pretty posable for a SWTF figure. As far as his color additions, the
tan and green really contrast well with the blue, and give some visual
pop to a line that's generally lacking it-- but as I said before, it really
differentiates the mech mode and vehicle mode parts a bit TOO much from
each other. For weaponry, the Battle Droid can hold either the front part
of his main turret which detaches from vehicle mode, or the two small side
guns on the sides of his chest can also detach and be held by either hand.
It's not a very stable connection, though, so he tends to drop them fairly
easily.

    The SWTF Battle Droid
has one of the more interesting vehicle designs and color schemes of the
line, but his mech mode is pretty poor in most respects, with huge kibble
and weird proportions. A bit below-average as far as Star Wars Transformers
go.
