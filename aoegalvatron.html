    Galvatron's alternate
mode is a 2012 Argosy Freightliner truck cab, and from the FRONT at least,
this mode looks pretty good. The truck cab proportions are pretty much
perfect for the front half, with not even a hint of extras... until you
get to the back end. It's here where this mold sadly falls apart; beyond
the wheels and "vehicle shell bits" on the sides, the back end is VERY
clearly the robot legs on their sides. There's not even much of an attempt
to hide it; there's very obvious gaps in between the two legs (which only
meet at at the feet, and not even in a manner that clips said feet together),
and all the robot mode detailing of the upper and lower legs-- as well
as the robot hips and waist-- are blatantly obvious. Part of me wants to
blame whoever came up with the CGI design for this, given there really
aren't ANY parts shared visually between Galvatron's vehicle and robot
modes on the movie model, and Hasbro did their best with what they had...
but I would've dealt with a few extra chunks or panels on the robot legs
if it meant the back half of the vehicle mode looked better. This... this
is just awful. The color scheme is mostly that blah milky gray on the back
half, but thankfully the color scheme gets much more interesting on the
front half of this mode, where the gray is a milky, almost metallic-looking
shade of a darker bluish gray, which both contrasts and complements against
the light milky gray. There's also plenty of paint apps on the front half.
There's some nice movie-accurate decorative silver stripes on the sides
of the vehicle mode, as well as on the headlights and below the front windows,
while the windows themselves-- along with the grill and the rim above the
front windows-- are painted a nice, dark, glossy black. I wish the paint
didn't cover the little divider between the two front windows, but that's
a small quibble. Even though there's just a little of it, the bits of light
blue above the windows really pop against the black-- I really wish this
color was used more on the figure. The mold detailing itself on the truck
cab is rather smooth in most places, but detailed where it needs to be,
like on the more detailed stripes on the sides, the futuristic-looking
headlights and grill, and the wheels. Galvatron's weapon is a spring-loaded
missile launcher that's meant to be held in one of his hands in robot mode
to give him that "arm-converting-to-cannon" configuration that so many
movie TFs have, but in this mode it can only store on the top of the truck
roof-- a bit of an odd place, given that big gap in the back half that's
just begging to be covered up (not to mention color-wise it would blend
in better back there). Still, at least it gives Galvatron some firepower
in this mode, too.

    Galvatron's transformation
is very straightforward for a "Generations movie" toy-- just BARELY out
of the "easy" category-- with the legs splitting obviously in half while
the front half of the truck mode opens up to let you fold out the head
and arms before it collapses in on itself on Galvatron's robot back. Honestly,
given how the truck mode isn't visible on Galvatron's CGI model in robot
mode at all, the truck cab section collapses quite well behind Galvatron's
back-- yes, it's very obviously there, and it can get in the way of shoulder
and elbow articulation a little, but it stays in place very solidly and
doesn't protrude from his general silhouette TOO much-- it certainly looks
like it's a smaller part of his vehicle mode than it really is, and doesn't
make Galvatron overly backheavy. As for the main body, Galvatron's very
nearly perfect to his movie model here-- there's little bits of his wheels
on the backside of his lower legs, which are easily overlooked, and that's
it. His core proportions are pretty much spot-on, though the "grinder hole"
in his chest could stand to be a bit bigger, and his upper legs a tad longer.
The mold detailing in this mode is absolutely incredible-- Galvatron really
does look like a "modernized" version of movie Megatron, with a somewhat
similar head-crest design in some respects but much more aerodynamic and
rounded overall. There's tons of tube-like details all over the place,
from his neck to his chest to his gun, and there's plenty of little bits
'n bobs of detailing all over the rest of him too, like portions of a fake
truck grill on his lower legs and sweeping ridges that look like they COULD
have come from some part of his vehicle mode, but didn't. The main color
for this mode is sadly almost entirely that blah light milky gray-- I really
wish a fair amount of it had been painted silver, it really would've helped
him look considerably more modern and sleeker. That said, there's at least
a little bit of bronzish tan plastic on his shoulders, elbows, and knees,
though the metallic navy blue and pale bronze paint is used quite liberally
throughout this mode to highlight most of the major details (the tubing
on the chest and neck, in particular). No large portion of him is left
unpainted, gun aside. (He does have light piping for his eyes, but the
plastic is too dark; it absolutely does not work at all.) For articulation,
Galvatron can move at the neck, shoulders (at three points each, four if
you include the shoulder armor "flaps"), elbows (at two points), hips (at
three points), knees, and ankles (at two points, including ankle tilts).
I wish he had some knee or waist rotation, but other than that he's quite
poseable.

    AoE voyager Galvatron
is the best toy of him from the line in terms of articulation and general
proportions, with most of the positives coming from his stellar-looking
robot mode (proportions, detailing, surprisingly tucked-away kibble, and
all) and the front half of his truck mode. Unfortunately, the back half
of his truck mode is really, REALLY weak, and an eyesore on what is otherwise
an impressive yet simple transformation for a design that shares no apparent
elements between its truck and robot modes. Recommended, just don't spend
too much time looking at his truck mode from an angle other than the front.

      When Optimus Prime dealt a crushing
blow to Megatron in the Battle of Chicago, the triumph was short-lived.
The victorious Autobots were rewarded with exile and new enemies determined
to bring about their total destruction. If there was ever any doubt, the
Autobots now know for certain: as long as there is a Decepticon with a
spark in his circuits, their centuries-old war will continue.
