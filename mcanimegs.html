    Megatron's vehicle mode
is.... um... his robot mode laying down with propellers. Really, I'm not
exaggerating that much, LOOK at it. It's pathetic, even for a Happy Meal
toy. The cockpit covers up the head pretty well (though the windows could
really use some paint), but other than that there's not even an attempt
to reshape the robot mode into a vehicle mode. Really, I don't have much
else to say about this mode, it's just bad all over. Well, I guess the
propellers spin pretty well... but that's it.

    Megatron's robot mode
is certainly much better than his alt mode, and the proportions are pretty
good-- he's very "Animated" in his stance, and the mold detailing is done
pretty well, especially on the arms and head. Most of the necessary paint
details are filled in-- such as on the head, legs, and waist-- but a couple
of red paint apps on his shoulders relaly would've made him look a bit
more complete in this mode. So he LOOKS pretty good-- however, that's not
to say there aren't some major downsides to this mode as well. For one,
he can barely move at all-- he can turn his head and his shoulders can
move back and forth SLIGHTLY, but that's it. Also, the propellers that
unceremoniously hang off his arms don't have any locking mechanism, so
they just swing around even if you move him a little. Finally, the cockpit
piece just sticks out of his back almost horizontally. Even making a SLIGHTLY
better notch for it in the back would've helped it collapse into the back
of the chest pretty well, but nope-- it sticks out there for no real reason,
sadly.

    Happy Meal Megatron
has a decent, if brickish, robot mode that pulls off the "Animated" style
quite well, but MAN is his "vehicle mode" irredeemably bad. Just.... get
another version of him. ANY version.
