not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     A release of the Classics
deluxe Seeker mold as Thundercracker has finally happened (outside of
     <a href="bcthundercracker.html">
      Botcon
     </a>
     ,
that is), and it's pretty darn faithful to the character's G1 representation.
The blue used is a REALLY attractive shade, having a bit of a glittery,
semi-metallic look to it, and just a touch lighter than the shade of dark
blue used on the
     <a href="g1thundercracker.html">
      G1 toy
     </a>
     , while still
sustantially darker and less green-tinted than the Botcon 2007 version.
The blue goes quite well with all the silver (which is particularly visible
in robot mode), as well as the black. The white-and-red stripes on the
wings are taken pretty much directly from his G1 toy, and help give the
vehicle mode in particular a bit more of a color variety-- and they help
add a bit more contrast, as well. Outside of the dark blue color difference,
the main difference between this toy and the Botcon release is that this
version has a bit more red in robot mode-- namely, on the shoulders and
chest. Even with those little bits, it really helps to add a bit more color
variety and pop to the robot mode, and the color changing of the bulk of
the missile launchers to black (instead of the same blue as the missiles,
which they were on the Botcon release) helps in this respect as well.

     Generations deluxe Thundercracker
is definitely a welcome sight for those wishing to finally complete their
deluxe Classics Seekers without paying high exclusive prices for one. However,
instead of "settling" for a blander color scheme like-- in my opinion--
you have to if you buy the mass-release versions of
     <a href="gendirge.html">
      Dirge
     </a>
     and
     <a href="genthrust.html">
      Thrust
     </a>
     , here you get a superior deco to
the Botcon version, which just pops a fair amount more. This guy definitely
renders the Botcon 2007 release obsolete in pretty much every respect--
highly recommended.

       Back on Cybertron, Thundercracker was
a master of using sound to his advantage. His fear-inducing sonic booms
were tuned perfectly to the composition of the atmosphere. Sonic vibrations
from his attacks could be felt thousands of miles away, generating panic
in those nearby, and deep unease even on the other size of the planet.
