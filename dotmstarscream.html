    Starscream's mainline
toy has been "downsized" a bit for Dark of the Moon, but that doesn't mean
it's any less accurate in its F-22 Raptor alt mode. The proportions remain
extremely accurate, though like with most jet Transformers, there is a
bit of underbelly robot mode kibble. Here, it's his arms and part of his
waist underneath the rear two-thirds or so of the jet. They're folded up
against the underbelly in about as best a manner as one can think of without
them outright folding away, however, and particularly when you have Starscream's
Mechtech weapons equipped they aren't as big a deal as you'd think. The
panels underneath the main wings-- used in robot mode-- bug me more, honestly,
since they stick out from Starscream's silouhette a tiny bit more. Starscream's
color scheme of a tannish white, brown, and gray aren't exactly the most
eye-catching, but they go together pretty well and are-- for the most part--
accurate to how he appears in the movie (though his jet mode colors are
just a touch lighter than they should be). As with the previous movie,
Starscream is "tattooed out" in vehicle mode, with alien-esque designs
and "Cyberglyphs" all over his form, making him quite eye-catching. (That
said, the copper brown is a decent enough shade and gives him a dark color
besides gray to play against the white, even if it's not really movie-accurate.)
Starscream's Mechtech weapons are rather unique-- one is simply a blade
that can be turned around to serve as a gun in this mode, whereas the other
has a "real" Mechtech gimmick-- folding it out reveals a super-long sword,
whereas just like the other, it can be turned around to form a gun. Stick
them both together, however, and you get a weapon (mostly made for the
robot mode) that is an almost obscenely long, double-edged blade weapon--
and, importantly, it actually STAYS in that mode until you take the weapon
apart, unlike with most Mechtech weapons' alt configurations. Starscream
has a grand total of six Mechtech ports (though two are inaccessible in
this mode)-- one under each of his main wings, one under each of his rear
wings, and another two on the sides of his robot lower arms. Starscream
has three fold-out landing gear in this mode, but unfortunately none of
them have any actual working wheels.

    Starscream's transformation
is one of the most ingenious in the entire line, in my opinion, with lots
of panels flipping, compressing, and/or folding up upon themselves. That
said, it's still not too hard, though I would put it on the more difficult
end of "medium"-- it may take two or three times back and forth before
you really get the hang of it. The result is, incredibly, the most accurate
Movie Starscream robot mode outside of the much-larger Leader class version--
quite impressive for a deluxe toy. The sides of the stomach are a bit more
rectangular than they should be, and the arms a little skinnier, but other
than that Starscream looks remarkably like his movie model. All of his
wings fold behind his main body and completely out of the way, and I love
how two of the landing gear become his "heel spurs" to keep him steady
in this mode. Everything also pegs together well, so no stability issues
here. His mold detailing really shines in this mode, with little pistons
and other mechanical details all over his robot parts (and all the requisite
lines on his jet parts, as well). He has a few glyph markers on his shoulders
and hips to keep him from looking too plain on his appendages in this mode,
and the usage of copper on the upper chest and light metallic silvery blue
and dull red on the face helps give him a bit more color, at least. As
for articulation, Starscream's got that covered, too-- he can move at the
neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points), wrists (at two
points), hips, knees (at three points), and his toe pieces on each foot
can also move up and down a little bit. This means he can get into some
pretty darn dynamic poses.

    Hasbro has improved
upon their Movie Starscream toys with each subsequent movie line, and the
Dark of the Moon version-- despite being a deluxe this time around-- continues
that tradition. Outside of the pricey Leader class version, this is the
most accurate-- and one of the most impressive-- Starscream toys out there,
movieverse or otherwise. He still has a bit of jet mode kibble on the underbelly--
and I wish his stomach sides weren't so square in robot mode-- but everything
else on him is about as perfect as one could reasonably expect it to be,
including an awesome Mechtech weapon (or two, depending upon how you look
at it). Highly recommended.

      Though he is an incredibly skilled fighter,
the real secret to success for Starscream is: Never fight fair. He's always
sure to bring a bigger, more powerful weapon to battle than his opponent,
and he never takes on someone he's not sure he can handle.
