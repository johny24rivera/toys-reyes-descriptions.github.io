not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For
a review on the mold itself, read the review of Classics Starscream

     Nacelle is yet another
use of the Classics Starscream mold, which never seems to get enough uses
(and I'm not complaining-- I love this mold!). This time around it's another
obscure blink-and-miss-him Seeker whose coloration who was seen very briefly
in the original cartoon. The more specific paint apps for Nacelle are taken
from a Japanese catalog image for G1 Thrust (obviously G1 Thrust didn't
actually make it to the market in these colors). Nacelle sports a fairly
patriotic color scheme, with white, red, and blue being his main colors.
The blue and red are a bit different from the usual shade, however-- the
blue is actually a dark periwinkle, and is my personal favorite of Nacelle's
various colors. The red is a somewhat dark version of the color-- almost
a "brick red", if you will, though the paint is noticeably lighter in shade
than the plastic, which is slightly off-putting when they'e close together.
All of the colors contrast excellently with each other, though, and I particularly
like how the jet mode goes from blue to red-and-white to white at the back
end. The red line paint apps on the front of the wings, sides of the fins,
and the faded circular paint apps on the wings help make Nacelle stick
out a bit more among his various Seeker brethren, and was a nice choice.
Like pretty much all Seekers, Nacelle has some transparent light orange
used on his cockpit windows, and black on his nosecone and rear thrusters.
His face is mostly unpainted blue plastic, though, with a dull red face
and dull yellow eyes. I like how the blue head helps differentiate him
from most Seekers, but I've never been a fan of red faces, and Nacelle
is no exception. His intakes and parts of his chest are painted a VERY
glittery metallic silver which looks fantastic, and which has some minor
dull red and yellow details on them. There's also a few other dull red
and yelow details on some of his robot parts, like around the waist and
lower legs, and the white plastic looks good on his lower legs arms, with
red helping to break up the colors even more on his upper legs.

     Nacelle has the same
wings used on
     <a href="bcthrust.html">
      BotCon 2007's Thrust
     </a>
     , but he
retains Starscream's head. I like the differentiation from both Thrust
and Starscream here by swapping parts, but unfortunately he has two misassemblies.
His tailfins are swapped, which is kind of annoying but not a huge deal
given that they're flat anyways. The slightly bigger issue is that the
pieces that connect his wings to his main body-- and are used to flip his
wings around during transformation-- are also backwards, so there is no
curved "notch" to allow the wings to flip around. If you try to force them
to, they may actually pop off altogether. Thankfully, this has a pretty
simple fix-- just take an exacto knife or the like and pick off a little
notch of your own on the right side of the connector piece, and everything
will be fine.

     TFSS Nacelle is a nice
figure for an obscure Seeker who had yet to get a toy, and his color scheme
is pretty good and varied up nicely-- as far as colors go, I'd put him
slightly above-average for Classics Seeker squadron, with his rating getting
a notch down because of his misassemblies. One should keep these in mind,
and make sure in particular to fix the pieces that connect his main wings
to his body before you transform him. An easy recommendation for Seeker
fans; if you're sick of the Classics Starscream mold, though, he's not
amazing enough to change your mind.

       Nacelle is almost as much at home on
the battlefield as he was back in his old laboratory at Tesarus. He has
a keen mind for the sciences, having worked alongside Bitstream and Hotlink
under Starscream's Helex-Yuss Decepticon Research &amp; Advancement team.
Upon the Nemesis's departure to Earth, he was assigned as a lab assistant
to Shockwave. During that time, Nacelle engineered the modified wing designs
used for the second wave of Earth-bound Seekers, eventually adapting one
of the prototypes into his own chassis. Due to his longing to return to
his laboratory work, Nacelle can become absent-minded in the midst of battle.
Nacelle's overall effectiveness, however, outweighs any liability he may
cause. He can fly at speeds up to MACH 2.7 and his high-powered turbines
can double his speed for up to 1 minute.
