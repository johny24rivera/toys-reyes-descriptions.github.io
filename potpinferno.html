    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Combiner Wars Hot Spot.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Combiner Wars Hot Spot

     Hot Spot's been the redeco
for years now-- my my my, how the turntables! Yep, Inferno is now the redeco
of Hot Spot, in more "traditional" fire truck colors, being mostly red
and black, with some white primarily on his ladder. Even though those are
by far Inferno's most dominant colors, they're broken up pretty well, with
no overly large section of red or black in either mode. In robot mode,
this is mostly accomplished by black paint apps on the shoulders, chest,
and waist, while in vehicle mode, there's the white ladder that makes up
a major third color, and there's also some silver and yellow for his sirens
and some silver on the sides of his ladder and a bit of red paint up there,
as well. In robot mode, you can see more silver paint on the sides of his
lower legs, some silver and black on his wrists and hands, and some yellow
on his chest. He's also got some foil stickers. Some simple robotic button-like
details are on the top of the front section; there's some "F.D." fire department
symbols on the sides of the front section; there's some faux headlights
on his waist; an Autobot symbol near the top of his chest; and some smaller
Autobot symbols and red lines across the top of the combined mode chest.
I'm not a fan of foil stickers, but these are small enough and sparse enough
I don't particularly mind them.

     As far as mold changes
go, for one, Inferno comes with the "Prime armor" glorified feet bits that
you can plug into the side of his ladder and that, like basically every
piece of Prime Armor in the PotP line, stick out very blatantly. He comes
with a small "matrix core"-detailed piece that can fit into the front of
one of the Prime Armor pieces, which is sprayed with some light blue paint;
certainly appropriate for a Matrix-like detail. He also has a new head,
which is of course modeled quite well after G1 Inferno's head with some
more modernized details. He's got a "normal" silver face with light blue
eyes, and some side vents that are painted yellow, with a large "eyebrow"
ridge and a small bit above his forehead that's painted silver. It's a
solid headsculpt, although without the white "wings" on the sides, it looks
like it's missing a little something. The combined mode head is DEFINITELY
missing something, as it's just a straight recolor of the Defensor head
with a red forehead, a black chin and eyebrows, a silver face, and yellow
eyes. They never give a name for what the name of an Inferno-centered combiner
would be, either-- kind wish they had put a bit more effort into the combining
aspect of this redeco. He also has the same "water guns" that Hot Spot
has.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     PotP Inferno is a nice
redeco of Hot Spot, with a good mix of colors that are more typical of
what you'd find on a fire engine. The red, black, and white go together
quite nicely. He also has an excellent new headsculpt, but the lack of
change to the combined headsculpt makes this a toy I'd recommend more for
those who want a more "modernized" Inferno as opposed to one who combines--
the combiner aspect is just too shunted to the side for this toy, and the
toy itself is excellent even if you ignore that it combines.
