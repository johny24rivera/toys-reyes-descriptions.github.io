    Vehicle mode is a dump
truck. This mode, as is obvious from the picture above, is very "kiddy"
in its design. It's much wider than a dump truck really is, and the features
seem to be exaggerated almost to the point of being cartoony. (Yes, I KNOW
Transformers is a cartoon, but you know what I mean.) The front bumper
also looks pretty bad, consider that there's a pretty obvious gap between
the two front bumper plates. The robot hands are very visible in the middle
of the sides of the dump truck, and the robot feet are very visible from
the back of the truck as well. Not that good of a mode, overall, although
it's not TOO bad.

    Robot mode is pretty
good-looking, and much better than the vehicle mode. Heavy Load's rather
short for a deluxe, but he makes up for it in bulkiness. His lower legs
and upper arms are very big, and give him a "tough guy" appearance, which
definitely adds character. What adds character even more than this, however,
is Heavy Load's wonderfully detailed robot face. He has "sunglasses" for
optics, a large chin, and a smirk on his face that makes it look like he's
saying, "Hey, whassup?". A great touch! The sides of the head also hind
at Heavy Load's vehicle mode quite a bit, with a small "window" on one
side of the top of his head, and what looks like a mini-dump truck shovel
detailed on the back of his head. His head could not have been done better!
Heavy Load's also pretty articulated for such a bulky figure. His arms
can move in three places each, and his legs in four (two of those are in
his feet, which is rare in a Transformer). His feet are rather large and
floppy, however, and look a bit dorky. However, because of his large lower
legs and large feet, Heavy Load's very stable in this mode. Heavy Load
is lacking a bit in the paint detailing department in this mode; some more
detailing on the lower part of his body would have been appreciated. Heavy
Load's weapon is a large "claw" made out of the "shovel" part of his dump
truck mode. It's rather large and cumbersome for Heavy Load to use, however,
and the snapping spring on it is very weak- merely having Heavy Load hold
on to one part of it will cause the other part to droop a bit. Gladly,
he can store it on his back in this mode as well, which looks much better.

    A rather kiddy vehicle

      When Heavy Load bellows, "Lets haul,
Autobots!" he means HAUL! Hes the most powerful of the construction Autobots
and has an incredibly thick armor, making him a terrifying sight for any
Decepticon unlucky enough to get in his path. He is a martial arts master
and moves with graceful strength despite his bulky size.
