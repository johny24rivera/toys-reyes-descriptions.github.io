    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of LoC Starscream

     LoC Ramjet is a big ol'
nod to
     <a href="uniramjet.html">
      Universe Ramjet
     </a>
     , in both that he's
a repaint of a Seeker mold and in color scheme. LoC Ramjet mixes it up
a little, though, in that he has decidedly more black than his Universe
counterpart, and no gray. The gray looks really good against the white,
especially on the face-- the black face around the white helmet makes Ramjet
look really evil, almost like he has no face at all! I'm not fond of the
blue and the yellow-on-white, however, just like I wasn't fond of it on
Universe Ramjet-- it looks a little too loud and... un-Decepticonish. The
blue is of a slightly less obnoxious shade than it was on Universe Ramjet,
though, which is good.

     Given that he's a free
giveaway from Hasbro just for coming to the convention (although you can
buy him for anywhere from $10-25 online, depending on where you look and
how lucky you are), Ramjet features no mold changes, and with the exception
of a slight alteration to his chest app, his paint apps are a strict pallet-switch,
with no new paint apps when compared to LoC Starscream.

    <font face="OCR A Extended">
     LoC Ramjet is an okay
repaint-- the black parts look pretty nice, though I don't like how un-Decepticony
his color scheme is. LoC Starscream definitely looks better in the color
department, not to mention he's cheaper, too, so there's no real reason
to get Ramjet unless you're an LoC completist.
