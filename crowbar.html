    Crowbar's vehicle mode
is a bit different from how he actually appears in the movie-- he should
have the same vehicle mode as
    <a href="dotmcycrankcase.html">
     Crankcase
    </a>
    ,
but I suppose Hasbro didn't want three different police SUV characters,
which I suppose is a decent enough decision (why that didn't carry over
into the movie itself, I'm not sure). Crowbar's now a rather nondescript
black sportscar, though there's a bit of a "police" nod with one of his
rear view mirrors painted red and the other blue. Beyond a few silver apps
on the front grill and the light red taillights, though, there really isn't
any paint apps in this mode, which is really unfortunate-- the windows,
in particular, could use some paint just to spice things up a little. Black
windows on black plastic just makes it almost look like they're not windows
there at all. The proportions are great, though, and there's no robot extras
to speak of in this mode. The mold detailing is also pretty decent for
a sportscar mode, with the front hood and grill in particular having more
detailing than you'd expect. There are some definite odd "cracks" in the
vehicle mode due to how it separates for robot mode, however, which messes
up how the rear windows and rear sides look a little.

    Crowbar's transformation
is rather neat for a Legion class figure, with a lot of his parts spreading
out in robot mode so he looks considerably bigger-- a nice engineering
touch. He looks a bit lankier than he does in the movie, but in a cool
way, so I don't mind it much. The biggest downsides to this mode are definitely
the large shell halves of his car mode hanging off his arms, which get
a bit unsightly and odd near the hands in particular. His knees are also
a bit oddly jointed, with the knees molded a bit ABOVE where they actually
move, which can result in some odd poses if you don't have his legs in
a fairly "standard" position. The mold detailing on Crowbar's robot parts
is quite impressive in places, however, particularly on the chest, shoulders,
and head. His head doesn't actually have the dreadlocks due to the small
scale, but they are molded on his shoulders. Most of said robot parts are
also painted in a dull metallic bronze, giving at least a little color
to this mode beyond the head. That said, he's still rather dull when it
comes to his overall scheme-- but then again, that's movie accurate. As
for articulation, Crowbar can move at the shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles
(the former two on ball joints), so he's slightly above-accurate in that
department for a Legion toy.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Crowbar really needs
some more paint in vehicle mode-- and his car shells on his arms in robot
mode look a little odd-- but other than that he's a fairly solid and unique
Legion class toy, with a wonderfully lithe look in robot mode. Mildly recommended,
especially since this (sadly) is the only mold of the character made.
