    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Generations FoC Starscream.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Generations FoC Starscream

     If you didn't see this
redeco coming, well... you haven't been familiar with Transformers for
that long. Fall of Cybertron Thundercracker, as you'd expect, re-does the
FoC Starscream mold up in Thundercracker's traditional colors of blue,
black, and silver. The blue plastic used for this version of Thundercracker
is about mid-range as far as the various blues Thundercracker toys have
had over the years-- it's not light or a medium blue like on the lightest
'Cracker toys, but it's not very dark and metallic, either. Personally,
I like the latter the best, in most cases, and would've liked it more if
that had been the shade of blue used on this version of the character.
However, the blue is still sufficiently dark enough to contrast well against
all the silver paint on Thundercracker's chassis, while still being light
enough to distinguish itself from his black robot bits, so there's that.
What's quite nice is that the plastic that-- on most TFs-- tends to be
a blah light milky gray, here is a rather nice-looking, semi-metallic shade
of gunmetal gray. This means that it blends in almost seemlessly with the
silver paint, and just looks great. I REALLY wish they'd use this shade
of the color more often... As you'd expect, Thundercracker also has a transparent
yellow cockpit, and silver-and-red stripes on his wings. Another color
is added here that's not on most Thundercracker toys, and that's a bit
of light purple on some of the "vent" details of the figure, to give it
the "WfC/FoC" look with "Energon veins". It looks great, though I wish
it were used a bit more, particularly on the robot bits, since the robot
mode is noticeably less eye-catching than the vehicle mode because the
silver isn't nearly as prevalent (and the black more prevalent).

     No mold changes have
been made to FoC Thundercracker.

     If you're familiar with
the Seeker colorations, FoC Thundercracker isn't going to be a huge surprise--
you'll likely want him to complete the FoC Seeker trio, though I rank his
color scheme-- as usual-- as better than Starscream's, but not as good
as Skywarp's. However, I do like the slight aberrations from the norm on
the toy, such as the light purple paint apps and the nice-looking gunmetal
gray plastic-- it helps make "yet another Seeker repaint" more unique.

      <font face="OCR A Extended">
       Thundercracker believes that the ability
to fly is the ultimate expression of evolution among his kind. He views
all those without it as inferior beings, doomed to crawl and struggle in
the dust. He proves this to himself over and over by taking every opportunity
to attack those below him. But his sneering superiority hides deep insecurity.
He's unsure of himself as a warrior, doubts his commitment to the Decepticon
cause, and suffers an almost crippling fear of someday being trapped on
the ground.
