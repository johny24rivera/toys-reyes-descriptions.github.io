not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold

       This version of Darth
Vader is another one of those lame-o store exclusive "repaints" where practically
no effort was put into the thing at all. Basically, for this Wal-Mart exclusive
version, the dull dark blue on the original SWTF Darth Vader has been changed
to a light silvery gray. Otherwise, he's exactly the same as the mass-release
version. Boooo. Still, the light silvery gray does look better next to
the black than the dark blue, and I think makes for a slightly better color
scheme.

          Now Obi-Wan Kenobi here
is more of a proper repaint than Darth Vader. His shade of gray has been
changed to a slightly lighter shade, and his dark red has been replaced
with a nice shade of dark blue. That's not all that's changed, however--
although none of his paint masks have changed, some of his metallic bronze
parts have been replaced with a REALLY nice metallic gold, and a lot of
the dark brown parts have been replaced with black, which I think goes
with the other colors considerably better than the brown. Overall I think
it looks noticeably better than the original Obi-Wan SWTF toy, with the
colors contrasting considerably better.

           If you don't mind the
concept of Star Wars Transformers, this is a hard set to not at least mildly
recommend. You get a slight discount over what you'd get if you pick up
both toys seperately, both toys have better paint jobs than their original
mass-releases, and both are okay (though not spectacular molds). No real
reason to pick up the originals now, if you don't have them already.
