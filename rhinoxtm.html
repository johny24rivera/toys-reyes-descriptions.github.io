    Beast mode is a metallic
rhinoceros. He has some robot hands and his chest under his upper belly,
but this is still a very nice beast mode, with a well-proportioned head,
body, and legs. His horn is very large and menacing, and the detailing
is exquisite, with several wires and tubes running all over his gray metallic
skin.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Vehicle mode is a rhino
with tank treads for back legs and skis for front legs. Gives some speed
to Rhinoxs bulky body and looks like a cross between a snowmobile, a rhino,
and a tank. His actual tank treads cant roll, though. A decent vehicle
mode overall.

   <font face="OCR A Extended">
    Robot mode is large
and muscular. His face looks like that of a sumo wrestler's, though. His
only extras are a small backpack of parts on his upper back and his rhino
head halves on his shoulders, as well as some small stomach panels hanging
off his sides. His horn becomes a sword. He can stand up very well in this
mode, and he has a nicely detailed main body.

    A very nicely done transformer;
highly recommended. Transformation may hurt your fingers, though.
