      This time around, Ramjet
has a scheme that's a bit more realistic, given his vehicle mode. It's
definitely got a military feel to it, what with the gray-green and grayish
blue. The colors mesh pretty nicely, and the gold chest plate in robot
mode also looks very good. I'm not too crazy about the odd orange-hued
cockpit, although the color itself does fit in somewhat with the rest of
Ramjet. Unfortunately, Armada Ramjet's color scheme wasn't what bothered
me about him...

      Ramjet is a pretty cruddy
Minicon, but that's because of the mold. The color scheme itself is pretty
neat- however, he's easily tossed aside in this set for the real prize...

        Holy CRUD, Tidal Wave
is an awesome repaint. In fact, he's one of the best repaints ever. The
white, gray, and transparent "energon" green go together extremely well
together, and the blue highlights are simply delicious. The real eye-catcher,
though, is the gold energon streaks on his arms, legs, and shoulders. They
look huggin' awesome, like he's got so much power he can't contain it anymore.
It's a little bit hard to see from certain angles- which is why I might
have liked the yellow lightning bolts that were on the prototype slightly
better- but these are still nearly as awesome. The black, orange, and light
green spots here and there make great contrast colors, and give Tidal Wave
quite the repertoire of colors on him without making him too busy. Really
an inspired scheme.

        Tidal Wave is, in my
opinion, the 2nd best repaint ever (only
        <a href="enunicron.html">
         Energon

        is better). Add this onto the fact that he's a kickin' toy
with few flaws, and you've got yourself a must-buy Transformer, even IF
you already own the original. (Although if you're only going to pick one,
obviously choose this one.) I've just sat and stared at this guy for the
longest time. He's so freakin' awesome. Buy him! Buy him now!

          Tidal Wave is one of the largest Decepticon
warriors with a weapons arsenal as menacing as his size. His continued
exposure to raw Energon caused excessive damage to various parts of his
body. These damaged parts were eventually replaced with pure Energon, boosting
Tidal Wave's strength and making him nearly invincible. He transforms into
a powerful warship and is able to unleash a full-scale assault on his enemies
from a single location. Although he is massive and powerful, Tidal Wave's
lack of intelligence prevents him from becoming a true Decepticon leader.
