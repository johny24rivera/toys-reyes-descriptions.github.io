    Nitro Bumblebee-- because
there just haven't been enough deluxe movie Bumblebee molds already. All
kidding aside, this version of Bumblebee does something uniquely different
from most of his other toys, in that his vehicle mode is in a sort of "meched-out"
state like the "Stealth Force" gimmick seen in the movie and the subline
toys of the same name. More specifically, Bumblebee has big bronze nitro
boosters sticking out his back end in this mode, with some meched-up gunmetal
gray detailing tracking in lines down his roof, the rear sides, and his
windows. These "tech" details really add to this mode, really making the
Camaro alt mode stand out among most of the other DotM toys. The tech lines
also have another purpose-- they "connect" four out of Bumblebee's whopping
five Mechtech ports in this mode, which means that you can pimp Bumblebee
out with a TON of Mechtech weapons in this mode. As for the rest of the
mode outside of the engines and the tech detailing, it's pretty standard
fare for his Camaro alt mode, with the yellow/black coloration and transparent
blue windows, along with his stripes having some neat "racing paneling"
detailing on them. You either like Bumblebee's color scheme by now or not;
this version isn't going to change that. His paint detailing is pretty
good in this mode for the most part, particularly with his aforementioned
"tech" detailing and nitro boosters all painted. The front grill and stripes
are also painted, though the rear bumper and license plate aren't painted,
and neither are the wheel hubs-- all things considered, however, these
are minor details compared to what makes Nitro Bumblebee "Nitro". No robot
mode extras are present in this mode either, and the transparent dark blue
is dark enough where you can't see the parts behind his windows. Also,
even though the very rear of his side windows are actually painted and
not transparent plastic, the shade of dark blue used is so close to how
the transparent plastic looks you really have to pay attention to notice,
so kudos to the color-matching there. As for his Mechtech weapon, by pressing
back on the light gray switch near its back end, the weapon transforms
from a thick-barreled shooter to a a longer, two-barreled gun. However,
at least on mine the gearing doesn't line up well half the time and the
two side barrels don't swing out all the way, which is a major bummer.
Like most Mechtech weapons, you also can't "lock" Bumblebee's weapon into
its activated (two-barreled gun) mode, which combined with the other issue
makes Bee's weapon rather underwhelming.

    Bumblebee's robot mode
tries a few different things in the transformation-- specifically, in terms
of how the doors fold back and how the legs fold out-- but unfortunately,
they should have stuck to the "tried-and-true" method of previous deluxe
Movie Bumblebees. Bee looks way too bulky in some respects and mis-proportioned
in this mode. For one, his side chest pieces fold forward, which makes
his chest look accurately fragemented, but it also means that the sides
of his hood come up too close to his head, and it makes his chest stick
out too much. His windows and hood also fold up behind his back in a very
haphazard and inefficient manner, his door/front wheel assemblages in particular
not splaying out behind his shoulders enough and getting in the way of
arm movement. His arms are also a bit too skinny proportionally, though
they're admittedly not all THAT bad. The legs generally look okay, except
for the large pieces hanging off his upper legs, which don't even fold
onto the legs or anything and just look unsightly. The mold detailing on
Bumblebee's robot parts is very good, however, with his arms and waist
having particularly intricate movie-accuarate detailing on them. His headsculpt
is also spot-on, though I figured given how "pumped up" he is his face
mask would be slid down. His robot parts are also almost completely bereft
of paint apps, with only a few on his shoulders, lower legs, and head.
His lower arms in particular really need some paint. As for articulation,
Bumblebee can move at the neck, shoulders, elbows (at two points), hips
(at two points), knees (at two points), and slight forward-and-backward
motion at the ankles. He could really use some more movement in the shoulders,
but otherwise it's adequate for the size class. One last thing worth pointing
out-- Bumblebee gains ANOTHER two Mechtech ports in this mode, one on the
backside of each of his lower arms.

    Nitro Bumblebee has
a really unique and original vehicle mode design what with the turbo boosters
and tech detailing, and he's got a lot of ports to really arm him out the
wazoo. However, his robot mode design is a bit oddly proportioned with
some obvious kibble that gets in the way of movement more than it should
have. If you want a "meched-up, beefed-up" Bumblebee, this is probably
the way to go-- but the more "normal" deluxe Bumblebee molds are better
designs overall.

      With his mix of loyalty, smarts and
fighting skill, Bumblebee is one of the most admired Autobots. His vehicle
mode gives him the ablity to attack Decepticons just as quickly as he can
rush to the aid of a fallen Autobot comrade.
