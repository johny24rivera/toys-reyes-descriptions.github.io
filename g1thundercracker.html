    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to G1 Starscream. For a review
on the mold itself, read the review of G1 Starscream
    <a href="g1starscream.html">

    .)

     Thundercracker's color
scheme is kinda of the polar opposite of Starcream's- whereas Starscream
was mostly silverish-gray with a little bit of dark blue, Thundercracker
is mostly dark blue with a little bit of silver. I think this scheme works
quite a bit better, though, especially since that dark blue is a wonderful
metallic color that I could just stare at for... well, maybe not hours,
but MINUTES on end. Thundercracker's orange cockpit window also contrasts
nicely with the blue- orange and dark blue tend to do that. The stickers,
although the same shape as they were on Starscream, are subtly different
in their details, so it's not QUITE as obvious that Thundercracker's a
repaint. Kinda, sorta. Okay, maybe not. But the effort is appreciated.

     Thundercracker still
carries all the mold flaws that Starscream had, as well as the few features,
so he retains all the pros and cons mold-wise that Starscream has.

     Thundercracker is a
nice color improvement over Starscream's scheme, especially that delicious
metallic dark blue.
     <a href="g1skywarp.html">
      Skywarp

     is a bit better,
though, in my opinion, and the $35 price tag is still insane.

       Thundercracker is contemptuous of anything
that canÂ’t fly. Although a ruthless model of action in the battle against
the Autobots, he remains an independant thinker who is not wholly convinced
by Decepticon dogma. Equipped with powerful drone rockets can incendiary
gun. Capable of producing powerful and highly accurate earth-shaking sonic
booms that can be heard up to 200 miles away. Devastatingly powerful -
inhibited only by doubts about his cause.
