    Beast mode is a transmetal
cheetah. This mode is extremely nice- in fact, I think the best Beast Wars
beast mode. Only from a straight-on side view can you see the tip of the
robot head poking out from Cheetor's beast stomach, but that's it. The
detailing is very good as well, with hydraulic cylinders and metal plate
details everywhere. The tail, which becomes a whip in robot mode, is crafted
into a curved position, making it seem more realistic. The cheetah head
has a big, noticeable line running down the middle of it, though (this
is because they form the robot hands), and it subtracts a little from the
"sleek" look of the head. The color scheme is almost entirely different
from the original
    <a href="cheetortm.html">
     Cheetor Transmetal
    </a>
    - the
silver has been replaced by a fiery red, and some the blue replaced by
black. This gives this Transmetal a very fiery look to him, and, although
it does not resemble a cheetah's much, it still looks very neat.

    "Vehicle mode" is actually
just flipping out little rocket jets on the sides of Cheetor's stomach.
Although this isn't much of a vehicle mode, it still looks pretty nice,
and not weird-looking like some other Transmetal and Transmetal 2 vehicle
modes.

    Robot mode doesn't look
quite as good as the beast mode, in my opinion, but still looks very nice,
and definitely contributes to the "organic" robot mode that the Transmetals
are going for. The color scheme takes on a bit more of a silverish tone
in this mode, with the chest, upper arms, part of the face, and the upper
inner legs being all silver, or at least partially silver. There is also
some aquamarine on the face, and is a nice contrast to the red. There not
that many extras in this mode, either. The only major one is the front
cheetah legs and upper back attached to the back of Cheetor Transmetal's
robot mode like a backpack. This doesn't get in the way too much, though.
The only other extras are the halves of the cheetah head stuck on the bottom
of the robot mode hands and lower arms, and while these don't get in the
way, they look odd, especially when viewed from above. The only major complaint
I have about this mode is that, overall, this mode seems to have too much
of a "beefy and bulky" look to it- not much like Cheetor, in my opinion.

    A very nice transformer
in both modes. Recommended over the original Cheetor Transmetal, but only
if you like the color scheme leaning away from a cheetah's.

      Following the massive quantum surge,
Cheetor emerged as a cybernetically enhanced cheetah. Meanwhile, his robot
form inherited the organic traits once attributed to his beast mode. Now
Cheetor prowls the jungle with more agility and power than ever before.
Flip-out cyber-thrust wings provide enhanced speed and limited flight while
in beast mode, making him part jet, part mechanical cheetah.
