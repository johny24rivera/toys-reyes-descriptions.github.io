    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Autobot Alliance Brimstone.
For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Autobot Alliance Brimstone

     Chopsaw seems to be a
much more fitting name for this mold, even though Brimstone itself was
a cool name. Regardless, this redeco takes the roughly opposite approach
of Brimstone, with the main color being a dull red instead of blue. The
neutral color-- instead of a blah milky gray-- is now a sickly greenish
tan color. Honestly, I've never been impressed with the light milky gray
plastic on a lot of Transformers, but I still prefer it over this weird
shade of green-tan. It doesn't look good at all, and it just makes it look
like the figure's eternally under bad lighting (or has the flu). Instead
of Brimstone's flame paint apps, Chopsaw has more straightforward yellow
racing stripes across several of his red parts. These contrast pretty nicely
with the red, though in terms of catching the eye I think Brimstone's flames
work a little better. (That said, the extra little yellow stripes on Chopsaw's
head do look really nice here.) A few other colors like metallic copper
and silver-gold are also here and there as accents and help to add a bit
more to the color scheme, and look cool enough. Since Chopsaw is in the
"Reveal the Shield" subline, he has an allegiance rub sticker on the left
side of the top of his motorcycle mode-- rub it to reveal he's a Decepticon.

     Chopsaw is a decent
enough redeco-- not outright bad by any means, though I wish that sickly
greenish tan was a more interesting color-- or heck, even a boring color
like light gray, as opposed to the slightly ugly shade it is. The red and
black plastic and paint apps all look nice, but overall I think the original
release of this mold as Brimstone looks a bit better and I'd recommend
that more (not to mention Brimstone's a lot easier to find).

       Most Decepticons are motivated by power
or speed or ambition, but Chopsaw just likes to cut stuff in half with
his saws. That's really all the reason he needs to follow Megatron. He'll
follow any leader who indulges his maniacal tendency towards destruction.
Everywhere Chopsaw goes, he leaves behind a smoking trail of bisected rubble.
