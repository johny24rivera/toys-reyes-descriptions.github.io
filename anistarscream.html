    Starscream's vehicle
mode is as it's always been-- a jet, though done up in the slightly exaggerated
Animated style. The nosecone is longer than on most other TF jets we've
gotten, and the main and tail wings are slanted forward, an interesting
design differentiation from most jets. From a top-down view, Starscream
looks pretty good, with the red and black paint apps helping to break up
the dull blue. I'm not sure WHY dull blue is Starscream's main color, though,
as his main color on the show is clearly more greyish, but all of his toys
are roughly this same shade of blue. Odd, and I think it leads to a color
scheme that just looks rather boring, truth be told. Granted, I never thought
his traditional gray/red color scheme was all that exciting, but it was
still more eye-catching than this. Like most Animated toys, his mold detailing
is relatively sparse, being only where needed for the most part. The inside
of the cockpit has some pretty intricate detailing, though, which is pretty
nice. From a side view, Starscream looks considerably less impressive in
this mode. Like many jet Transformers, he's got some pretty noticeable
undercarriage junk, mostly consisting of his upper legs and his arms in
between them-- the hands are particularly noticeable from a rear view.
His robot feet are also blatantly folded up at the back end. However, he
does have a few features to partially make up for this-- his two missile
launchers can also be rotated backwards to look like jet thrusters, and
he has three retractable landing gear.

    Starscream's robot mode
is more impressive than his vehicle mode, that's for sure. For one, is
overal proportions are great-- I really like how his form shows both litheness
and strength at the same time, what with being generally skinny while still
having fairly wide upper arms. His claw-like curled fingers also look pretty
cool, as well. In addition, he has a pretty cool "automorph" gimmick during
transformation-- as you rotate his waist into its proper robot mode position,
the front part of his nosecone retracts automatically into his cockpit
to form a better-proportioned chest and his arms partially fold out. (It
also works in reverse when you're transforming him back to vehicle mode.)
His wings hook onto his upper back like a backpack, though they don't hook
in very well-- they come undone far too easily. Also, a small portion of
his rear backpack splits and forms two smaller wings that turn at a perpendicular
angle from the two main wings. I'm not sure why this is, as not only is
this not show-accurate, but it leaves too dangly little fragile parts just
hanging out there that also tend to fall off fairly easily. Other QA issues
have also seen pretty widespread reports with this mold, such as loose
arms and loose ankles. He also has overly tight missile launchers on his
lower arms, which are supposed to be able to slide up and down on his lower
arms when you push in a certain button, but this doesn't work very well.
Some other, more aesthetic quibbles I have are that his arm-mounted missile
launchers really aren't at all show-accurate (they'd need to be considerably
skinnier), and his face sculpt is stretching it even for an Animated figure--
I mean, that is one HUGE chin, there. His articulation quite good-- he
can move at the neck, shoulders (at two points), elbows (at two points),
thumbs, four fingers on each hand on one joint, and he can also move at
the hips (at two points), knees (at three points), and his ankles are on
ball joints.

    Overall, the Voyager
class Animated Starscream mold is probably one of the weakest of the more
recent Starscream molds. He certainly has his pluses, like a nice top-down
view of his jet form, his "automorph" gimmick, and his general robot proportions,
but he has some pretty noticeable downsides as well, including some very
noticable undercarriage junk in vehicle mode and some QA issues in robot
mode. So I wouldn't say he's terrible, he's but not great, either.

      No one really likes Starscream, not
even other Decepticons. Who can blame them though? He'll do whatever it
takes to gain control of the Decepticons, even going so far as trying to
destroy his commander Megatron. Of course, he's also nearly as powerful
as Megatron, and just as sneaky. He's the fastest flier there is, and even
Optimus Prime would have a hard time beating him in a fight. He's the best
there is at what he does. Even so he sometimes overrates himself, and that's
why he's still second in command.
