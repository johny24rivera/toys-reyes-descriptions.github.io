    The big bad for the Season
1 finale gets a big $30 "Mega" toy. His alt mode is a tank... kinda. It's
basically a turret on top of compressed robot parts. The sides have some
fairly nifty tread details on them, but they're pretty clearly the legs
(though to be fair, the shoulders and arms that make up the front end of
the sides are less obvious). There's no back end to the tank at all; just
the turret above what is fairly clearly the robot chest and pelvis folded
on top of each other, and then the tread-legs on the sides. Of course it's
a large simplistic 5-step changer so one has to take that into account
when gauging your expectations, but even that said... they could've come
up with a better tank mode than this. It's just very weak. The mold detailing
is fairly sparse even by RID standards, primarily because of the size of
the toy. You've got some of the RID2015 signature "trio of divots" here
and there, and somewhat detailed tread wheels, but that's about it outside
of the bare minimum. Even the whole turret just has a couple of basic details
on it. I do like the "missle pack" details on the top of the side sections,
though. The color scheme is almost entirely charcoal black and purple.
Although I think a "pure" black would've worked better with the purple,
the black still looks pretty decent as it's got quite a lot of glitter
in it, so it looks semi-metallic. The purple is a fairly straightforward
shade and contrasts fairly nicely against the black, though I wish it was
metallic, too. Only the melee weapon is a semi-metallic plastic for some
reason, but that's it. There's also some silver paint that can be seen
on the front of the tank, but it's much more prominent in robot mode. The
silver looks great against the black, though I wish it was used more liberally--
there's wide sections of the toy that are just unbroken black. The robot
mode weapon sort of sticks on top of the turret rather oddly, not blending
into the mode at all, but at least it stores somewhere.

    A special note here
about the transformation-- it's only on a small section of the box and
it's not entirely clear in what order the steps are. Apparently you have
to turn and pull up on the cannon first and then right afterwards transform
the legs. If you don't you WILL break the toy. In addition, gears in the
chest can become misaligned very easily and break regardless. The parts
that break are in or are connected to interior parts in the chest, so there
is no way to correct this issue if it happens-- you're SOL. This is an
absolutely HUGE oversight by Hasbro. I mean, I'm in my thirties and despite
being careful, I broke the toy the first time I transformed it back from
tank mode. (Hence the stock images used for this review.) This toy is meant
for young kids, and to have something absolutely ESSENTIAL to the toy break
SO easily and without any clear instructions on how to avoid it is a failure
from Hasbro on the most basic level. The entire point of this toy is that
a young kid can transform it without help. But with it breaking so easily
even when carefully handled by a man in his 30s, what chance do little
kids have of having this toy for long without it breaking!?

    Anyways, onto the robot
mode. This mode actually looks prety good, with some fairly good proportions.
I love the tank/shoulder sections that make for pretty bulky shoulders,
and the arms, chest, and legs are pretty proportional. (The legs are just
a touch long/wide, but it's not too bad.) The turret is a pretty big obvious
piece of kibble behind his head, but with that being it for a simplified
changer in terms of kibble that's actually not too bad. The colors are
also broken up much better in this mode, with plenty of silver paint on
the chest, abs, and upper legs, along with purple on the arms, lower legs,
turret and weapon, and tread wheels. Again, the mold detailing is very
minimal with only a few decorative details, but the black is certainly
less prevalent. Unfortunately because of the transformation gimmick, his
articulation is quite limited even by the standards of much of this simplistic
gimmick size class-- his arms can move forward at the elbows. That's it.
If you even move the elbows back much they spring-load back behind the
shoulders, so he really can't pose much at all. The cannon nozzle comes
off and can mount on one of his arms like a fusion cannon, and his other
arm can hold his melee weapon-- a shame he can't use/aim them that much.

    The 5-step version of
Megatronus has a pretty nice-looking robot mode, but that's about as much
praise as you'll get out of me about this toy. He has basically no articulation,
his tank mode is VERY weak, and worst of all, it's DIFFICULT TO TRANSFORM
HIM WITHOUT BREAKING HIM PERMANENTLY. This is always a bad thing on ANY
toy, but ESPECIALLY on a simplistic toy meant for young kids-- and one
that's $30, no less-- this is an absolute failure. Not even completists
should bother with this train wreck. Get the Legion class version if a
kid wants an easy-to-transform version of this character.
