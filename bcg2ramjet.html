not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Classics Starscream. For

     "G2 Redux" Ramjet is
a great idea-- taking the ever-popular Classics Seeker mold and applying
the rather unique Generation Two Ramjet toy's paint job to it, complete
with all the little symbols and decals. The general color scheme is a nice
shade of purple and black-- rather basic Decepticon colors-- but with a
bit of a curve ball thrown in with some dull aquamarine. I quite like the
result-- all of the colors complement each other extremely well, and the
aquamarine makes the color scheme interesting and a bit "G2-ish" without
going over-the-top and making the toy outright loud, so even those who
aren't normally fans of the late G1/G2 color schemes could get to like
this one. What's also great about this toy is that it replicates all the
decals that were on the original G2 Ramjet toy-- from the "DC 002" bits
on the tail fins, to the "AIR INTAKE" triangles near the engines, to the
simple "RAMJET" letters under the cockpit, to the details on the knees
and shoulders in robot mode. (In fact, the detailing on the inside of his
shoulders in robot mode IS a sticker, interestingly enough.) The sheer
number of paint details-- between that and all the little silver bits and
whatnot on the toy-- could never have been done on a mass retail release,
and it's all pulled off remarkably well here.

     From a first glance
you'd think that no changes have been made to the mold beyond those originally
made for
     <a href="clasramjet.html">
      Classics Ramjet
     </a>
     , but you'd be wrong--
the nosecone on G2 Ramjet here is now rubberized, almost certainly to conform
with toughening safety standards.

     "G2 Redux" Ramjet is
a great homage to an old toy with a great color scheme, but not a great
mold. Fortunately, this time around, it all IS on a great mold, and is
just pulled off spectacularly well. Highly recommended, if you're in the
market for the more high-end collectible side of the toy market.

       Ramjet has always been something of
a loser. Lacking both intelligence and luck, he could only resort to brute
force to make his way in Megatron's army. With the Decepticons now scattered
to the stars, Ramjet made his way back to Earth, hijacking human convoys
and renting himself out as muscle to tinpot dictators. But he's just hit
the motherload. A simple mugging of an Autobot courier named Motormouth
has yielded a canister of Forestonite. Now able to sheathe himself in a
whirling, drill-like force field while flying, he can safely ram his foes
without crashing himself, though the process leaves him dizzy and disoriented.
Ever since then, Ramjet's luck has changed for the better... unfortunately
for him, the head of the Decepticon Syndicate, Clench, doesn't take kindly
to freelancers on his turf.
