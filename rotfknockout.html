    Knock Out's vehicle mode
is a modern "sleek" motorcycle, and it looks pretty good overall. A couple
of hinges and the bottom of his upper legs can be seen fairly easily in
this mode, but otherwise there are no robot extras. The proportions are
more-or-less spot-on, and the mold detailing is pretty good-- all the necessary
details in his tires, engine and the like are where you'd expect, but they
don't go to overboard with it and risk losing Knock Out's sleek look. Sadly,
Knock Out has no kickstand to stabilize him in this mode, which is the
only major flaw I'd give it, though his front wheel can turn left or right
to give him a bit of weighted balance one way or the other. What's really
striking about Knock Out, though, his color scheme-- the various stark
colors of green, light blue, and white, against a mostly-black "background"
serve to make one very eye-catching (but not wholly unrealistic) color
scheme. Some say it's an homage to Beast Wars Waspinator, but that could
just be a coincidence. The only color I'm not fond of is the dull brownish
gray, but it's used fairly sparingly and only for "connection" pieces so
that's a minor quibble.

    Knock Out's robot mode
is equally good, with, again, great proportions and a nice overall look
to him. The wheel halves on his shoulders, instead of just being kibble,
complement the look of the mode, I think. I also love how the windshield
splits in half and folds downwards to form Knock Out's unique chest design.
His head sculpt is very monstrous and insect-like, which makes me wonder
why he's branded as an Autobot-- that head just SCREAMS Decepticon to me.
There's lots of nice robotic detailing on Knock Out's lanky legs, and the
motorcycle mode panels on the sides of said legs can pop off easily-- though
they're supposed to. They can, in fact, be relocated onto Knock Out's back
in this mode, though I prefer to keep them on the legs since when they're
on the back they kind of get in the way of movement. Knock Out's hands
are merely molded into his motorcycle seat pieces, but proportionally they
still pass, and I do like how they turned his engine into a gun-hand--
pure creativity, there. Knock Out's lone piece of vehicle kibble in this
mode (at least that isn't removable) is the wheel behind his back, though
fortunately it doesn't get in the way of movement. Speaking of movement,
Knock Out can move at the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles--
and most of these are on ball joints, so you can get a pretty wide range
of motion out of him. His small feet do limit the poses he can do somewhat
because of balance issues, though.

    RotF Knock Out is a
great motorcycle TF design, looking great proprtionally in both modes.
He has a few minor flaws, such as the lack of a kickstand in vehicle mode
and a couple of pieces of vehicle "kibble"Â  and relative lack of stability
in robot mode, but his nice, inventive (though not too complex) design
more than make up for it. Of all the color schemes this mold's been released
in, this one-- the original, still remains the best, in my opinion, as
the combination of white, light green, blue, and black is very striking.
Highly recommended.

      Though he is an incredibly flashy and
skilled fighter, Knock Out is also desperately insecure. He practices awesome
combat maneuvers constantly in private to be sure that the other Autobots
will notice him on the battlefield. His highest ambition is to be the leader
of a special combat team, and to get the combination retrofit everyone
has been talking about.
