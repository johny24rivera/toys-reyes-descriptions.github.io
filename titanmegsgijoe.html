    This form of Megatron
is loosely based on a Transformers/GIJOE crossover comic from a while back.
In vehicle mode, Megatron is a tank. However, all things considered, this
mode's a bit of a dissapointment. The color scheme is nice enough-- the
gray, black, silver, and purple all fit together well, and there's a good
amount of paint and mold detailing. I especially like the intricate mold
detailing on the treads and the "Autobot insignia kills" on the sides of
the tank mode. (Though really, if you think about it, having the commander
of the Decepticons only killing five Autobots is kind of pathetic.) The
stylized "M" in the dead center of the front of the tank mode is also a
nice touch, as well, without being so incredibly obvious it looks tacky.
The main problem I have with this mode is that it looks far too boxy--
in fact, it's almost completely square. Both ends, especially the front,
should be curved substantially more. The hip hinges on the front also don't
look all that great, either, and make it too obvious that the robot legs
form the sides of this mode. And, although the main gun can move up and
down and the little side gun on the top of the tank can swivel around,
the actual top of the tank itself can't swivel around at all-- something
that's rather inexcusable at this scale. The back end of the tank is also
hollow, though that's a minor downside compared to the others just mentioned.

    In robot mode, Megatron
looks significantly better, though he still looks rather stiff. His proportions
are pretty much spot-on, and the detailing on his robot parts are very
nice. Some have complained about the molding done on Megatron's face, but
I honestly don't see any problem with it all-- it looks pretty Megatron-y
to me. Moving the large gun to the right shoulder is a bit of a nod to
his "traditional" G1 self, though relocating it to the lower arm like on
said G1 toy would have looked a little better, methinks. Megatron is a
rather small for a 6" Titanium figure, but he's almost all diecast, which
makes up for it-- only his head, hip hinges, fists, feet, guns, and a few
other minor hinges are plastic. However, he has pretty limited articulation--
he can move at the head, shoulders, elbows, and wrists, which is good enough,
but his legs can barely move at all-- his knees can just barely bend, and
if you try to move his hips much, his hip hinges and pegs come apart WAY
too easily, so it makes it a real pain to try to pose him there. In fact,
many have reported that the hip pegs on theirs are so loose that they come
apart just from the sheer weight of the diecast, though thankfully mine
isn't THAT bad. What does seem to be universal on these toys, though are
the severe floppiness of the shoulder and elbow joints. Both are on balljonts,
which in general is a baaad idea for a diecast toy. As such, both are so
floppy as to be almost impossible to pose, as they just flop back down
to hanging off the shoulders. It's a real shame, as these are real annoyances
that detract quite a bit form an otherwise quite decent robot mode.

    TF/GIJOE Megatron has
a rather iffy vehicle mode, but a nice-looking robot mode. The execution
of the toy is worse than its design, however-- given the floppy shoulder
and elbow joints, how hard of a time the waist has staying together, and
the very stiff legs-- it's not something I can recommend to anyone except
the biggest completists or Megatron fans.

      Megatron does not suffer fools gladly.
Yet here he is, forced by the power of the Matrix to obey the commands
of a simpering braggart in a hood, and a fleshling no less! Still, Megatron
is nothing if not patient. Let that shrill simpleton Cobra Commander collect
his trinkets and treasures. Megatron will watch, and wait for his time
to strike.

      His chance is given him, shockingly,
by the Autobots, whose cooperation with G.I. JOE has smashed Cobra's outer
defenses. Feeding his own warriors into the furnace of Cobra Commanders
insane tactics, Megatron holds one desire at the forefront of his mind
 he will see his tormentor dead and the Matrix in his hand before the
Autobots arrive.
