    (NOTE: Because this is a repaint, this is
not a full-blown review. This mainly covers any changes made to the mold
and the color scheme, and merely compares it to Legends of Cybertron Hot
Shot. For a review on the mold itself, read the review of Legends of Cybertron
Hot Shot

     Odd that they made a
Hot Shot repaint of Bumblebee considering that he got his own
     <a href="clasbumblebee.html">

     </a>
     in Classics, as well.... Well, anyways, they certainly painted
up the toy to look pretty spot-on Bumblebee-- a yellow and black little
car has always been Bumblebee's forte, and it certainly isn't changed by
this toy. The yellow is a fairly bright color, but the black keeps it from
being too overpowering. Silver is used on the headlights and the robot
face, but truth is it doesn't really provide enough contrast against the
yellow like the black does. The dull sky blue and red paint apps really
provide a nice contast to the yellow and help to vary the color scheme
a bit, but they're only used on the chest in robot mode, unfortunately.
And that's my biggest complaint with Legends Bumblebee-- he just doesn't
have enough color variation. If he had more paint apps of the blue or red
variety, he'd look considerably better, especially in vehicle mode where
pretty much all you can see are yellow and black.

     No mold changes have

     Legends Bumblebee is
a fairly dissapointing repaint of the second-worst Legends class mold (at
least as of this writing, 4/07). The actual color scheme isn't all that
bad, but he badly needs more paint apps and color variation to have something
else besides all that yellow and black. About on par with LoC Hot Shot
in terms of recommendation, but he falls short of the
